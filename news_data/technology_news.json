            "content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. There are more than 114,000 missing persons in Mexico, and that number is continuing to rise. Criminal violence in the country is at a record level, largely driven by gangs and drug cartels. Many of those missing are buried in clandestine graves all across the country. To contribute to the solution of this complex problem, a group of scientists from the Center for Research in Geospatial Information Sciences (CentroGeo) put technology and data analysis at the service of the searches. \"I never thought I would have to work on this, but if this knowledge is of any use, now is the time to show it,\" says José Luis Silván, a geographer at CentroGeo. Years ago, as part of his doctoral work, he specialized in measuring forest biomass and human populations through satellite information. At that time, he was far from imagining the scientific work he is doing today: investigating the potential of drones, hyperspectral images, and protocols to detect clandestine graves. Posters of missing persons cover the walls of police stations in Juarez. In a recent article published in the International Journal of Forensic Research and Criminology, José Silván and researcher Ana Alegre insist that studying the geographical environment is important to understand in depth a crime like disappearance. Thus, “due to its context and diversity of climates, the case of Mexico may represent an opportunity for the development of investigations.” Finding burials requires hard work. All available information and resources must be optimized. Therefore, scientists have evaluated the use of remote sensing tools and have systematized information from previous findings. They seek to discover patterns in the behavior of the perpetrators and, with this, to find burials. According to Red Lupa, 88 percent of the 114,000 cases of disappearances in Mexico occurred between 2000 and May 2024. 10,315 were registered in 2023, the most on record. This represents an average of 29 people per day. Jalisco, Tamaulipas, State of Mexico, Veracruz and Nuevo Leon are the entities with the highest incidences. Justice is almost nonexistent, with 99 percent impunity for this crime. For this reason, since 2007 alone, civil society has formed more than 300 search groups, mostly made up of family members who scour the land guided by witness statements or organized in general brigades. These groups have detected most of the 5,696 clandestine graves reported on Mexican soil. The association United for Our Disappeared searches in the north of the country, in Baja California. One of its members, who preferred to remain anonymous, has been searching for his son for 18 years. He says they have been using pointed rods to detect graves for more than 10 years. This is one of the most widely used tools in Mexico for this purpose. \"We fit the rod in where we suspect the earth was removed, insert it, pull it out and smell it. If there are bone remains or tissue, you can tell by the smell. It is a strong odor, easy to detect. It smells like organic matter in the process of decomposition.\" Relatives of the disappeared and the National Search Commission in work at the end of 2022. Before, he says, they used a georadar—a device similar to a pruning shear that detects inconsistencies in the ground—but they abandoned this practice because it was not very useful. The radar responds to almost any kind of object, from chips to boats. The last time they used it, it returned 40 suspicious spots, but none were positive. In Mexicali, another group uses a drone to fly over areas and detect changes in the terrain. Others have used machines to dig holes instead of shovels. Some innovations are abandoned over time, but the use of rods remains. In 2014, after the disappearance of 43 Ayotzinapa normalistas in Mexico, Silván and other CentroGeo professionals joined the scientific advisory board on the case. During the search for the students, different civilian groups and government brigades detected dozens of illegal graves. In less than 10 months, the Mexican Attorney General's Office counted 60 sites and 129 bodies in the state of Guerrero. As a result of the raids, 300 illegal graves were revealed. Since then, the number of clandestine graves has only grown. No one anticipated the size of this horror. The report, “Searching between pain and hope: Findings of clandestine graves in Mexico 2020–2022,” exposes with hemerographic data that in those two years, 1,134 clandestine graves were registered, with 2,314 bodies and 2,242 remains. In proportional terms, Colima reported the highest rate of illegal graves, with 10 per 100,000 inhabitants. It was followed by Sonora, Guanajuato, Guerrero, Sinaloa and Zacatecas. By number of cases, Guanajuato, Sonora, and Guerrero stand out. These three entities account for 42 percent of the records. By April 2023, a journalistic investigation by Quinto Elemento Lab reported that the number of illegal burials reached 5,696 clandestine graves, and that more than half of them were detected during the current federal administration. Employing his field of study, remote sensing, José Luis Silván uses images captured with satellites, drones or airplanes, from which he extracts geospatial information using knowledge of the physics of light, mathematics and programming. Multispectral and hyperspectral images capture subsurface information using sensors that record wavelengths of light imperceptible to the human eye, making them useful for searching. In 2016, during a first study by CentroGeo researchers, they simulated burials with pig carcasses to evaluate the potential of using hyperspectral cameras in searches and learn what information from the sensors was useful to them. The Mexican researchers knew from research in other countries that successful detection with these techniques depends, in part, on being able to recognize how carcasses (and their spectral images) change in different soils and climates. The experiment was carried out on rented land in the state of Morelos. There they buried seven animals and evaluated the light reflected by the soil at different wavelengths for six months. They concluded that a hyperspectral camera, which provides more than a hundred layers of data, has the potential to detect clandestine burials, although the technique is only effective three months after burial. They tried to arrange for the acquisition of a camera and drone (valued at 5 million pesos) through the National Search Commission, but were unsuccessful. Faced with this, they began to evaluate more affordable alternatives, such as multispectral devices. Today, despite the fact that spaces such as the Commission for the Search for Disappeared Persons of the State of Jalisco (COBUPEJ)—with which they have a partnership—has acquired this equipment, no national strategy exists to deploy these technologies systematically. Some time later, the scientists took on a bigger challenge. When they briefed the National Search Commission on the usefulness of remote sensing for locating burials, officials told them that in some regions of the Northwest, the greatest need was to locate substances used to conceal crimes. \"They dispose of them in caustic soda or with chemicals, char them and incinerate them in the open air or in crematoria; they throw the remains away or bury them,\" the researcher says. So, in 2021, Silván's group did another experiment, this time in Hidalgo and with a spectroradiometer, which measures how different substances reflect light. For that study, they tested the trace of substances used in crimes. They found that diesel, muriatic acid, and blood treated with anticoagulants require more precise imaging to be located, but that most substances, such as caustic soda, lime, blood, and those resulting from open burning, could be detected with multispectral sensors, which are less expensive. CentroGeo has also participated in the development of complementary strategies to identify areas with a high probability of harboring clandestine graves. One example is the training of mathematical models with the coordinates of previous findings and the characteristics of the sites preferred by criminals, which they call clandestine spaces and which are defined as those which are easy to access for perpetrators and of low visibility to the population. In addition, they have been using the signs that decomposing bodies leave on the vegetation for years. As a corpse decomposes, it releases nutrients into the soil, in particular increasing the concentration of nitrogen. In plants, this element is linked to chlorophyll, which gives them their greenness. In experiments with buried pigs, they have observed that a chlorophyll indicator can be quantified through satellite images. They measure how fast this index grows to detect sites with anomalies. This tool is available on the \"Clandestine Space\" platform. This APP demonstrates the concept of Clandestine Space to delimit areas to search for human remains. Silván says that to interpret the nitrogen signal, they must consider that the gas signal can also vary due to the use of fertilizers or rains that carry nutrients. The presence of nitrogen, then, is not definitive proof of the existence of trenches, but it provides indications that justify paying attention in certain regions. The National Search Commission has been trained to use this indicator. In Baja California, a northern state with 17,306 missing persons cases, these strategies have already been used. They first analyzed 52 locations of known graves and deduced that, because of the way they were distributed, there was a high probability of finding more graves at a distance of between 18 and 28 kilometers from those already known. They also looked for possible \"clandestine spaces\" and identified that 32 percent of the territory of Baja California had the potential to be used for that purpose. Finally, they reviewed the concentration of chlorophyll in satellite images. The result was a useful accompaniment for some family brigades. Recently, Ana Alegre and José Silván analyzed geospatial models that could explain the distribution of graves in 10 states. They found that the travel time it would take an offender to get from urban streets to the grave is the factor that most influences the location of graves. \"The secrecy sought by perpetrators seemed less important than reducing the effort they invest in creating the grave,\" their article says. In 2019, alleged clandestine graves were searched in Veracruz. In addition to collaborating with the government, CentroGeo researchers work with civil associations such as Regresando a Casa Morelos and Fuerzas Unidas por Nuestros Desaparecidos en Nuevo León (FUNDENL). Some time ago, the former asked them to survey a site. \"We collected thermal images and three-dimensional models to provide information,\" says Silván. In addition, they gave a workshop for visual interpretation. Silván describes the members of Regresando a Casa Morelos as dedicated people. \"They want to find their loved ones, they are willing to learn anything, to analyze an image or fly a drone. To everything.\" With information from the FUNDENL collective and support from the American Jewish World Service, CentroGeo created “Huellas de vida,” a platform that crosses the information of unfound persons and unidentified bodies with data from objects found in clandestine burial sites in Nuevo León. The intention is to detect coincidences that will help solve cases. The geographer points out that the investigation is advancing, while the forms and numbers of disappearances are multiplying. Other countries, he says, are installing ground penetration radars on drones, or are planning to use electronic noses as indicators of methane, an element that corpses release at a certain stage of decomposition. To search for missing persons from the Spanish Civil War, for example, patterns in geographic data were tracked to narrow down search sites. Abandoned clothing near illegal graves on the outskirts of Iguala. The big pending issue is to evaluate the real contribution that geographic information has had in uncovering crime scenes. “It is complicated to have feedback, even with the National Commission, because they are not obliged to tell us where they have findings.” It will be until they have the new reports when they will be able to collate the results and measure the impact of their contributions. For now, “it is complicated to attribute the findings to our tools and information.” For his part, the member of FUNDENL assures that the search groups are the ones who have found most of the clandestine graves currently located. The usual thing, he says, is that the governments do not have departments for this work and only search when they have declarations that oblige them to do so. With the collectives it is different, because “we receive anonymous information, and even if we have no information, we still schedule searches and go out.” Finding graves is the beginning of another loss. When they have reason to excavate, they use picks and shovels and, if they find human remains, the authorities (who usually accompany them) cordon off the area and proceed with their work. If they are not present, they call them. “From there, many times we don't know what's going on, we don't get feedback from the authorities. We say that the person we found is lost again.” The problem is general; “the collectives complain that people get lost in the bureaucratic process.” In few cases, they say, the Prosecutor's Office restores the identity of the disappeared. While technology is integrated into the systematic searches, collectives such as FUNDENL ask society to share the information they have on missing persons. “We only want to find them, all the information that reaches the collectives is anonymous,” says the interviewee whose identity we reserve. The authorities have accepted this, he assures. For his part, José Silván comments that, as a result of the collaboration with COBUPEJ and other institutions, they are about to publish a book to disseminate techniques for the detection of graves that they tested during their work. The book is entitled Interpreting Nature to Find Them and is coordinated by Tunuari Chavez, head of the COBUPEJ context unit, and José Silván, under the direction of commissioner Victor Avila.

Of all the hardware announcements we might have been expecting next from Nintendo, a new alarm clock was not one of them. But the Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo is very real, and will be available exclusively to Switch Online customers later this week. Alarmo looks every bit the alarm clock you might imagine Nintendo would make, if you would have ever imagined Nintendo would make an alarm clock. Like something plucked straight from the nightstand of Mario himself, it’s a very on-brand shade of red, with a circular color screen and a large glowing dial on the top for control and snooze. It’s the result of a joint project between two sides of the business—hardware developer Tetsuya Akama and games developer Yosuke Tamori—who came together to work on an in-house project, with a goal of supporting people during their sleep. “It was only after a lot of technical trial and error and building many prototypes that we decided to focus on alarm clocks,” Tamori says. Alarmo features 35 scenes inspired by five Nintendo games—Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Splatoon 3, Pimkin 4, and Ring Fit Adventure—borrowing characters, objects, music, and sound effects from each of those gaming worlds to help stir you from your slumber. Simply choose your favorite game, pick a scene, set a time, and leave Alarmo to do its thing. That’s all backed up with built-in motion sensor technology, which was the developers' research focus, and how Alarmo came to be. “One of our in-house projects was to research motion sensor technology,” says Tamori. “As this sensor maintains privacy since it doesn’t use a camera, we had an idea for how it could be highly suitable for use in the bedroom, so we decided to kick off a new project to see what we could do with it.” That means the things you see and hear from Alarmo will change as you move, allowing you to snooze your alarm with a gesture and stop it entirely by getting out of bed. Nintendo says characters and interactions from your chosen game will get “more intense” the longer you stay in bed though, so there’s no getting away from getting up—but at least you’re rewarded with a “victory fanfare” for your efforts once you do. Gamifying sleep as an incentive to finally drag yourself out of bed? It could just work. That’s not all though. The motion sensor is also able to track your movement in the night, to see if you had a restful or restless night, which is all stored in Alarmo’s Records feature. This won’t work if you share your bed with another person (or a pet), mind you, which might say something about the Alarmo’s target demographic. Nintendo says more titles will be available via free updates in the future, with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing: New Horizons already in the works. Alarmo will cost $99.99 and is limited to Nintendo Switch Online customers in the US and Canada at launch, but Nintendo says it will be available to wider audiences early next year.

These plans for militia activity in the wake of the US election are not from a private conversation on an encrypted platform. It was unfolding on a public Facebook profile. Anti-government militia movements have been continuing to use Facebook to recruit, coordinate training, promote ballot box stake outs, and prepare for a civil war that many militants believe will break out after election day. And in some cases, the movement is attracting people who don’t appear to have any prior background in a militia. Meta is even doing the work for extremist movements by auto-generating some group pages on their behalf. Data shared exclusively with WIRED by the Tech Transparency Project shows that these groups have only continued to grow on Facebook, despite WIRED previously flagging this lapse in Meta’s moderation. The brazen proliferation of paramilitary activity on the social media platform days before the election highlights Meta’s lackadaisical approach to enforcing its own bans against groups it has labeled dangerous extremists. Militias require platforms like Facebook to grow: It’s a tool for the paramilitary movement to strengthen and radicalize its network. It also helps them facilitate local organizing, state by state and county by county, and boost their membership. The American paramilitary movement is much less visible than it was in 2020. Militias largely retreated from the streets after the January 6 Capitol riot exposed them to intense public and legal scrutiny, which was intensified by the prosecution of dozens of Oath Keepers. Some groups tried to distance themselves from the movement altogether by dropping any language about a “militia” from their websites, opting instead for more euphemistic names like “civilian guard” and “patriot group.” But after the dust settled following the Capitol riot, the movement began quietly rebuilding on Facebook. And they ramped up training and began coordinating, across counties and states. The Tech Transparency Project has compiled a list of 262 Facebook public and private groups and 193 Facebook pages for militia and anti-government activists that were created since January 6, 2021. Nearly two dozen of those groups and pages have been created since May, according to the TTP. Some make minimal effort to conceal their affiliations to extremist networks: One new public group created in May is called The Michigan III%. Increasingly, the movement is also relying on individual profiles associated with leaders of local militia, the TTP says. Moderation has put a dent in the presence of American Patriots Three Percent (AP3), one of the largest active militias that Facebook explicitly banned in 2020 as a “militarized social movement” and “armed militia group.” Meta, Facebook's parent company, says it carried out a “strategic network disruption” of AP3 in 2020 and again earlier this year in June, removing from Facebook and Instagram a total of 900 groups, pages, and accounts associated with members. \"Adversaries are constantly trying to find new ways around our policies, which is why we continually enforce against violating groups and accounts by investing heavily in people, technology, research, and partnerships,” a Meta spokesperson told WIRED in an email. “We will continue to remove any groups and accounts that violate our policies.” Meta says the company is investigating some of the screenshots of groups that WIRED shared and will remove any content that violates its policies. But WIRED reviewed posts from AP3 groups and profiles that are still on the platform, including examples where members and leaders brandish AP3 insignia and share photos from their in-person training sessions. There have also been some recent instances where Facebook has even auto-generated pages for militias. In May, Facebook auto-generated a page for AP3’s Arizona chapter. In June, Facebook auto-generated a page for “AP3 NM [New Mexico] Training Range.” If you hover over the information widget on the page, Facebook’s explainer reads: “This unofficial page was created because people on Facebook have shown interest in this place or business. It’s not affiliated with or endorsed by anyone associated with AP3 Training Range.” WIRED sent Meta two examples of auto-generated pages. In a statement, the company said: \"One of the two auto-generated Pages had one follower and has been removed, and we couldn’t even verify that the second example of an auto-generated Page exists on the platform.\" Meta has repeatedly come under fire in the past for auto-generating pages for extremist, white supremacist, and terrorist organizations; a whistleblower first flagged the issue in 2020 in a supplement to an earlier petition filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Nearly four years after the January 6 attack on the capitol, Facebook remains a significant recruiting and organizing tool for militias like the AP3, despite creating policies that ban them,” said Katie Paul, director of the Tech Transparency Project. “How can Meta be trusted to effectively thwart extremists that have a record of engaging in and stoking political violence when its own systems create business pages for them?” In a video from 2022 that was recently published as part of a leak to Distributed Denial of Secrets, AP3 leader Scot Seddon stressed the importance of Facebook to his group’s operational success. “We’ve always used Facebook, Facebook has been our greatest weapon. It has gotten us where we are today,” Seddon told the camera. “We need to use the tools that are in front of us to achieve the goals of where we want to be. Our goal is to network, be as big as possible, have as many like-minded patriots in our states that we can rely upon should shit hit the fan.” Extremist groups need access to mainstream platforms like Facebook to reach and radicalize people. When those groups are banned from larger platforms and relegated to fringe sites, their reach and recruitment opportunities are limited and their numbers can become stagnant or start dropping. “We know the power of Facebook as an organizing platform, to pull in people who have fallen down rabbit holes and radicalize them further,” says Jon Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. “We should be concerned that actual organized domestic extremist groups have free rein on platforms that millions of Americans use.” Now, as the election fast approaches, the paramilitary network on Facebook has been a hive of people looking to link up, train, and prepare. A review by WIRED of recent Facebook posts in a number of these militia groups also suggests that the paramilitary movement has lately been attracting individuals who don’t have previous experience of being part of a militia. “I’m looking for a group of people that see and understand the dire situation our country is in,” wrote one poster in the Facebook group U.S.A. Militia We The People last month. “A group of people that understand that civil war is at our doorstep if Kamala makes it into office. Am I in the right place?” In another post earlier this month in a group for a county-level militia in Virginia, a member shared that he and his wife were interested in joining up, before asking for more information about how to do so. Also earlier this month, a new member of a militia group in Oklahoma introduced himself as a military veteran and said he was a member of a militia from 2015 to 2017 but wants to get involved again. “My battle rattle is ready to go any time,” he added. Two county-level militias in Virginia have created Facebook pages in the past month, which they’ve used to coordinate their inaugural “musters” (militia speak for a meetup) in recent weeks. Another local Virginia militia has organized a meeting for two days after the election. The “commander” of a Three Percenter group in Kentucky—who posed for a photograph viewed by WIRED with Representative Thomas Massie last summer while wearing full gear and insignia—has used his profile to share images from training sessions and regularly makes inflammatory statements. In a recent post, he suggested that state militias ought to rally at their chosen state parks: “Three national base camps could be state or national parks … (for example) west in NV or CO, central Missouri and east WV or VA. Then get comms established.” In a “Patriot Group” in Barron County, Wisconsin, a recent lively discussion led by a “top contributor” urged members to “organize and monitor” ballot drop boxes. Several members of the group proposed planting small cameras in the vicinity of the boxes. Ballot drop surveillance has continued to be a hot topic of discussion among election deniers and paramilitary groups. Militias also teamed up with election deniers to conduct covert surveillance of ballot drop boxes during the midterm elections, recent leaks published by Distributed Denial of Secrets and reported by WIRED show. A recent DHS intelligence memo warned law enforcement agencies that domestic extremists could try to sabotage or attack ballot boxes. The administrator of a New Hampshire–based group called the MAGA Continental Army claims that he recently met with the local police chief to discuss preparations in the event that a civil war breaks out. “He told me if it came to civil war that he will be directing his officers to defend the people—they will not be coming after your guns,” he wrote. He added that the chief said all members should come to the police department if conflict broke out. In one public group called The Party of Trump, with 171,000 members, a discussion about ballot drop box monitoring prompted someone to suggest that Trump supporters come armed with their AR-15s to stand guard. In another public group called We Fight for Our Lives, someone urged others to get organized ahead of the election and suggested enlisting bikers and militia. “I’m ready to fight,” one person responded. “I’ll pull the fuckin trigger fo sho” the original poster added. In another public group called SAVE THE FLAG AMERICA, someone put the stakes of the election in bleak terms: “In a matter of days, we will ascertain our financial capacity to procure essential commodities such as groceries and fuel, or, alternatively face the prospect of engaging in armed conflict.” “Trump 2024,” someone responded. “God is always in control.” This story has been updated with additional comment from Meta.

But for pilots flying above, the region has become a danger zone for GPS jamming. The jamming in the region of Finnmark is so constant, Norwegian authorities decided last month they would no longer log when and where it happens—accepting these disturbance signals as the new normal. Nicolai Gerrard, senior engineer at NKOM, the country’s communications authority, says his organization no longer counts the jamming incidents. “It has unfortunately developed into an unwanted normal situation that should not be there. Therefore, the [Norwegian authority in charge of the airports] are not interested in continuous updates on something that is happening all the time.” Pilots meanwhile, still have to adapt, usually when they are above 6,000 feet in the air. “We experience this almost every day,” says Odd Thomassen, a captain and senior safety adviser at the Norwegian airline Widerøe. He claims jamming typically lasts between six and eight minutes at a time. A map of GPS jamming over Europe on 17 October 2024. When a plane gets jammed, warnings flash on cockpit computers and the GPS system used to warn pilots of a potential collision with terrain, such as mountains, stops working. Pilots are still able to navigate without GPS if they can communicate with ground stations nearby, explains Thomassen. But they are left with an eerie sense they are flying without the support of the latest technology. “You're basically [going] 30 years back in time,” he says. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, jamming has dramatically increased across Europe’s eastern edges, and authorities in Baltic countries openly blame Russia for overloading GPS receivers with benign signals, meaning they can no longer operate. In April, a Finnair plane trying to land in Tartu, Estonia, was forced to turn back 15 minutes before landing because it could not get an accurate GPS signal. Over the past decade, GPS systems have been considered so dependable that many smaller, more remote airports have started to rely on it completely instead of maintaining more expensive ground-based equipment, says Andy Spencer, a pilot and international flight ops specialist at OpsGroup, a member organization for pilots and others in the airline industry. “In Norway, you're probably looking at a lot of airports that only have GPS approaches,” he says, referring to the phase of the flight where planes descend to the runway. “If there is an issue with GPS signals, these airports can become off limits.” In Finland, even tractors capable of operating automatically have been disrupted. In May, the Finnish transport agency said the problem had intensified since Ukraine began targeting Russian energy infrastructure with drones, suggesting the jamming could be a side effect of Russia’s new drone defense systems. That same month, the agency changed its guidelines so that airlines have to report only GPS interference that has “exceptional effects.” NKOM also attributes jamming above northeastern Norway to Russia. “In Finnmark, the interference is Russian jamming of several GNSS bands [systems that help satellites and ground stations communicate], not only GPS, originating from some place on the Russian side of the border,” Gerrard tells WIRED. Pilots aren’t the only people affected, he stresses. Across Norway, there have been cases of fishing boats unable to carry out certain tasks and diggers on construction sites no longer able to dig precisely, he says. The Russian embassy in Oslo did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment. NKOM’s decision to stop tracking jamming in Finnmark sets a dangerous precedent, says Melanie Garson, a professor focused on international conflict resolution at University College London. “By not reacting, how do you enforce a deterrent effect?” she asks, adding it is still unclear whether the government is going to find a solution to the jamming problem or leave it to the industries that are affected. NKOM does try to “eliminate” GPS jamming when its source is inside Norwegian territory, says spokesperson Gerrard. The agency is also among several government departments that organizes the annual event Jammerfest, held on the Norwegian island of Andøya, to experiment with countermeasures. Since 2022, representatives from industry and government travel to the arctic circle to test how their systems respond to jamming and the more serious GPS spoofing, where GPS signals are faked to deceive a plane or other device about its own location. Yet Widerøe pilots are concerned that this issue might feel remote to the American companies that make a lot of the equipment inside their planes. They believe it is the American Navstar satellite system being targeted because other devices like iPads—which can pick up signals from multiple satellite constellations—still work throughout periods of jamming. “The providers of the navigation computers, they are mainly American,” says Rolf Fossgård, deputy VP of flight operations at Widerøe. He’s worried that if American businesses are not affected themselves, they might not be motivated to upgrade their systems to be jamming-resistant. “For a lot of European operators or Middle East operators, they are in need of this kind of equipment.” It's unclear how the situation in the skies above Finnmark is going to evolve. Since 2022, most interference has hit planes above 6,000 feet—suggesting the device that is causing the jamming is located on the ground, and that the more sensitive part of a plane's journey, at lower altitudes, is protected by the curvature of the Earth. But in April, Thomassen claims, he encountered his first case of jamming as he attempted to land. Flying into Båtsfjord, on Norway’s northern tip, his plane suffered jamming as it approached the runway. “We were able to land just fine based on visual contact with the airport,” he explains, adding that his company Widerøe is yet to verify why this case of jamming took place at such low altitudes. Luckily the surrounding area is very flat, he says. “Norway is a mountainous country, so if the jamming were in other parts of the country, operational impact would be significant.” In your inbox: Upgrade your life with WIRED-tested gear A bitcoin mining dream turned into a nightmare The Big Story: An oral history of WIRED’s original website I made a wholesome OnlyFans to try to make ends meet Event: Join us for WIRED Health on March 18 in London More From WIRED Reviews and Guides © 2024 Condé Nast.

            "content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. In May 2022, just months after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a disparate group of people from across the globe decided that they wanted to fight back. This turned into the North Atlantic Fella Organization (NAFO), a decentralized online activist network designed to combat pro-Kremlin propaganda, primarily focusing on the platform then known as Twitter. The members, identified by cartoon Shiba Inu avatars, mocked Russian government accounts and used meme warfare to disrupt Moscow’s propaganda over the invasion. But in November 2022, Elon Musk took control of the platform, changed its name to X, and effectively allowed Russia’s propagandists free rein to do whatever they wanted. While NAFO members continued to push back, posting memes in response to any posts from official Russian accounts, they knew they had to do something else to alter the course of the war. And so, over the course of the past two years, they have helped to raise tens of millions of dollars for Ukrainian frontline forces, funding weapons, ammunition, medical equipment, and vehicles—many of them branded with the distinctive NAFO livery. Among the items funded by these shitposting cartoon dogs is a $250,000 marine drone dubbed “Raccoon’s Revenge” that the Ukrainian government says was used to take out a Russian warship. The group has also funded thousands of drones that have become an increasingly important weapon in pushing back Russian forces. Those on the front line say that NAFO’s efforts are vital in combating Russia’s assault. “This is our only way to win, because the Russian army is bigger than us. We need more drones. It is very, very important,” Oleksandr Sokolenko, a commander of the drone unit in the 79th Air Assault Brigade, tells WIRED. When he spoke to WIRED earlier this month, Sokolenko said he was in a trench between Vuhledar and Kurakhove in the Donetsk Oblast in eastern Ukraine. Sokolenko first heard about NAFO’s work from a friend who was also in the Ukrainian army, and now believes the work they are doing to fund drones for his brigade is vital to their chances of winning the war. “In the beginning, when I joined the army, I was in the infantry. But I recognized that drones are really very critical,” Sokolenko says. “So I decided to work with drones. My first time [flying a drone] it was a DJI Mavic, I dropped grenades from it. Now, it's my main work.” Sokolenko, who joined the Ukrainian military when the war broke out, previously worked as an actor, appearing onstage and in movies. “It’s like Shakespeare said, all the world’s a stage,” Sokolenko joked, flagging that Ukrainian president Vlodomyr Zelensky had also been an actor before becoming a politician. Because of NAFO’s decentralized structure, it’s impossible to get specific figures on how many people identify as members of the movement—fellas, in NAFO parlance—but one member believes it has to be in the thousands at least. “You can't just fundraise $250,000 for a naval drone if there's not thousands of people [involved],” a UK-based fella, who did not want to be named over fears of threats from Russia, tells WIRED. That was funded in direct collaboration with United24, the Ukrainian government organization that was set up to allow people to help the Ukrainian war effort. “It all started in November 2022, when United24 launched the first fleet of naval drones, a project that would later change the course of the maritime war,” a spokesperson for United24 tells WIRED. “Fellas were eager to help and to encourage their initiative. We made a special offer: to fundraise a NAFO drone and brand it with a name of their choice.” The incentive worked, and in the space of just two months, NAFO had raised $276,429, and decided to call the drone Raccoon’s Revenge, a reference to the raccoons stolen by Russian zookeeper Oleg Zubkov during the Russian retreat from Kherson in November 2022. In total, NAFO has raised close to $1 million across four fundraising campaigns in collaboration with United24. Their current campaign—dubbed Fellas Fury—is seeking to raise funds for remote control combat robots. Beyond official fundraising efforts in conjunction with the Ukrainian government, NAFO members have also launched numerous separate campaigns conducted in close collaboration with troops on the ground. Because NAFO does not have a central leader, the fundraising efforts are organized on the basis of brigades or divisions, typically led by one person who has a connection to a particular unit or soldier in the Ukrainian army. These brigades and divisions usually focus on one specific item, whether its vehicles, rifles, drones, or medical equipment, and part of their fundraising efforts is the sale of patches, which have become a huge collectors item. The fundraising drives are organized on Discord, Signal, and Telegram—but not on X, the platform that the NAFO movement has thrived on for years. “People are being forced away from X, just because Russia basically bought the platform,” the UK-based fella tells WIRED, citing the prevalence of Russian bots and pro-Kremlin accounts allowed on the platform under Musk’s stewardship. X did not respond to a request for comment. One of the most successful and prolific NAFO fundraisers has been Ragnar Sass, who runs the NAFO 69th Sniffing Brigade, which has raised more than $10 million to date for Ukrainian troops. That money has allowed Sass and his brigade to send more than 460 vehicles to Ukrainian troops, as well as more than 1,000 drones and other equipment to soldiers on the ground. They have even rescued 32 Ukrainian pets. Sass’s brigade not only supplies the trucks, but also kits them out with custom technology designed specifically for combat such as jammers and night vision cameras. The trucks and jeeps are then painted, including NAFO lettering, and driven in convoys to the front lines in Ukraine. “What makes us different, is that we are analyzing every week what are the most effective electronic warfare solutions,” Sass tells WIRED while coordinating his brigade’s 33rd convoy to the Ukrainian front lines. Sass is an Estonian entrepreneur and cofounder of cloud-based software company Pipedrive, which was valued at more than $1 billion in 2020. He has been operating in Ukraine for more than a decade, and in 2019 launched a startup incubator in Kiev called Lift99. When the war broke out in early 2022, Sass donated $20,000 to the Ukrainian army. “Many people followed, and by the end of day, we collected $200,000,” Sass says. By March 2022, Sass had organized his first convoy of 14 cars, and by June of that year, he joined with NAFO. Sass’ operation incentivizes donations by offering a patch to anyone who donates more than €100 ($110), and he says to date they have sent out more than 10,000 patches to donors in more than 50 countries. The NAFO fundraisers are needed, Sass says, because of the glacial pace that organizations like NATO operate in response to wartime situations. “We are the fastest and most effective,” Sass says. “We can fundraise and deliver help in a matter of days. Like we did with Kursk: We started a campaign on Thursday evening. Next week, car and drones were handed over to units in Kursk. This war will be won by drones, and NATO procurement is from the stone age.” Recently, British lawmaker David Taylor joined Sass on one of his delivery missions. “You are doing incredible work and I was proud to have joined you,” Taylor wrote in response to a post by the 69th Sniffing Brigade on X. Taylor is far from the only high-profile figure who has publicly thanked NAFO for their efforts. “A massive shoutout to the incredible NAFO Fellas for your unwavering support of Ukraine,” Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the president of Ukraine, wrote on X earlier this month. “Your ongoing fight for truth and against disinformation is of immense importance.” General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the Ukraine ambassador to the UK and former commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, has a NAFO patch. US congressman Adam Kinzinger is a NAFO member, and Mark Rutte, the secretary general of NATO, was recently presented with his very own framed Shibu Inu cartoon dog. Ukrainian troops also regularly share their thanks to NAFO donors on social media, posting pictures of the vehicles or weapons funded by the group and how they were used in combating Russia. “While carrying out some special tasks, I came across a vehicle that helps partially destroy Russian UAV every day,” Bohdan Patel, a 21-year-old Ukrainian soldier, posted on X alongside a picture of a truck with a NAFO patch emblazoned on the side. “Thank you to the NAFO community for the support, it is priceless.” In your inbox: A new series of tips for how to use AI every day Meet the masked vigilante tracking down billions in crypto scams Deep dive: This app set out to fight pesticides.

A new Mayan city, lost in the dense jungle of southern Mexico for centuries, has been discovered from the computer of a PhD student hundreds of miles away. This is the story of how he did it. The settlement, named Valeriana after a nearby freshwater lagoon, has all the characteristics of a classic Maya political capital: enclosed plazas, pyramids, a ball court, a reservoir, and an architectural layout that suggests a foundation prior to 150 AD, according to a newly published study in the journal Antiquity. And how did Tulane University graduate student Luke Auld-Thomas find it? The answer lies in lasers. Until recently, archaeology was limited to what a researcher could observe from the ground and with their eyes. However, the technology of detecting and measuring distances with light, known as lidar, has revolutionized the field, allowing us to scan entire regions in search of archaeological sites hidden under dense vegetation or concrete. Let's travel back in time. It is 1848 and the governor of Petén, Guatemala, Modesto Méndez, together with Ambrosio Tut, an artist and chronicler of the time, rediscovered Tikal, one of the most majestic archaeological sites of the Mayan civilization. In the middle of the 19th century, little was known about this advanced culture—which calculated lunar, solar, and Venusian cycles, and invented hieroglyphic writing and the concept of the number zero with hardly any tools. The dense rainforest surrounding Tikal and its lack of roads made it extremely difficult to reach the remains. But the Guatemalan government went deep into the heart of the Petén jungle anyway, in search of its cultural heritage. Guided by the rumors of the locals, machete in hand, along with tape measure and compass, they entered the Petén jungle on an almost impossible mission. Arriving at the Tikal site, Méndez and his team were amazed at what they saw: gigantic temples and pyramids, mostly covered by the jungle. The most imposing constructions, hidden by nature, towered above the tree canopy. Tikal, although partially buried, retained its majesty and gave clues to the enormous size of the city. History repeated itself in 2024—but with some important variations. Rather than a machete, Auld-Thomas armed himself with a search engine. WIRED spoke this week with him and Marcello Canuto, director of Tulane's Middle American Research Institute, about the discovery. Anna Lagos: How did you come across Valeriana by accident? What initially caught your attention in the lidar data? Luke Auld-Thomas: It was both deliberate and accidental. The mapping project was undertaken in 2013 by a group of ecologists who were mapping the distribution of above-ground frest biomass in Mexico. So they basically wanted to say how much carbon is in Mexico's forests and how it is distributed. Lidar is very good at mapping trees in addition to mapping ground. And so they undertook a really large survey throughout Mexico and published their data in 2014 and then made the data available and it just kind of sat there. Nobody was seeming to do very much with it. It was on the digital equivalent of a high, dusty shelf: out of sight and out of mind. I read some research published by some colleagues working in Mexico that had analyzed another data set collected by NASA, also focused on environmental science questions. They've looked at it for archeological purposes and said hey, this seems like a really interesting sample from a methodological standpoint. And I thought, well that's kind of cool. I wonder if there's more of this kind of thing out there. So I just started poking around on the internet and eventually got the right combination of search terms and number of Google pages results in and found this data set. As soon as I opened it up I was delighted, surprised, and amazed that the area they had mapped with absolutely no interest in finding archaeological sites at all was really archaeologically important. And one of their survey blocks which was intended to map trees had actually mapped trees growing on top of a really large Maya city that was previously unknown to the scientific community. And it's like a 15 minute walk off the highway. Could you explain how these lidar data sets were repurposed for archaeology? Auld-Thomas: The main difference between the way that ecologists use lidar and the way that archaeologists use it is that ecologists are interested in everything that's happening above ground level. For archaeologists, it's the inverse. The first thing we do is digitally select and delete all of the vegetation to look at the ground in an archaeological context, which usually involves ruined buildings that have fallen over and become mounded through time. We enlisted a colleague at the University of Houston who specializes in collecting and processing lidar data for archaeologists, and had him use his algorithms that have been tuned over a period of more than a decade for squeezing out every last bit of terrain detail. These algorithms are based on slope thresholds, where you set a threshold for what is likely to be a natural slope and what's likely to be artificial, like the edge of a building. Because Maya architecture in this part of the world is so well-preserved and the buildings are so steep, the original out-of-the-box ground-detecting algorithm had sheared off the tops of all the buildings assuming that they were buildings. That was one reason reprocessing this data proved really valuable: It allowed us to capture all of the architectural detail that was otherwise so well-preserved that the scan was ignoring it. Is it surprising to you that such a large city has not been discovered before? Why do you think it remained hidden for so long? Auld-Thomas: It was very surprising. I think it goes to show that cities like this are not actually rare in the Maya region; large dense cities with monumental architecture and lots of residential buildings all around them are commonplace. I wanted to ask you also about the impact of climate change on the disappearance of Valeriana. What role do you think climate change played in the collapse of the Maya cities? Marcello Canuto: Generally speaking, the archaeological community agrees that climate change played a role in the collapse of Maya civilization in the Classic Lowlands. However, it was not a total disappearance. The Maya culture survived, and today many people continue to speak Mayan languages and practice their traditions. What happened was a political and demographic collapse, not a cultural one. Auld-Thomas: Yes, and the interesting thing is that densely populated cities, like Valeriana, were more exposed to climate change. When the whole landscape is full of settlements, there is less flexibility for people to move to new areas in times of drought or crisis. Densely populated societies are more vulnerable to these changes. How do you see the balance between development and preservation of archaeological heritage in the region? Canuto: There will always be debates about how to balance development and conservation of cultural heritage. In Mexico, the law states that cultural heritage belongs to the people, and it is INAH's responsibility to manage and preserve it. Having more detailed archaeological data definitely helps to have a more informed discussion about how and where to develop. Auld-Thomas: It's a discussion that every country should have, about how to manage their cultural legacy and enable development. For us, as foreign archaeologists, we always follow the laws of the country and respect the decisions of the local authorities. Do you have plans to visit Valerian soon? Auld-Thomas: Yes. Although my current work is more focused on remote sensing and not so much on field excavations, I'm excited about what we'll discover when we visit Valeriana in person. Canuto: That's right. We are in talks to visit the site with the INAH team to see up close what the lidar has revealed. Although we have not yet fully defined our next steps, I think the potential for further research in this area is enormous. With so many technological advances such as lidar and artificial intelligence, how do you see the future of archaeology? What are your prospects for future discoveries? Auld-Thomas: I hope this research inspires archaeologists around the world to start working with found or repurposed data sets that have been collected and are sitting around gathering dust. I think the Maya world is the tip of the iceberg in that sense, and there's a lot more to be found globally. The other thing I'll add is that sensor development is happening really rapidly, and the quality of lidar data is improving, as is the scale at which it can be collected efficiently. I think it's only a short matter of time before new kinds of sensors are able to map much larger areas very quickly. We're rapidly approaching the era where these small windows we've been afforded by available technology are going to be blown open like the Kool-Aid man crashing through them. Canuto: Yes, and another important aspect is access to digital data. I think in the long term this should be an open science exercise. The only reason we were able to do this study was because somebody decided to make this data available. You also have to think about the risks, such as misuse of the data, but science advances when researchers have access to the information and can analyze it from different perspectives. In Mexico, for example, INAH has made a lot of lidar data available to the public, which has led to incredible discoveries. Auld-Thomas: I remember 20 years ago, I was reading a story about an Egyptologist who looked in Google Earth and found a sight. I remember thinking to myself, \"Oh, lucky Egyptologists, they can just look at Google Earth and discover archaeological sites.\" In the Maya region, we'll never be able to do that because there are so many trees everywhere. But with lidar, that is changing. We are starting to have the ability to analyze large areas, share that data and allow other researchers to study it. These maps are there for everyone to look at.

            "content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Humans have been trying to talk to animals ever since we figured out how to form words. In modern times, we turn to technology for the solution—giving our dogs talking buttons to paw at, or trying to use artificial intelligence to help us understand whales. The latest and perhaps most direct approach at human-animal communication is a voice-activated collar that gives your pet the power to talk back to you. Or at least, that’s the idea. John McHale, a self-described “tech guy” based out of Austin, Texas, has a company called Personifi AI. The startup’s goal, as the name implies, is to create tech that will “personify everything,” as McHale puts it. The first step, for now, is pets. The company’s collar has a speaker on it; talk to your pet (or, really, talk to the collar) and you’ll hear a prerecorded human voice responding to you, creating the illusion that your pet has a humanlike personality and the ability to speak English. The collar is just for cats and dogs now, but McHale hopes to get into wearable devices for other critters and, eventually, humans. McHale got the idea for the talking collar after his dog, Roscoe, got bit by a rattlesnake. McHale didn’t realize what had happened at first, until hours later when Roscoe started seeming very unwell. Don’t worry, Roscoe lived and is doing just fine now, but he did have to spend 10 days in the animal hospital, a stay which presumably racked up a large veterinary bill. That harrowing close call stuck with McHale, and he wondered how things might have gone differently. Could he have helped Roscoe sooner if the dog had just been able to tell him what happened? Thus, the idea of Shazam was born. Oh yeah, the collar is called Shazam, though it has no relation to either the superhero movies or the very well known music discovery service of the same name. Shazam (for pets) has both a microphone and voice box inside, allowing it to hear your voice and respond with one of its own. The idea is to make owners feel like they’re having conversations with their pet when really, they’re talking to a chatbot on the collar. “We start with states of being,” McHale says. “We measure all sorts of things about the human, about the pet, and about the world. And all those variables are essentially ongoing and changing and are inputs to what we call the cognitive cortex, which we build, which is based on machine learning and large data sets.” That sort of world-building for your pet won’t come cheap. The collars start at $495 for cats and $595 for dogs. There are also subscription fees—$195 a year for the feline and “ultra” collars, or $295 a year for the BrainBoost service, which a rep for Shazam says is “what brings all of the truly sentient qualities such as empathy, reasoning, social awareness, and self awareness.” Both of those subscription fees are waived for the first year but will automatically renew after a year. Without the BrainBoost subscription, the band falls back to a generic voice and loses its dynamic qualities, so if you want the best experience, you have to keep paying the $295 yearly fee after the first (free) year ends. The collars are available for preorder now, but the company says shipping won’t start until February 2025. (Add this one to the list of AI-powered wearable devices that you can pay for now but can’t get until next year, along with gadgets like the AI Friend necklace.) Beyond seemingly giving your fur baby the power of speech, Shazam for pets has other, more practical uses, namely an array of safety features any pet owner would likely be grateful to have. The collar’s microphone and sensors can detect rattlesnakes by listening for the sound of a rattle, or detect if a pet goes missing or is kidnapped. If something like that goes wrong with your pet, you get an alert or a text right away. The collar can also keep track of routines, like picking up the sounds of your dog eating food at certain times of day. It can use that to detect if your pet hasn’t been fed that morning and trigger the voice bot to say something to remind you about it. You will, of course, also have to put aside the very valid privacy concerns that come with your pet running around with an always-on microphone on its collar. But the safety and well-being features are a solid reason to equip your pet with an intelligent collar. But Personifi’s big sell here is the chatbots. Chatbot is perhaps not quite the right term. But rather than using a synthesized voice created with an AI like from the service Eleven Labs, all of Shazam’s voice lines will be prerecorded. There are 27 characters to choose from, each with its own personality and each played by a human voice actor. You select one for your pet when you set up the collar, and if you want to change it to one of the other characters later, that will cost $99. Personifi says each character voice has about 8,000 lines of dialog, with plans to add more as needed. That's a lot of dialog, sure, but what it means is that Shazam's pet voices work more like what you'd hear from a video game NPC than a dynamic, evolving chatbot. McHale says vocal synthesization will likely come to the platform eventually, so that the collar can do things like make comments about the score of a football game as you watch it on TV. The voices are all very Dr. Dolittle; they speak in quippy phrases and crack jokes. Personas range from silly and cutesy to annoying and bewildering. Oddly, all the available characters are identified by illustrations of human avatars on the website. Personas include characters like Bella, which Shazam depicts as a little girl and describes with tags like “cuddler,” “sweet,” and “silly.” Or there is Dr. Gates, a smiling male scientist in a lab coat with the tags “loves kids,” “Nobel prize,” and “pediatric cancer.” You know, classic pet personalities. McHale says the personas were crafted to offer variety but also align with common personality types people tend to associate with their pets. “We've really surveyed the market,” McHale says. “Almost everybody has an idea as to what the personality is of their pet. It's uncanny.” You can further customize these personalities in the app. An array of settings will allow you to change how much of a chatterbox your pet is and dial down the humor settings. The settings also allow you to take your pet to great existential depths. You can select your pet’s values, like compassion, justice, and courage. There are settings for its religious beliefs, power of forgiveness, or thoughts on freedom, fate, and destiny. You can give it a take on politics and broad topics like globalism. It is a truly dizzying amount of customization, yet it’s not really clear how much these settings will change what your pet says when it is begging you to let it go outside and take a dump. McHale showed me a demo of the Shazam collar over a Zoom call. Roscoe—chocolate lab, rattlesnake bite survivor, and a very good boy indeed—wears the collar while in a room with McHale and a few other people from Personifi. One of Roscoe’s handlers holds out treats and speaks to him, and the collar answers in the voice of voiceover artist Bobby Johnson, aka The RxckStxr. “Roscoe, how are you feeling?” the handler asks. “Like I could drink a whole gallon of water,” Roscoe’s collar responds. “Oh, that's why you don't want to go chase squirrels, buddy. You haven't been getting water all day. Shame on us. I still love you, though, Roscoe.” Roscoe says, “Let's go for a walk and you can tell me all about how much you love me.” It’s fun, but what Roscoe says doesn’t exactly match with what he’s doing. To me, it feels like Roscoe doesn’t care all that much about getting water. Instead, he focused intently on the treats in the room. If he could actually vocalize his thoughts in that moment, he might have instead said something like, “I see you have a treat. Please give me that treat now.” Some scenarios work better than others. In another example, they play tug-of-war with Roscoe. The collar’s sensors can discern that some play activity is happening, and Roscoe’s zany “voice” says, “You might as well cancel all your plans, because I could do this all day!” It follows up with some grunting and growling noises. The collar’s library of canned dialog may be able to approximate the simple, oversize personalities of most dogs. Cats, the other target audience here, are another matter entirely. The conversations you’d need to have to understand your kitten are more complicated. Daniel “DQ” Quagliozzi is a feline training and behavior specialist who runs Go Cat Go, a cat consultation service in San Francisco. He says people often misunderstand what cats actually want. And a talking collar isn’t likely to help bridge that miscommunication, if the cat is even willing to wear the thing at all. “Realistically,” Quagliozzi says, “that collar would just be saying ‘get this fucking collar off me’ all the time.” It’s hard enough to get a straight answer out of your pet, but appending them with a voice box that approximates what experiences a sensor-laden collar thinks they’re going through may not be the most efficient way of figuring them out. You’ve probably seen the viral Instagram posts where people film their pups pressing buttons that trigger specific phrases. The proposition there is that the animals are learning how to communicate with their owners. In reality, rather than actually understanding what the individual button means, the pets are probably just tapping the ones that produce the biggest reaction (or guaranteed treats) from their owner. Shazam for pets runs into a similar problem. Pets don’t understand much of human language, in the same way we don’t always understand what they’re barking on about. “The real benefit of the bond is to the human,” McHale says. “This is all about the human being—even the well-being pieces that we've built into this. The humans now feel, you know, their pet is safer and better understood.” The best chatbots, even the ones powered by LLMs, still don’t actually understand what you’re saying. They’re just very good at generating responses that make you feel like they really get you. When you use that mimicry to give voice to another living creature, your pet doesn’t understand what any of it means either. The pet will hear the same voice you do, but it won’t interpret it as its own voice, speaking its own intentions. It will hear it speaking as a separate entity entirely, just closer to its ears than usual. McHale envisions a world where dogs wearing Shazam collars meet at the dog park. They would sniff and bark at one another, all while a couple of human-voiced chatbots are gabbing on around their necks. Quagliozzi, on the other hand, worries about the darker side of the gimmick of giving pets a voice. He fears it may lead to a rise of social media videos that people think are innocuous but are potentially harmful to their cats. “That’s one of the things I battle against constantly is people using their cats as props or funny things,” Quagliozzi says. “Scaring their cats or just curating comedy based on how they know a cat will react to something traumatic. Giving them a funny cartoon voice or whatever, I could see that going off the rails.” The features of the Shazam collar that provide awareness for the owner, particularly the ones that focus on the safety and well-being of that pet, are commendable. Detecting a rattlesnake strike could be a lifesaver. And if it takes a dog tossing out a sassy “Hey pal, it’s kibble time!” to remind their owner to feed them, then so be it. But putting a chatbot on your dog’s collar probably won’t deepen your ties. The urge to understand your pet is natural. But there are better ways to make sure their needs are met than making them speak your language. The best conversation you’re going to have with your pet is not by getting it to spit sassy wisecracks at you, it’s to meet them at their level. “We’re just trying to always dial it up, just a little bit,” Quagliozzi says. “The same way we want robots, the same way we want AI companions, all these things. Inherently, human beings are lonely, and we want connection.” In your inbox: Upgrade your life with WIRED-tested gear A bitcoin mining dream turned into a nightmare The Big Story: An oral history of WIRED’s original website I made a wholesome OnlyFans to try to make ends meet Event: Join us for WIRED Health on March 18 in London Dyson Owner Rewards - 20% Off Dyson Promo Code Get up to $750 Trade in Credit on the Galaxy S24 Ultra Newegg Promo Code - 50% off Select Products Peacock Student Discount For $1.99/Mo For 12 Months Get The New DJI Mini 4 Pro From $759 For A Limited Time Up To $20 Off/Month Student Discount More From WIRED Reviews and Guides © 2024 Condé Nast.

            "content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. When investors poured $6.6 billion into OpenAI last week, they seemed largely unbothered by the latest drama, which recently saw the company’s chief technology officer, Mira Murati, along with chief research officer Bob McCrew and Barret Zoph, a vice president of research, abruptly quit. And yet those three departures were just the latest in an ongoing exodus of key technical talent. Over the past few years, OpenAI has lost several researchers who played crucial roles in developing the algorithms, techniques, and infrastructure that helped make it the world leader in AI as well as a household name. Several other ex-OpenAI employees who spoke to WIRED said that an ongoing shift to a more commercial focus continues to be a source of friction. “People who like to do research are being forced to do product,” says one former employee who works at a rival AI company but has friends at OpenAI. This person says some of their contacts at the firm have reached out in recent weeks to inquire about jobs. OpenAI itself has also seemingly shifted in its hiring priorities, according to data compiled for WIRED by Lightcast, a company that tracks job postings to analyze labor trends. In 2021, 23 percent of its job postings were for general research roles. In 2024 general research accounted for just 4.4 percent of job postings. The brain drain could have lasting implications for OpenAI’s direction and future success. Experts and former employees say the company still has a deep bench of talent, but competition is intensifying, making it more challenging to maintain an edge. The latest big-name departure, revealed on Thursday, is that of Tim Brooks, head of OpenAI’s Sora AI video generation project. Brooks posted on X that he would join one of OpenAI’s main rivals, Google DeepMind. “It could start to change things,” says a former OpenAI staff member, who now works in academia, of the losses. They asked to remain anonymous out of concern for harming collaborative relationships with the AI industry. For now, this person says, many students still put OpenAI at the top of their list of potential employers. It is seen as several months ahead of the competition, and prospective employees are often willing to put up with the apparent drama and infighting to be part of that. But applicants are also often drawn to working with a particular researcher or team, and their calculations could change as more big-name researchers leave for rival AI companies or their own startups. A look at some of OpenAI’s most important research shows how much talent has departed. Of 31 people listed as authors of an early version of OpenAI’s GPT large language model, fewer than half remain at OpenAI, according to employment details sourced from LinkedIn or other public social media profiles. Several members of the team responsible for developing GPT left OpenAI in 2021 to form Anthropic, now a major rival. Roughly a third of those listed in the acknowledgements for a technical blog post describing ChatGPT have since left. A key question is whether OpenAI has a deep enough bench of AI researchers that it can continue to be first to key advances in AI, essential for justifying its skyrocketing valuation. OpenAI aims to increase its revenues to $100 billion per year by 2029, according to a report in The New York Times that cites a document shared with prospective investors. The company expects ChatGPT to bring in $2.7 billion in revenue this year, up from $700 million in 2023, with a further $1 billion coming from other sources. Competition is also intensifying, with Google and others throwing huge resources behind competing AI offerings. The social media giant Meta offers free AI models and tools that are often as good as those provided by for-profit players. Some of the biggest shoes for OpenAI to fill are those of Ilya Sutskever, a cofounder and the technical visionary for much of the company’s early work. Sutskever departed in May to found a new AI company of his own called Safe Superintelligence. Sutskever did pioneering work on deep learning and was an early believer that scaling up the amount of compute used to build models would yield increasingly capable AI—a prediction that proved remarkably prescient. He also crucially realized that a neural network architecture developed by Google researchers known as the transformer could prove key to improving AI’s language skills. Sutskever was also a member of the board that briefly ousted CEO Sam Altman in November 2023, although he apologized and called for Altman to be reinstated a few days later. The episode seemingly stirred up internal conflict over Altman’s control of the company, its commercial focus, and appetite for risk. Murati was often caught in the center of internal conflict, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, including tensions over the hastiness with which the company’s voice interface was released. Sutskevar’s departure was swiftly followed by that of Jan Leike, who co-led a team dedicated to managing the long-term risks of AI. In August John Schulman, another OpenAI cofounder and a highly respected research scientist, also announced that he was leaving. Schulman worked on, among other things, techniques for fine-tuning large language models with human feedback using what’s known as reinforcement learning, an approach that proved key to building a capable and garrulous chatbot like ChatGPT. Another big name to leave this year was Andrej Kaparthy, a cofounder who rejoined the company in 2022 after a stint as director of AI at Tesla. Kaparthy left in February of 2024 to found Eureka Labs, an education AI startup. Another early OpenAI employee, who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss the matter by their current employer, says these departures are significant because of how important the research work produced by the individuals has been to OpenAI. However, this person notes that OpenAI still has a number of extremely talented young researchers—and can also offer huge sums of money to potential recruits thanks to its soaring valuation. OpenAI’s latest round of investment comes as the company works to turn itself into a for-profit company. The original founders included Elon Musk, who provided $45 million in early funding. After Musk parted ways with the company, Altman turned it into a capped for-profit enterprise overseen by a board of directors that does not answer to investors. Last November’s attempted coup proved this structure to be in direct conflict with a fast-growing, heavily backed technology business. One former OpenAI staffer, who similarly asked to remain anonymous, confirmed that the product focus continued to cause tension, and said they had been told by current staff to expect more turmoil at the company. Other ex-staffers say the picture inside the company is complex. “The mood is bleak for some and not for others,” one person said. When asked about the situation, OpenAI referred WIRED to a message that Altman sent to staff after the departures of Murati, McGrew, and Zoph, which he also shared on X. In the note Altman names several researchers who will step into more senior roles, including Mark Chen, who will become a senior vice president of research, and Jakub Pachocki, who becomes the company’s chief scientist. “Leadership changes are a natural part of companies, especially companies that grow so quickly and are so demanding,” Altman wrote. “I obviously won’t pretend it’s natural for this one to be so abrupt, but we are not a normal company.” “If you think that a few individuals have some special sauce, and that has just walked out the door, then that's a problem,” says Simon Johnson, a professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management. However, Johnson says that OpenAI’s loss may well turn out to be a gain for the rest of the tech industry. “I think we need a lot more competition in AI; we need a lot more business models; and we need a lot more smart people coming up with constructive things,” he adds. “So I'm very comfortable with the people leaving.” When OpenAI’s board ousted CEO Sam Altman last November, staff threatened to quit in protest, and many shared the slogan “OpenAI is nothing without its people” on X. The company seems determined to test how replaceable some of its key people really are.

            "content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Thousands of machines running Linux have been infected by a malware strain that’s notable for its stealth, the number of misconfigurations it can exploit, and the breadth of malicious activities it can perform, researchers reported Thursday. The malware has been circulating since at least 2021. It gets installed by exploiting more than 20,000 common misconfigurations, a capability that may make millions of machines connected to the internet potential targets, researchers from Aqua Security said. It can also exploit CVE-2023-33426, a vulnerability with a severity rating of 10 out of 10 that was patched last year in Apache RocketMQ, a messaging and streaming platform that’s found on many Linux machines. The researchers are calling the malware Perfctl, the name of a malicious component that surreptitiously mines cryptocurrency. The unknown developers of the malware gave the process a name that combines the perf Linux monitoring tool and ctl, an abbreviation commonly used with command line tools. A signature characteristic of Perfctl is its use of process and file names that are identical or similar to those commonly found in Linux environments. The naming convention is one of the many ways the malware attempts to escape notice of infected users. Perfctl further cloaks itself using a host of other tricks. One is that it installs many of its components as rootkits, a special class of malware that hides its presence from the operating system and administrative tools. Other stealth mechanisms include: The malware is designed to ensure persistence, meaning the ability to remain on the infected machine after reboots or attempts to delete core components. Two such techniques are (1) modifying the ~/.profile script, which sets up the environment during user login so the malware loads ahead of legitimate workloads expected to run on the server and (2) copying itself from memory to multiple disk locations. The hooking of pcap_loop can also provide persistence by allowing malicious activities to continue even after primary payloads are detected and removed. Besides using the machine resources to mine cryptocurrency, Perfctl also turns the machine into a profit-making proxy that paying customers use to relay their internet traffic. Aqua Security researchers have also observed the malware serving as a backdoor to install other families of malware. Assaf Morag, Aqua Security’s threat intelligence director, wrote in an email: Perfctl malware stands out as a significant threat due to its design, which enables it to evade detection while maintaining persistence on infected systems. This combination poses a challenge for defenders and indeed the malware has been linked to a growing number of reports and discussions across various forums, highlighting the distress and frustration of users who find themselves infected. Perfctl uses a rootkit and changes some of the system utilities to hide the activity of the cryptominer and proxy-jacking software. It blends seamlessly into its environment with seemingly legitimate names. Additionally, Perfctl’s architecture enables it to perform a range of malicious activities, from data exfiltration to the deployment of additional payloads. Its versatility means that it can be leveraged for various malicious purposes, making it particularly dangerous for organizations and individuals alike. While Perfctl and some of the malware it installs are detected by some antivirus software, Aqua Security researchers were unable to find any research reports on the malware. They were, however, able to find a wealth of threads on developer-related sites that discussed infections consistent with it. This Reddit comment posted to the CentOS subreddit is typical. An admin noticed that two servers were infected with a cryptocurrency hijacker with the names perfcc and perfctl. The admin wanted help investigating the cause. “I only became aware of the malware because my monitoring setup alerted me to 100% CPU utilization,” the admin wrote in the April 2023 post. “However, the process would stop immediately when I logged in via SSH or console. As soon as I logged out, the malware would resume running within a few seconds or minutes.” The admin continued: I have attempted to remove the malware by following the steps outlined in other forums, but to no avail. The malware always manages to restart once I log out. I have also searched the entire system for the string \"perfcc\" and found the files listed below. However, removing them did not resolve the issue. as it keep respawn on each time rebooted. Other discussions include: Reddit, Stack Overflow (Spanish), forobeta (Spanish), brainycp (Russian), natnetwork (Indonesian), Proxmox (Deutsch), Camel2243 (Chinese), svrforum (Korean), exabytes, virtualmin, serverfault and many others. This story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast. After exploiting a vulnerability or misconfiguration, the exploit code downloads the main payload from a server, which, in most cases, has been hacked by the attacker and converted into a channel for distributing the malware anonymously. An attack that targeted the researchers’ honeypot named the payload httpd. Once executed, the file copies itself from memory to a new location in the /temp directory, runs it, and then terminates the original process and deletes the downloaded binary. Once moved to the /tmp directory, the file executes under a different name, which mimics the name of a known Linux process. The file hosted on the honeypot was named sh. From there, the file establishes a local command-and-control process and attempts to gain root system rights by exploiting CVE-2021-4043, a privilege-escalation vulnerability that was patched in 2021 in Gpac, a widely used open source multimedia framework. The malware goes on to copy itself from memory to a handful of other disk locations, once again using names that appear as routine system files. The malware then drops a rootkit, a host of popular Linux utilities that have been modified to serve as rootkits, and the miner. In some cases, the malware also installs software for “proxy-jacking,” the term for surreptitiously routing traffic through the infected machine so the true origin of the data isn’t revealed. The researchers continued: As part of its command-and-control operation, the malware opens a Unix socket, creates two directories under the /tmp directory, and stores data there that influences its operation. This data includes host events, locations of the copies of itself, process names, communication logs, tokens, and additional log information. Additionally, the malware uses environment variables to store data that further affects its execution and behavior. All the binaries are packed, stripped, and encrypted, indicating significant efforts to bypass defense mechanisms and hinder reverse engineering attempts. The malware also uses advanced evasion techniques, such as suspending its activity when it detects a new user in the btmp or utmp files and terminating any competing malware to maintain control over the infected system. By extrapolating data such as the number of Linux servers connected to the internet across various services and applications, as tracked by services such as Shodan and Censys, the researchers estimate that the number of machines infected by Perfctl is measured in the thousands. They say that the pool of vulnerable machines—meaning those that have yet to install the patch for CVE-2023-33426 or contain a vulnerable misconfiguration—is in the millions. The researchers have yet to measure the amount of cryptocurrency the malicious miners have generated. People who want to determine if their device has been targeted or infected by Perfctl should look for indicators of compromise included in Thursday’s post. They should also be on the lookout for unusual spikes in CPU usage or sudden system slowdowns, particularly if they occur during idle times. Thursday’s report also provides steps for preventing infections in the first place. This story originally appeared on Ars Technica.

            "content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. As digital scamming explodes in Southeast Asia, including so called “pig butchering” investment scams, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) issued a comprehensive report this week with a dire warning about the rapid growth of this criminal ecosystem. Many digital scams have traditionally relied on social engineering, or tricking victims into giving away their money willingly, rather than leaning on malware or other highly technical methods. But researchers have increasingly sounded the alarm that scammers are incorporating generative AI content and deepfakes to expand the scale and effectiveness of their operations. And the UN report offers the clearest evidence yet that these high tech tools are turning an already urgent situation into a crisis. In addition to buying written scripts to use with potential victims or relying on templates for malicious websites, attackers have increasingly been leaning on generative AI platforms to create communication content in multiple languages and deepfake generators that can create photos or even video of nonexistent people to show victims and enhance verisimilitude. Scammers have also been expanding their use of tools that can drain a victim’s cryptocurrency wallets, have been manipulating transaction records to trick targets into sending cryptocurrency to the wrong places, and are compromising smart contracts to steal cryptocurrency. And in some cases, they’ve been purchasing Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite internet systems to help power their efforts. “Agile criminal networks are integrating these new technologies faster than anticipated, driven by new online marketplaces and service providers which have supercharged the illicit service economy,” John Wojcik, a UNODC regional analyst, tells WIRED. “These developments have not only expanded the scope and efficiency of cyber-enabled fraud and cybercrime, but they have also lowered the barriers to entry for criminal networks that previously lacked the technical skills to exploit more sophisticated and profitable methods.” For years, China-linked criminals have trafficked people into gigantic compounds in Southeast Asia, where they are often forced to run scams, held against their will, and beaten if they refuse instructions. Around 200,000 people, from at least 60 countries, have been trafficked to compounds largely in Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos over the last five years. However, as WIRED reporting has shown, these operations are spreading globally—with scamming infrastructure emerging in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and West Africa. Most prominently, these organized crime operations have run pig butchering scams, where they build intimate relationships with victims before introducing an “investment opportunity” and asking for money. Criminal organizations may have conned people out of around $75 billion through pig butchering scams. Aside from pig butchering, according to the UN report, criminals across Southeast Asia are also running job scams, law enforcement impersonation, asset recovery scams, virtual kidnappings, sextortion, loan scams, business email compromise, and other illicit schemes. Criminal networks in the region earned up to $37 billion last year, UN officials estimate. Perhaps unsurprisingly, all of this revenue is allowing scammers to expand their operations and diversify, incorporating new infrastructure and technology into their systems in the hope of making them more efficient and brutally effective. For example, scammers are often constrained by their language skills and ability to keep up conversations with potentially hundreds of victims at a time in numerous languages and dialects. However, generative AI developments within the last two years—including the launch of writing tools such as ChatGPT—are making it easier for criminals to break down language barriers and create the content needed for scamming. The UN’s report says AI can be used for automating phishing attacks that ensnare victims, the creation of fake identities and online profiles, and the crafting of personalized scripts to trick victims while messaging them in different languages. “These developments have not only expanded the scope and efficiency of cyber-enabled fraud and cybercrime, but they have also lowered the barriers to entry for criminal networks that previously lacked the technical skills to exploit sophisticated and profitable methods,” the report says. Stephanie Baroud, a criminal intelligence analyst in Interpol’s human trafficking unit, says the impact of AI needs to be considered as part of a pig butchering scammer’s tactics going forward. Baroud, who spoke with WIRED in an interview before the publication of the UN report, says the criminal’s recruitment ads that lure people into being trafficked to scamming compounds used to be “very generic” and full of grammatical errors. However, AI is now making them appear more polished and compelling, Baroud says. “It is really making it easier to create a very realistic job offer,” she says. “Unfortunately, this will make it much more difficult to identify which is the real and which is the fake ads.” Perhaps the biggest AI paradigm shift in such digital attacks comes from deepfakes. Scammers are increasingly using machine-learning systems to allow for real-time face-swapping. This technology, which has also been used by romance scammers in West Africa, allows criminals to change their appearance on calls with their victims, making them realistically appear to be a different person. The technology is allowing “one-click” face swaps and high-resolution video feeds, the UN’s report states. Such services are a game changer for scammers, because they allow attackers to “prove” to victims in photos or real-time video calls that they are who they claim to be. Using these setups, however, can require stable internet connections, which can be harder to maintain within some regions where pig butchering compounds and other scamming have flourished. There has been a “notable” increase in cops seizing Starlink satellite dishes in recent months in Southeast Asia, the UN says—80 units were seized between April and June this year. In one such operation carried out in June, Thai police confiscated 58 Starlink devices. In another instance, law enforcement seized 10 Starlink devices and 4,998 preregistered SIM cards while criminals were in the process of moving their operations from Myanmar to Laos. Starlink did not immediately respond to WIRED’s request for comment. “Obviously using real people has been working for them very well, but using the tech could be cheaper after they have the required computers” and connectivity, says Troy Gochenour, a volunteer with the Global Anti-Scam Organization (GASO), a US-based nonprofit that fights human-trafficking and cybercrime operations in Southeast Asia. Gochenour’s research involves tracking trends on Chinese-language Telegram channels related to carrying out pig butchering scams. And he says that it is increasingly common to see people applying to be AI models for scam content. In addition to AI services, attackers have increasingly leaned on other technical solutions as well. One tool that has been increasingly common in digital scamming is so-called “crypto drainers,” a type of malware that has particularly been deployed against victims in Southeast Asia. Drainers can be more or less technically sophisticated, but their common goal is to “drain” funds from a target’s cryptocurrency wallets and redirect the currency to wallets controlled by attackers. Rather than stealing the credentials to access the target wallet directly, drainers are typically designed to look like a legitimate service—either by impersonating an actual platform or creating a plausible brand. Once a victim has been tricked into connecting their wallet to the drainer, they are then manipulated into approving one or a few transactions that grant attackers unintended access to all the funds in the wallet. Drainers can be used in many contexts and with many fronts. They can be a component of pig butchering investment scams, or promoted to potential victims through compromised social media accounts, phishing campaigns, and malvertizing. Researchers from the firm ScamSniffer, for example, published findings in December about sponsored social media and search engine ads linked to malicious websites that contained a cryptocurrency drainer. The campaign, which ran from March to December 2023 reportedly stole about $59 million from more than 63,000 victims around the world. Far from the low-tech days of doing everything through social engineering by building a rapport with potential victims and crafting tricky emails and text messages, today’s scammers are taking a hybrid approach to make their operations as efficient and lucrative as possible, UN researchers say. And even if they aren’t developing sophisticated malware themselves in most cases, scammers are increasingly in the market to use these malicious tools, prompting malware authors to adapt or create hacking tools for scams like pig butchering. Researchers say that scammers have been seen using infostealers and even remote access trojans that essentially create a backdoor in a victim’s system that can be utilized in other types of attacks. And scammers are also expanding their use of malicious smart contracts that appear to programmatically establish a certain agreed-upon transaction or set of transactions, but actually does much more. “Infostealer logs and underground data markets have also been critical to ongoing market expansion, with access to unprecedented amounts of sensitive data serving as a major catalyst,” Wojcik, from the UNODC, says. The changing tactics are significant as global law enforcement scrambles to deter digital scamming. But they are just one piece of the larger picture, which is increasingly urgent and bleak for forced laborers and victims of these crimes. “It is now increasingly clear that a potentially irreversible displacement and spillover has taken place in which organized crime are able to pick, choose, and move value and jurisdictions as needed, with the resulting situation rapidly outpacing the capacity of governments to contain it,” UN officials wrote in the report. “Failure to address this ecosystem will have consequences for Southeast Asia and other regions.” In your inbox: A new series of tips for how to use AI every day Meet the masked vigilante tracking down billions in crypto scams Deep dive: This app set out to fight pesticides.

To make the perfect scoop of ice cream, you first need a dairy base—its natural proteins, fat, and sugar provide the rich, distinct mouthfeel. Heavy cream is added, further smoothing the texture. The introduction of sugar isn’t just for sweetness: Like scattering salt on snow, it lowers the freezing point, minimizing ice formation. Flavoring can now be brought to the mix, from the quintessential (chocolate chips or vanilla pods) to the more daring (spices, salt, or booze). This recipe takes you just under halfway to the ideal dollop. Next is the 0.5 percent of emulsifiers and stabilizers added to the liquid, helping the water content and fats stick together. The mix is homogenized, then cooled and aged for 24 hours at 5 degrees Celsius (40 Fahrenheit), for an even richer, smoother taste before it’s frozen. The cooling system inside a continuous freezer, where the ice cream is scraped inside a large cylinder. Then comes the secret ingredient. “We sell air,” says Elsebeth Baungaard Andersen, product manager at Swedish multinational food packaging and processing company Tetra Pak. “Half the volume of your favorite tub of ice cream is air. But it’s those air bubbles and whipped texture that provide the special mouthfeel as it melts in your mouth, releasing the delicious flavor.” At Tetra Pak’s Product Development Center in Aarhus, Denmark—a lab for the biggest and smallest ice-cream brands to test and taste their latest experiments—air is a precious, invisible commodity. During the freezing stage, in which the mix is cooled to -5 degrees Celsius (23 Fahrenheit) inside a rotating cylinder, the dasher’s scraper knives not only scoop out frozen batches of the good stuff, they also whip in air. Stabilized by fat globules and proteins, air bubbles create that soft, familiar, luxurious feel. “We have to be so precise with our dosing,” says Baungaard. “Ice cream is a science: Too much air and it’s frothy; too little air and it’s hard to scoop and eat.” The perfect scoop, step-by-step: The exact dosage depends on the recipe: The lower the overrun—that is, the percentage by which the air increases the mixture’s volume—the more premium the product. An artisanal gelato has a denser texture—its overrun may be just 20 percent. Budget supermarket ice-cream may have an overrun even exceeding 100 percent. This is just some of the complex chemistry involved in making the world’s favorite dessert. Tetra Pak may be more famous for its packaging, but it takes a sizable scoop of the estimated $113 billion ice cream industry: Each of its continuous freezers pumps out 4,000 liters every hour, typically for small producers looking to scale. Besides tubs, its production lines churn out 2 million ice-cream sticks every day. Major clients also use its Aarhus facility to trial new concepts. (“We’re in the Silicon Valley of ice cream,” says Andersen.) Tetra Pak ice cream engineers have indeed innovated the industry: In the late 1980s, its technology meant ice cream could be extruded on a stick at a cooler temperature, meaning more air bubbles, creating a more premium taste. The product became the Magnum Classic. Today, collaborative robots (or cobots) ensure there’s no generous overfilling of portions on the factory floor—and that each scoop has an equal amount of sauce. Their human colleagues, meanwhile, test new prototypes via 3D printers. A breakthrough in the ice cream industry, says Sampson Anankanbil, ingredients application specialist at Tetra Pak, has been the development of heat-shock-resistant ice cream, ideal for transporting tubs to distribution centers and beyond, particularly in hot climates. Stabilizing solutions create a cryogel, so when ice crystals melt, it mops up excess water—the ice cream melts more slowly, and the eating quality remains. Ice-cream molds are filled, then dunked in cold brine to solidify the contents. The next frontier is about creating a plant-based scoop that’s as good as its dairy counterpart. Lacking the same natural fat, texture, and richness of flavor, it’s the Holy Grail of ice cream. In the name of sustainability, Andersen and Anankanbil believe that “hybrid” ice cream, combining both proteins into a single product, is the future of the industry. Tetra Pak is exploring fava beans (also known as broad beans) as a potential solution. “We don’t want to compromise on indulgence,” says Anankanbil. “But we see that it has a very good profile, flavor, and clean taste compared to other vegan protein sources.” While Tetra Pak has slowed the melting process, it has no interest in eliminating it altogether. That scoop of chocolate gelato in a cone—steadily dripping down your arm on your summer vacation—is going nowhere. “Ice cream is surprisingly complex,” says Anankanbil. “It has air, fat, and ice crystals in a frozen state, then all these ingredients come together in your mouth in an unfrozen state—melting is what releases the flavor.” This article appears in the November/December 2024 issue of WIRED UK magazine.

SpaceX is seeking approval for changes to Starlink that the company says will enable gigabit-per-second broadband service. In an application submitted to the US Federal Communications Commission on October 11, SpaceX claims the requested \"modification and its companion amendment will enable the Gen2 system to deliver gigabit-speed, truly low-latency broadband and ubiquitous mobile connectivity to all Americans and the billions of people globally who still lack access to adequate broadband.\" SpaceX said it is seeking \"several small-but-meaningful updates to the orbital configuration and operational parameters for its Gen2 space station authorization to improve space sustainability, better respond to evolving demand, and more efficiently share spectrum with other spectrum users.\" SpaceX wants to lower the altitudes of satellites \"at 525 km, 530 km, and 535 km to 480 km, 485 km, and 475 km altitude, respectively.\" The reconfiguration will increase the \"potential maximum number of orbital planes and satellites per plane\" while keeping the planned total number of second-generation satellites at 29,988 or less. The FCC has so far approved 7,500 Gen2 satellites. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk wrote Monday that \"next generation Starlink satellites, which are so big that only Starship can launch them, will allow for a 10X increase in bandwidth and, with the reduced altitude, faster latency.\" SpaceX promised gigabit speeds in 2016, when the satellite system was just in the planning stages and didn't even have a name yet. \"Once fully optimized through the Final Deployment, the system will be able to provide high bandwidth (up to 1 Gbps per user), low-latency broadband services for consumers and businesses in the US and globally,\" SpaceX told the FCC in November 2016. As for actual speeds in 2024, Starlink's website says \"users typically experience download speeds between 25 and 220 Mbps, with a majority of users experiencing speeds over 100 Mbps. Upload speeds are typically between 5 and 20 Mbps. Latency ranges between 25 and 60 ms on land, and 100+ ms in certain remote locations.\" Another request would change the elevation angles of satellites to improve network performance, SpaceX said. \"SpaceX seeks to lower its minimum elevation angle from 25 degrees to 20 degrees for satellites operating between 400 and 500 kilometers altitude,\" SpaceX told the FCC. \"Reducing the minimum elevation angle in this way will enhance customer connectivity by allowing satellites to connect to more earth stations directly and to maintain connections with earth stations for a longer period of time while flying overhead.\" This story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast. Meanwhile, upgrades to Starlink's Gen2 satellites \"will feature enhanced hardware that can use higher gain and more advanced beamforming and digital processing technologies and provide more targeted and robust coverage for American consumers,\" SpaceX said. SpaceX is also seeking more flexible use of spectrum licenses to support its planned mobile service and the current home internet service. The company asked for permission \"to use Ka-, V-, and E-band frequencies for either mobile- or fixed-satellite use cases where the US or International Table of Frequency Allocations permits such dual use and where the antenna parameters would be indistinguishable.\" \"These small modifications, which align with Commission precedent, do not involve any changes to the technical parameters of SpaceX's authorization, but would permit significant additional flexibility to meet the diverse connectivity and capacity needs of consumer, enterprise, industrial, and government users,\" the application said. SpaceX said it also submitted \"an amendment to the pending part of the Gen2 application requesting additional upgrades to its Gen2 system that the Commission has not yet addressed, including SpaceX's orbital shells below 400 kilometers and frequencies beyond those requested in the original application.\" There's no guarantee the FCC will approve the requests. Other satellite operators and mobile carriers have objected to previous Starlink plans, and the FCC has been skeptical of some of the company's claims. AT&T and Verizon recently asked the FCC to reject a key part of SpaceX's plan to offer cellular service with T-Mobile. The mobile carriers say a SpaceX-requested waiver of FCC rules on out-of-band emission limits would interfere with and degrade service for terrestrial mobile broadband networks. In March, the FCC denied a SpaceX application to use certain spectrum bands for mobile service. The decision forces SpaceX to seek changes in a rulemaking process in which the FCC would evaluate whether the spectrum bands can handle the system without affecting existing users. The FCC questioned Starlink's capabilities in 2022 when the agency denied an application for $886 million in federal funding that is supposed to be used to expand broadband access. The FCC decided that Starlink may not be able to consistently provide low-latency service with the grant program's required download speeds of 100 Mbps and upload speeds of 20 Mbps. At the time, the FCC called Starlink a \"nascent\" technology with \"recognized capacity constraints\" while pointing to falling speeds and a $600 upfront cost (which has since been lowered). SpaceX and CEO Elon Musk have continued to criticize the FCC for denying the grant. The application for satellite-system changes is a very different matter than the grant. SpaceX's proposed changes might solve some of the capacity and speed problems the FCC previously identified. Other companies will have time to file objections. To obtain approval, SpaceX will have to demonstrate that the changes won't negatively affect other spectrum users and satellite operators. This story originally appeared on Ars Technica.

This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED 6/10 The beauty of coffee stems from the endless ways of personalizing it. But with the number of fancy espresso machines, pour-over sets, French presses, and bottles of cold brew concentrate on the shelves, it can get exhausting to choose your preferred method for your kitchen. One way of thinking about what’s best for your home is to determine if you’re making coffee just for yourself or for a whole family. If you’re a solo dweller who’s looking for a new way to add some excitement to your morning brew routine, there’s an interesting option that's worth considering: the Siphonysta. A siphon brewing system is a pretty obsolete way of preparing coffee. The setup looks like a science experiment. A bulb of coffee grounds is heated with water and then gets sucked through a vacuum into another chamber above it. It can sometimes take up to 20 minutes for a cup to fully brew. Nobody in my contacts is waiting 20 minutes for a single cup of coffee—likely the reason it has fizzled in popularity. But if you have a little time to spare for a good cup of coffee, a siphon is seen as a great brewing method because the vacuum technology is known to enhance the aroma of the coffee. Tiger’s Siphonysta is the first electric siphon machine that reduces that wait time to just about three minutes—instantly catapulting the siphon method into this century. Made in Japan, the Siphonysta may come off as a coffee machine for coffee nerds who like to experiment with making coffee in all sorts of ways. While that is definitely true, I actually consider it to be a great option for any solo coffee maker. If you live alone, perhaps with one other person, and aren’t going to need to make a large amount of coffee each day, then this is a great way to make amazing coffee at home. I tested the Siphonysta using Verve Coffee Roasters’ Miraflores light roast and ground two scoops (the scoop is included with the Siphonysta) of whole beans in a Fellow Ode Brew Grinder Gen 2 on the 7 ⅔ setting. I also compared the taste of the final cup of coffee from the Siphonysta to that of a French press. For the French press, I changed the grinder setting for the beans to a 9. Coffee grounds for a French press are supposed to be a little bigger, so I felt that was a fair adjustment. The Siphonysta is a pretty small machine at about 12 x 9 x 14 inches. It can be a little tricky to get used to. The top and bottom chambers each screw into a round base, which you lock into the machine. I’ve had to twist, turn, and finagle each of the chambers quite a bit to lock them into the base. You also then need to place and twist a dome onto the top chamber. If all of these aren’t done precisely, the machine will not work properly. Once you do it for a few days, you start getting the hang of it, although I still feel that this aspect of the machine should be much more streamlined. The body of the machine, which has a matte black exterior, presents itself as solid and reliable, although the two plastic chambers cause me a little bit of concern with durability, especially considering all of the nuances necessary to maneuver the parts into place. The chambers are made of a plastic that does not seem to be of the highest quality. I feel that if I were to accidentally drop one of them onto the floor, they would crack, instantly making the whole machine nonfunctional. The Siphonsyta works by adding water to the top chamber and the coffee grounds to the bottom chamber, above the filter, which sits in the bottom chamber. The machine comes with a metal stand that you can place the bottom chamber into to keep it steady while you’re pouring the grinds in. You fill the water to the one-cup line or two-cup line, which is barely more than one cup.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED You have three options for how acidic or bitter you want the coffee to be, as well as three options for how light or strong you'd prefer, making a total of nine flavor characteristics settings to choose from. There's an additional Dual Temp setting, which reduces the water temperature halfway through the brewing process. I prefer to choose the more specific controls. To compare with the French press best, I kept each on the medium setting, although I tried the other settings out and they do make a very slight difference that you can taste if you’re really paying attention. The only other buttons are Start and Stop—pretty simple on that front. Once the chambers are locked into place and you twist the base that they’re locked into, the buttons light up and you can press Start. The first time I used the Siphonysta, two of the plugs in the top chamber popped out during the end of the cycle and seemed to cause a lot of trouble when I went back to make another cup. All of the water would leak out through the dispensing spout. I realized there was a larger issue at play, so I got the chamber system replaced. Luckily, the customer service was great and Tiger replaced it immediately. From then on, I had no issues using the machine. It’s fun to watch the brewing process. When everything gets going, water slowly drips from the top chamber into the bottom. It soon starts dripping faster, heats up, and gets the chamber with the coffee grounds all steamy. Since the inner lining of the machine is a reflective metal, you can watch it all take place. Eventually all of the water drips down. Then the vacuum process—the highlight of any siphon system—begins and you can see the coffee zoom from a pipe in the bottom chamber up to the top dome, then rain down against the dome like a fountain. It’s truly a show. Tiger Siphonysta Automated Siphon Coffee Brewing System Rating: 6/10 If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED About three minutes and 15 seconds later, the machine beeps three times, indicating that your coffee is ready. I like that it doesn’t automatically dispense into your cup, but rather, you place the cup underneath the spout and pull the lever when you're ready. I also like the resistance level on the dispensing lever. The bottom plate serves as a removable drip tray. You can dispense however much you want, but again, this doesn’t make that much coffee in one cycle, so you’ll probably dispense it all. If you don’t, the upper chamber does not keep the remaining coffee hot. The company says the plastic parts are dishwasher safe, but I honestly don’t have enough trust in the sturdiness of the chambers to put them in there. I just give them a rinse when I’m done. In terms of the final product, I must say, the Siphonysta produces a fantastic cup of coffee. I like this much better than the coffee from a French press. Comparing the two makes it easy to see how the vacuum technology makes a difference in the taste of the coffee. It’s almost as if it oxidizes it. The individual flavor notes of the coffee stand out more, and there’s just a brighter, bolder taste. However, the price is pretty steep for what you get. If this came from a startup company, I might understand it better. But Tiger is an established tech brand. The Siphonysta has the potential to be a much sturdier product, but if you’re looking for a fresh and vibrant way to brew your own morning coffee, and are willing to spend, it’s a good option to consider.

But this quesadilla was from Wawa, this Wawa hosted a Tesla Supercharger, and this car was the 2023 Chevrolet Bolt EUV, hooked up to that Supercharger through an NACS/CCS adapter. More than a year after GM’s switch to NACS was announced, and following some Tesla internal chaos that made it seem like a dead deal, Tesla unlocked access to its conveniently placed EV charging stations to General Motors cars in late September. It wasn’t every Supercharger, but it was more than 17,000 spots, many in places that were previously dark zones in any road trip plan. I bought my car knowing that road trips would be an infrequent but real inconvenience. With Tesla's network available now, the anxiety of rolling the CCS dice in unknown lands has lessened considerably. To understand just how this feels, you must first hear about the Before Times. I’ve had my Bolt for a little over a year now, completing four road trips that required DC Fast Charging (DCFC). “Fast” is a misnomer with the Bolt, the slowest-charging modern EV, forcing you to plan across battery levels, nearby amenities, pets, and guesses at crowd timing. Every night before a long ride, I’m pinching, zooming, and stressing inside A Better Route Planner, PlugShare, and Google Maps reviews, asking myself if a ChargePoint in a brewery parking lot will deliver 7 or 9 kilowatts per hour. Despite all this groundwork, I have amassed an impressive collection of fast-charging scars in a year’s time: This story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast. It almost doesn’t matter exactly why or how a non-Tesla charger refuses to work. Damaged cables or plugs, busted screens, cellular data drops, app issues, electrical faults—whatever the reason, it will never get fixed in that moment by calling the support number, and now you need a backup plan. This is how I think Supercharger access is most useful to us, the wretched of the EV earth: a robust backup plan for those tired of the alternatives. Plugging into the country’s most established network requires a none-too-cheap adapter (or finding a rare “Magic Dock” station). You have to find a way to connect a very short cable meant for a specific driver-side, rear-end location to your port. On the Bolt, that’s the middle-front-left, just ahead of the door, possibly the worst place for these cables. You can only charge at third- and fourth-generation chargers. And you have to pay whatever Tesla decides to charge us nonmembers, which is usually on the costlier side (I’ve paid $0.48 and $0.53 per kilowatt-hour). But it’s hard to argue with the locations and reliability of those bright red rectangles. On my most recent trip from Washington, DC, to the Outer Banks of North Carolina, I planned a longer charging stop on the way down at an EVgo in Williamsburg, Virginia, near a shopping plaza with a Target. This worked out because we needed some groceries for the trip. But only two of four chargers were working (after I wasted 5 minutes trying to make a green-in-the-app third station work). Had I wanted to save 11 minutes and up my chances a lot by having 12 stalls to pick from, I could have instead chosen a Tesla Supercharger farther down the road I was already on. Tesla Superchargers tend to be located along highways, near places with restrooms or snacks or shopping, and the Tesla app seems to keep up on how many stalls are occupied and working. With every other network or multibrand app, you’re doing a lot of guessing, which is the bane of road-trip planning. What seems better: Hoping that the very fast 250-kW charger Plugshare shows at a car dealership is available at 9 am on a Sunday, or driving 15 minutes out of your way to a Walmart and waiting your turn? Follow-up question: Have you ever willingly spent 30 minutes at a car dealership when you already own a working car? This kind of thinking spurred me to try some Tesla charging on the way back. I bought an A2Z Typhoon Pro adapter, based on its solid reviews and fast shipping. It also cost notably less than GM’s $225 charger after a coupon code, the GM model was backordered into November, and Chevrolet's app suggested I'd have to pick it up at a dealer. Before I could use any adapter, though, I had to find a spot. The spots are the hard part. At my first stop, a Wawa, every other spot out of eight total was taken, and the one stall that lined up to the side of the car was occupied by a family that told me they would be there 50 minutes. I pulled up in an empty space, tried to stretch its cable, but it wasn’t even close. I pulled away, parked, and started looking for my next stop. Soon after, the father of the 50-minute family appeared in my window. I steeled myself for some kind of lecture, teasing, or maybe political discourse. “You know, you could actually pull up, like, sideways, behind those plugs, and I think it would work,” the father said. He was right; there was nothing behind these Supercharger stations but more parking, and it was empty. I pulled up, plugged in the adapter (quick review: rock solid), pulled over the cord, opened the app, selected the station and charger number, and tapped. Less than 30 seconds later, the juice was flowing. No screens or two plugs sharing one power source, just power. My wife and I went inside and ordered iced coffees and portable breakfasts from a touchscreen. I kept checking the Tesla app out of nervous habit, but current kept moving as expected. My concerns about being the weirdo with a Bolt doing a slant-charge were allayed by walking out to see a gas-powered car parked right in front of a charger, despite a proliferation of other parking nearby (including where my Bolt was). I saw the 50-minute dad stare as the gas car departed, then give his wife and kids a “What can you do?” shrug. I walked over to thank him for his advice, noting that it was my first time trying out this GM-on-Tesla thing. “Aww, that’s OK, man. My sister’s got a weird EV car too, and she has to do stuff like that all the time,\" he said. Given how both this stop and the next one (a mostly empty Sheetz) worked out, I would be cool with Tesla owners thinking the Bolt is a weird interloper. My two Tesla charges were the fastest and most reliable I’ve experienced, at locations that barely took me off my route, in spots good for bathroom breaks and leg stretches. It's only two, and they're certainly not perfect, but I'm not alone in feeling like I've received a free model upgrade. The r/BolteV subreddit has reached the point where people are apologizing for posting their “obligatory picture,” but still getting dozens of upvotes on them. I will happily eat a poblano, egg, and pepperjack quesadilla off to the side, I won’t charge past 80 percent, and I'll do the Tetris parking work, if needed. And I will be as friendly as possible to every other new-to-Superchargers driver who comes along. This story originally appeared on Ars Technica.

            "content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Just after 9 pm on an August night in 2020, Kimberly Thompson and Brian James pulled the car into a driveway in Akron, Ohio, and stepped out into a barrage of gunfire. They were shot in the legs, rushed to a hospital, and survived. But Thompson’s 20-month-old grandson, Tyree Halsell, who was still sitting in the car, was shot in the head and mortally wounded. In the aftermath, Akron police collected video footage from the neighborhood and asked for the public’s help with identifying two men who’d been seen approaching the victims, firing, then fleeing in a truck. Within months, detectives narrowed in on a suspect, Phillip Mendoza, and obtained a search warrant for his cell phone location data from Sprint, according to court records. They also served a geofence warrant on Google, seeking information on devices whose GPS, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth records placed them near the scene of the shooting. Neither warrant turned up any evidence locating Mendoza or his devices on the 1200 block of Fifth Avenue, where the shooting occurred, that night. The investigation stalled until August 2022, when Akron police received a three-page report containing the evidence they’d been seeking. It came from a little-known Canadian company called Global Intelligence, which for the past several years has been selling an extraordinary service to police departments across the United States. Global Intelligence claims that, using only open source data—public information that doesn’t require a warrant—and a suite of more than 700 algorithms, its Cybercheck system allegedly can geolocate an individual in real time or at a specific time in the past by detecting the wireless networks and access points the person’s “cyber profile” has interacted with. The company’s founder, Adam Mosher, has testified under oath that the process is entirely automated, requiring no human intervention from the time an investigator enters basic details about a case into the Cybercheck portal until the time the system produces a report identifying a suspect and their location. If the technology works as advertised, then Global Intelligence is selling police departments previously unknown surveillance capabilities for as little as $309 a case that rival the open source tools used by national spy agencies. But a WIRED review of investigations involving Cybercheck from California to New York, based on hundreds of pages of court filings, testimony, interviews, and police records, suggests Cybercheck is a much less effective tool—one that has provided evidence in high-profile cases that was either demonstrably incorrect or couldn’t be verified by any other means. Open source intelligence experts allege to WIRED that much of the information Cybercheck provides in its reports to law enforcement would be impossible to obtain using only open source data. Indeed, over the past several months, Global Intelligence’s work in Ohio has faded away, with prosecutors ultimately deciding not to use Cybercheck reports as evidence in several murder cases, including Mendoza’s. “Either they’re somehow doing the Minority Report now, or somehow it’s just BS,” says Stephen Coulthart, director of the Open Source Intelligence Laboratory at the State University of New York at Albany, who reviewed Cybercheck reports and transcripts of Mosher’s testimony at WIRED’s request. During a November 2022 trial, Mosher testified that 345 different law enforcement agencies had used Cybercheck to conduct approximately 24,000 searches since 2017. WIRED identified more than a dozen cases involving Cybercheck, including 13 in which prosecutors intended to use Cybercheck reports as evidence at trial. Two of the cases in which courts allowed Cybercheck reports to be admitted as trial evidence resulted in murder convictions. The agencies we found using Cybercheck ranged from small suburban police departments to county sheriffs and state police. The alleged crimes ranged from those related to child sexual abuse material to drive-by shootings, as well as cold cases that have haunted communities for decades. Last year, for example, the New York State Police arrested a man for murder after receiving evidence from Cybercheck that allegedly placed his cell phone at key locations on the night of the homicide, roughly 20 years ago, according to the indictment. The case is scheduled to go to trial in 2025. While Mosher has testified on numerous occasions about Cybercheck, his explanations of what data sources the algorithms draw on and how they reach their conclusions do not fully explain Cybercheck’s ability to produce its reports. Global Intelligence did not answer WIRED’s questions about who designed Cybercheck’s algorithms or what data the company used to train them. When asked how the tool could determine that a person’s cyber profile had pinged a particular wireless network—oftentimes years after the incident occurred—an unnamed Global Intelligence employee wrote in an email: “There is no specific single source of information with regard to wireless network interactions.” In 2022, more than two years after Halsell was shot and killed in Akron, Cybercheck produced a report for police that claimed Mendoza’s cyber profile had pinged two wireless internet devices located near 1228 Fifth Avenue after 9 pm. A cyber profile, from what Mosher has testified, is the amalgamation of names, aliases, emails, phone numbers, IP addresses, Google IDs, and other online identifiers that combine to create a person’s unique digital fingerprint. Summit County prosecutors charged Mendoza with murder. But when Mendoza’s defense attorney, Donald Malarcik, dug into the Cybercheck report, he found a problem. The police department employee who entered the information into Cybercheck’s system had allegedly made a mistake: They had asked the system whether it could locate Mendoza at the scene on August 20, 2020. The shooting occurred on August 2. Cybercheck had nonetheless claimed to locate Mendoza at 1228 Fifth Avenue with 93.13 percent accuracy, even though it was on the wrong day. Stranger still to Malarcik, at some point after delivering the first report, Cybercheck produced another report. It was identical in all respects to the first report—from the MAC addresses, which are unique IDs assigned to networked devices, to the time of day when Mendoza’s cyber profile allegedly pinged them, and the accuracy rating—except it had the correct date of the shooting. The warrants served to Sprint and Google hadn’t produced any evidence that Mendoza’s devices or accounts were at the scene. But according to Cybercheck's entirely automated algorithms, Mendoza’s cyber profile had not only been at 1228 Fifth Avenue at the time of the shooting, it had also been at the exact same location, at the exact same time of day, for the same amount of time, pinging the same wireless networks, 18 days later. The unnamed Cybercheck employee who responded to WIRED’s questions says the company stands by the accuracy of both reports in the Mendoza case. “It is not uncommon to have the same cyber profile with the same device at a location on a different date,” they wrote. Malarcik filed a motion where he asked the prosecutor to provide Cybercheck’s software in another case for which a report had been generated. He also subpoenaed Mosher, and hired a digital forensics expert in an attempt to review the code and the two Cybercheck reports about Mendoza. He tells WIRED that all that experts in a separate case allegedly saw were a couple hundred lines of code that created a program for searching public websites for information about a subject—nothing like the 1 million lines of code and more than 700 algorithms Mosher has testified about in pre-trial hearings. “It was the equivalent of what you would do on a Google search,” Malarcik alleges. “What we didn’t see is the secret sauce, which [Mosher] claims is the machine learning that takes these data points and turns it into intelligence that takes a cyber profile and says it was at this location. That’s what he’s never disclosed to us.” Mosher and Global Intelligence did not respond to WIRED’s questions about Malarcik’s claims. Malarcik requested the court hold what is known as a Daubert hearing to determine whether Mosher’s testimony about Cybercheck’s findings was credible enough to be admitted as evidence in Mendoza’s trial. Two days before the hearing date, Summit County prosecutors decided to not use Cybercheck as evidence. Since then, the prosecutor’s office has withdrawn Cybercheck reports in three other cases, involving four men accused of murder, in which they potentially could have been presented as evidence, according to Malarcik and court records. In early August, Mendoza pleaded guilty and was sentenced to serve at least 15 years of a 15-to-20.5-year sentence. “In the cases we had with Cybercheck that went to trial, there were those aspects that Cybercheck found that the boots-on-the-ground detectives also found,” Brad Gessner, the Summit County prosecutor’s chief counsel, tells WIRED. “Those things matched.” In total, the office has used, or intended to use, Cybercheck reports in 10 cases brought to them by the Akron Police Department, Gessner said. The Akron Beacon Journal and NBC News were the first to report about the county’s use of the tool. The Summit County Sheriff’s Office confirmed to the Akron Beacon Journal this month that it is investigating whether Mosher lied under oath but provided no other details. In other cases—murder trials for Salah Mahdi and Adarus Black—defense attorneys didn’t challenge the use of Cybercheck and the trials resulted in convictions. Both convictions were upheld by an appeals court. Since then, judges overseeing the murder trials of Javion Rankin, Deair Wray, Demonte Carr, and Demetrius Carr have ruled that Cybercheck cannot be admitted as evidence unless Global Intelligence grants the defendants access to its source code. However, the Summit County Prosecutor’s Office appealed several of those rulings, and in September an Ohio appeals court ruled that the trial court erred in excluding the Cybercheck reports as evidence for reasons unrelated to the technology’s effectiveness. In other jurisdictions, WIRED found, prosecutors have also decided not to use Cybercheck reports, or have dropped charges against defendants after defense attorneys scrutinized the findings and Mosher’s testimony. In 2021, Midland County, Texas sheriff’s deputies were investigating the murder of a woman whose burned body had been found in a roadside field. Deputies had arrested the woman’s ex-boyfriend, Sergio Cerna, on unrelated charges. When they searched his phone, according to an affidavit, they found text messages in which he threatened the victim, including texts that read, “Your car is going to be burned down then you will be next.” But they couldn’t find evidence that placed Cerna near the scene of the crime. The sheriff’s office asked Cybercheck for help and received a report claiming that the algorithms had determined, with 97.25 percent accuracy, that Cerna’s cyber profile had pinged a wireless LaserJet printer near the crime scene the day the victim’s body was found. Prosecutors wanted to use the report as evidence at Cerna’s trial, but his defense requested a Daubert hearing. Halfway through the hearing and before the defense could cross-examine Mosher, assistant district attorney Lisa Borden decided not to use Mosher’s testimony or the Cybercheck report at trial. “We would have needed to be able to authenticate that data,” she tells WIRED, but by the time of the Daubert hearing, the printer that Cybercheck had identified in its report couldn’t be located. That was the first, and only, Daubert hearing that Cybercheck has been subjected to in the country, according to court records and Global Intelligence. A Midland County jury convicted Cerna in March and sentenced him to life in prison. Cerna’s attorney said he would appeal the conviction. In Colorado, questions about Mosher and Cybercheck preceded prosecutors’ dropping the charges and sealing the file against a defendant in what law enforcement said was a child sexual abuse material (CSAM) case. After learning that the local district attorney’s office planned to enter Cybercheck evidence at trial and call Mosher as an expert witness, defense attorney Eric Zale hired private investigators to look into Mosher’s background. Mosher told the Boulder County court that he’d previously testified as an expert witness in two CSAM cases in Canada, according to Zale and an appeal brief filed by Malarcik for another client in which a Cybercheck report had been shared in discovery. But after being contacted by Zale’s investigator, the Canadian prosecutors in one of those cases contacted the prosecutor in Boulder County to say that Mosher had never been called to testify in any capacity. The defendant, who was related to Mosher, had pleaded guilty on the first day of the trial. A prosecutor familiar with the other Canadian case wrote to the court that no charges had ever been brought against the person whose trial Mosher had told a judge he testified at. Zale alleges Mosher is “preying on this kind of holy grail of technology to sucker local law enforcement and judges and prosecutors, and frankly some defense counsel” into relying on Cybercheck’s technology. Mosher did not respond to WIRED’s request to comment on Zale’s claims. Global Intelligence did not dispute that Mosher claimed to have testified as an expert in the two Canadian cases. “Mr. Mosher felt at the time that he needed to relay all court participation activities including provision of statements regarding an investigation,” the unnamed Global Intelligence employee wrote. “Other prosecutors have reviewed this matter during other trial proceedings, finding this incident was more of a lost-in-translation issue as opposed to some sort of impropriety.” WIRED requested the names of those prosecutors but did not receive a response. The challenges in Ohio and Texas have hinged on an unusual aspect of Cybercheck that differentiates it from other digital forensics tools: The automated system doesn’t retain supporting evidence for its findings. As Mosher has testified under oath in multiple jurisdictions, Cybercheck doesn’t record where it sources its data, how it draws connections between various data points, or how it specifically calculates its accuracy rates. In Mendoza’s case, for example, no one knows exactly how Cybercheck determined that the email address “ladypimpjuice625@aol.com” belonged to Mendoza. Nor did Global Intelligence explain exactly how the system determined that Mendoza’s cyber profile had pinged the wireless devices near 1228 Fifth Avenue. Mosher has testified that the only information Cybercheck retains during its search process is the data it deems relevant to the investigation, all of which is included in the reports it automatically generates for investigators. Anything else, including potentially contradictory information about who owns a particular email address or online alias, is supposedly processed by the algorithms and used to calculate the accuracy scores that Cybercheck includes in its reports but isn’t archived. “When you're asking, you know, do we preserve all the artifacts and all the data that we crawl—we couldn't realistically do that because it's zettabytes of data,” Mosher testified in the Texas Daubert hearing on January 19, 2024. A zettabyte is equivalent to more than 1 trillion gigabytes. Mosher has testified that Cybercheck doesn’t need to show its work because its conclusions are derived from open source data that anyone with the proper open source intelligence (OSINT) training can find on the web. “If you give that [Cybercheck] report to a skilled investigator that knows cyberspace and machine learning, they're going to come up with the exact same results,” Mosher testified during the murder trial of Adarus Black, in Summit County. Rob Lee is an OSINT expert and chief of research and faculty lead at the SANS Institute, a leading provider of cybersecurity and infosec training. According to Mosher’s résumé and court testimony, Mosher took more than a dozen SANS Institute training courses prior to founding Global Intelligence. At WIRED’s request, Lee and a team of researchers at the SANS Institute reviewed Cybercheck reports and the descriptions of the system that Mosher has given under oath. They say it’s highly unlikely that some of the information in the reports can be gathered from publicly available sources. Specifically, to determine when a particular device has pinged a wireless network, an analyst would need to either physically intercept the signal or have access to the device or the network’s logs, neither of which are open source, Lee says. That kind of access requires a search warrant. “There is a lack of peer review and transparency in [Cybercheck’s] algorithmic processes, which makes me question the legitimacy, sufficiency, and legality of the datasets used for accurate profiling and geolocation,” Lee tells WIRED. “The claim of achieving this level of accuracy using only open source data without further validation and transparency in the tool's methods and data sources is highly suspicious and questionable.” A Global Intelligence employee tells WIRED that law enforcement works with “industry analysts and experts in the open source intelligence space who are manually replicating and backstopping intelligence data from our reports.” They add that “investigations and prosecutions only move ahead on the strength of the evidence gathered by agencies and verified after backstopping Cybercheck intelligence.” The company’s response did not address claims that certain data, such as whether a device connected to a specific Wi-Fi network, are typically not accessible via open source methods. During the Black murder trial in November 2022, Mosher testified that, since January 2021, Cybercheck had run approximately 1,900 searches for suspects’ historical locations and another 1,000 searches for their real-time locations. Out of those 2,900 searches, Mosher testified, there was only one search in which the individual didn’t turn out to be in the location Cybercheck listed for their cyber profile. But in interviews with WIRED and in emails obtained by WIRED through public records requests, more than one of Cybercheck’s law enforcement clients allege the company’s technology provided information that investigators were unable to substantiate or that contradicted reliable sources. In January, Mark Kollar, an assistant superintendent with the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI), wrote an email to Cybercheck about a search warrant his agency had served to an email provider seeking information about an account that Cybercheck linked to a suspect. “The email provider is saying that the email listed in the Cybercheck report doesn’t exist and has never existed,” Kollar wrote. The Ohio BCI, which is a division of the state attorney general’s office, entered into a $30,000 trial contract with Cybercheck in August 2023 and submitted more than a dozen cases to the company, Steve Irwin, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office, tells WIRED. “BCI has not received results on many of the cases and some of the leads produced haven’t panned out,” he says. “Due to the lack of investigative leads that have been produced, BCI has no intentions of entering into another contract with the company.” The Yakima County Sheriff’s Office, in Washington, signed an $11,000 contract in 2022 allowing them to submit 20 cases to Cybercheck. “I think we still have access to Cybercheck, but we don’t use it,” Casey Schilperoort, the sheriff’s public information officer, wrote in an email. “I heard that we don’t receive much or accurate information.” In an unofficial email chain in which investigators from different agencies shared their experiences with the technology, which WIRED obtained through a public record request, Aurora, Colorado detective Nicholas Lesnansky wrote that Cybercheck had identified someone as a suspect in one of his department’s homicide cases because the person’s cyber profile pinged a router located at an address of interest. “Detectives went and spoke to the resident at that home who has lived there for 20+ years and never had a router by that name so we can’t corroborate their information,” Lesnansky wrote. Neither Mosher nor Global Intelligence responded to WIRED’s inquiry about Lesnansky’s claims. In a second Aurora case involving the fatal shooting of a 13-year-old, Global Intelligence staff were “adamant” that Cybercheck had identified the killer, but Lesnansky’s investigation was pointing toward an individual he considered a more likely suspect. “They then came up with a scenario where it was a gang initiation thing where the person they had identified was driving the person I think is more likely around,” Lesnansky wrote. “I doubt the suspect Cybercheck identified and the other person I find more likely are driving around together as one has had his house shot up by the other several times.” On the same email chain, Heather Collins, a special victims unit intelligence analyst with the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, wrote that she used Cybercheck on a missing juvenile case. “They gave us information on possible ‘suspects’ and it wound up being completely false. We located the missing juvenile using other methods. They wasted our time.” Mosher did not respond to WIRED’s questions about Collins’ allegation that the information Global Intelligence provided was false. In other cases, Cybercheck appears to have produced accurate information, although investigators weren’t always able to act on it. Joe Moylan, the public information officer for the Aurora Police Department, says that his agency has requested information from Cybercheck on five cases, and that in two of those cases the technology was “beneficial to the investigations,” although no arrests have been made as a result. In 2017, then 9-year-old Kayla Unbehaun was abducted. For years, the South Elgin, Illinois police department searched for Unbehaun and her noncustodial mother, Heather Unbehaun, who was accused of the abduction, following her trail to Georgia, where they hit a dead end. During that time, the department signed a contract with Global Intelligence, and sergeant Dan Eichholz received a Cybercheck report that placed Unbehaun and her mother in Oregon, he tells WIRED. It was a new lead, but because Cybercheck didn’t provide any evidence to support its findings, Eichholz couldn’t use the report to obtain a search warrant. Unbehaun was finally reunited with her father in 2023, after an employee at a consignment shop in Asheville, North Carolina, recognized her mother from a picture shown on the Netflix show Unsolved Mysteries. After Unbehaun was located, Eichholz learned during the follow-up investigation that, until several months earlier, the pair had indeed been living in Oregon. “I don’t want to say it wasn’t actionable, but I couldn’t just take their information and go with it,” Eichholz says. “That was always the hang-up for us. ‘OK, you got me this information, but I still have to check and verify and do my thing with search warrants.’” The child abduction case against Heather Unbehaun is ongoing. Cybercheck has spread to law enforcement agencies across the country thanks to generous marketing offers and word-of-mouth recommendations. But in interviews with WIRED and the email exchanges we examined, there was little evidence that law enforcement agencies sought or received evidence to support Global Intelligence’s claims about what its technology could do. Prosecutors who spoke to WIRED, such as Borden from Midland County, say they learned about Cybercheck because law enforcement in their jurisdiction had been using it. And when it came up in a case, they let the adversarial court system decide whether or not it was legitimate. “It was new technology and I was curious, so I was like, ‘Let’s give it a try and see how far we can get,’” Borden says. “I’m thankful that it didn’t come into evidence in my case, that I didn’t need it to get my conviction.” Emails show Global Intelligence sales representatives regularly offered to run police departments’ cases through Cybercheck for free in order to demonstrate the technology. They also referenced cases that Global Intelligence characterized as high profile and that Cybercheck supposedly helped solve, without naming the cases outright or providing evidence that Cybercheck had made any difference in the investigations. Emails obtained by WIRED from the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation show that investigators were initially excited to see what information Cybercheck could provide about their cold cases. They even introduced Global Intelligence sales representatives to other law enforcement agencies in Ohio. That enthusiasm seems to have helped convince other agencies to trust the company. Gessner, from the Summit County Prosecutor’s office, says that when his agency was deciding whether to use Cybercheck evidence, it asked the Ohio BCI’s cybercrimes unit for an opinion. “They said, yes, it makes sense … we don't have the technology to do this, but we'd love to have it.” County prosecutors also reached out to the SANS Institute, he says, and were told the institute didn’t “do this type of stuff.” But even as it has withdrawn evidence that Cybercheck provided, Gessner says the Summit County Prosecutor’s Office is asking other companies whether they can do the same kind of open source locating that Global Intelligence marketed. “We don’t want to shut doors that can help point to the truth in our cases,” he says.

            "content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. A Mayan city lost in the dense jungle of southern Mexico has been revealed. The discovery occurred in the southeastern state of Campeche, and archaeologists have named it Valeriana, after a nearby freshwater lagoon. “The larger of Valeriana's two monumental precincts has all the hallmarks of a classic Mayan political capital: enclosed plazas connected by a broad causeway; temple pyramids; a ball court; a reservoir formed by damming an arroyo (a seasonal watercourse); and a probable E-Group assemblage, an architectural arrangement that generally indicates a founding date prior to AD 150,” says the study, published in the journal Antiquity. The city's discovery didn't require breaking through the jungle with machetes or patiently excavating with brushes and spatulas. Nor did researchers need tape measures, binoculars, or compasses to find their way through the thick foliage. Instead, they employed state-of-the-art technology: lasers, drones, and satellite maps. With these tools, they discovered a city hidden for centuries beneath the thick Mexican jungle, unearthing pyramids, enclosed plazas, and an ancient reservoir. Luke Auld-Thomas, a PhD student at Tulane University, made the discovery. His analysis revealed a huge network of previously unexplored settlements. Auld-Thomas and his fellow researchers have succeeded in mapping the city beneath the jungle thanks to airborne laser scanning, better known as lidar (light detection and ranging), a remote-sensing technique that uses pulsed lasers and other data collected through flyovers that can generate accurate three-dimensional models of surface features, revolutionizing the way archaeologists explore the hidden past. Laser pulses generate a topographic map in a manner similar to how a bat uses echolocation: Laser light is fired from an aircraft, bounces off objects on the ground, and returns to the detector located on the underside of the aircraft. In Mexico, although only a small fraction of the pulses pass through the dense jungle, the large number of pulses emitted allows enough light to reach the ground, creating a map with a resolution of up to 1 meter. Based on the timing and intensity of the returning pulses, the detector can map the contours of the terrain, revealing hills, ditches, and ancient ruins covered in vegetation. The technology is also being integrated into autonomous cars to help them avoid crashes. “For a long time, our understanding of the Mayan civilization was limited to an area of a few hundred square kilometers,” Auld-Thomas says. “This limited sample was obtained with great effort, with archaeologists painstakingly scouring every square meter, hacking away at vegetation with machetes, only to discover they were standing on a pile of rocks that might have been someone's house 1,500 years ago.” While Auld-Thomas knew that lidar could be a valuable tool, he was also aware of its high cost. Funders are often reluctant to invest in lidar surveys in areas where there is no visible evidence of Mayan settlement, despite the fact that this civilization reached its peak between 250 and 900 AD. In this case, the lidar data was originally collected over a decade ago, for completely unrelated purposes. The scans were completely in 2013 by the Mexican firm CartoData, using a Riegl LMS-Q780 sensor. Processing was carried out by the Woods Hole Research Center (WHRC), and the data was made publicly available a few years later by the M-REDD+ Alliance. The dataset includes three transects and three study blocks. The transects have an approximate width of 275 meters and a total length of 213 kilometers, covering an area of 58.3 square kilometers. The survey blocks cover a total area of 64.1 square kilometers, distributed in three locations: south of the town of Xpuhil, near the archaeological site of Río Bec; near the villages of Dos Lagunas and Bel Ha; and near the town of Ucum, in northern Campeche. The study mentions that the analysis of 6,764 structures in the lidar data blocks reveals a settlement density of 55.3 structures per square kilometer, comparable to other research in the region. These data are useful for assessing settlement density on a regional scale and exceed values recorded in Belize and Guatemala. However, they do not provide a complete picture of the level of urbanization, which requires analysis of local variability and density gradients. For this purpose, a kernel density estimation was applied to the study blocks, the results of which are consistent with the densities recorded in other Mayan archeological sites such as Oxpemul and Becan. Archeologists in the 20th century were correct in stating that the interior of Campeche is a substantially anthropogenic landscape, i.e., human-modified, with urbanized areas where rural populations interacted with dense cities. Settlement density data, ranging from 49 to 61 structures per square kilometer, indicate that cities and dense settlements are common in large parts of the central Maya lowlands. New discoveries, such as the city of Valeriana, reinforce this view, showing that urbanization was a widespread phenomenon in the region. Lidar images produced by the study's authors. Archaeologists increasingly recognize that the world's tropics and subtropics hosted a wide variety of urban forms in antiquity. Many of these settlements followed a pattern of spatial dispersion, commonly called “low-density urbanism.” However, it is now being recognized that these urban landscapes were not uniform, but exhibited significant variations in settlement density, both within and around cities and between subregions. At the same time, the growing body of research has revealed a greater abundance of settlements and cities than had previously been contemplated. This has generated a tension between two developments: On the one hand, the recognition of high variability in settlement density and, on the other, evidence of a more densely urbanized past than previously thought. Although lidar was developed in the 1960s to study clouds and atmospheric particles, its application in archaeology is relatively recent. It was not until the last decade that archaeologists began employing it to unearth hidden landscapes. In 2009, archaeologists Diane and Arlen Chase of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, pioneered the use of lidar to map a Mayan city, revolutionizing the way ancient civilizations are detected and studied. According to the study, some researchers argue that the discovered landscapes reflect a high population density, while others suggest that the surveys are biased and overrepresent the most densely populated areas. This leaves open the question of whether as yet unexplored areas could confirm the existence of a higher urban density or show less dense occupation.

If Donald Trump wins the US presidential election in November, the guardrails could come off of artificial intelligence development, even as the dangers of defective AI models grow increasingly serious. Trump’s election to a second term would dramatically reshape—and possibly cripple—efforts to protect Americans from the many dangers of poorly designed artificial intelligence, including misinformation, discrimination, and the poisoning of algorithms used in technology like autonomous vehicles. The federal government has begun overseeing and advising AI companies under an executive order that President Joe Biden issued in October 2023. But Trump has vowed to repeal that order, with the Republican Party platform saying it “hinders AI innovation” and “imposes Radical Leftwing ideas” on AI development. Trump’s promise has thrilled critics of the executive order who see it as illegal, dangerous, and an impediment to America’s digital arms race with China. Those critics include many of Trump’s closest allies, from X CEO Elon Musk and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen to Republican members of Congress and nearly two dozen GOP state attorneys general. Trump’s running mate, Ohio senator JD Vance, is staunchly opposed to AI regulation. “Republicans don't want to rush to overregulate this industry,” says Jacob Helberg, a tech executive and AI enthusiast who has been dubbed “Silicon Valley’s Trump whisperer.” But tech and cyber experts warn that eliminating the EO’s safety and security provisions would undermine the trustworthiness of AI models that are increasingly creeping into all aspects of American life, from transportation and medicine to employment and surveillance. The upcoming presidential election, in other words, could help determine whether AI becomes an unparalleled tool of productivity or an uncontrollable agent of chaos. Biden’s order addresses everything from using AI to improve veterans’ health care to setting safeguards for AI’s use in drug discovery. But most of the political controversy over the EO stems from two provisions in the section dealing with digital security risks and real-world safety impacts. One provision requires owners of powerful AI models to report to the government about how they’re training the models and protecting them from tampering and theft, including by providing the results of “red-team tests” designed to find vulnerabilities in AI systems by simulating attacks. The other provision directs the Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to produce guidance that helps companies develop AI models that are safe from cyberattacks and free of biases. Work on these projects is well underway. The government has proposed quarterly reporting requirements for AI developers, and NIST has released AI guidance documents on risk management, secure software development, synthetic content watermarking, and preventing model abuse, in addition to launching multiple initiatives to promote model testing. Supporters of these efforts say they’re essential to maintaining basic government oversight of the rapidly expanding AI industry and nudging developers toward better security. But to conservative critics, the reporting requirement is illegal government overreach that will crush AI innovation and expose developers’ trade secrets, while the NIST guidance is a liberal ploy to infect AI with far-left notions about disinformation and bias that amount to censorship of conservative speech. At a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, last December, Trump took aim at Biden’s EO after alleging without evidence that the Biden administration had already used AI for nefarious purposes. “When I’m reelected,” he said, “I will cancel Biden’s artificial intelligence executive order and ban the use of AI to censor the speech of American citizens on Day One.” Biden’s effort to collect information about how companies are developing, testing, and protecting their AI models sparked an uproar on Capitol Hill almost as soon as it debuted. Congressional Republicans seized on the fact that Biden justified the new requirement by invoking the 1950 Defense Production Act, a wartime measure that lets the government direct private-sector activities to ensure a reliable supply of goods and services. GOP lawmakers called Biden’s move inappropriate, illegal, and unnecessary. Conservatives have also blasted the reporting requirement as a burden on the private sector. The provision “could scare away would-be innovators and impede more ChatGPT-type breakthroughs,” Representative Nancy Mace said during a March hearing she chaired on “White House overreach on AI.” Helberg says a burdensome requirement would benefit established companies and hurt startups. He also says Silicon Valley critics fear the requirements “are a stepping stone” to a licensing regime in which developers must receive government permission to test models. Steve DelBianco, the CEO of the conservative tech group NetChoice, says the requirement to report red-team test results amounts to de facto censorship, given that the government will be looking for problems like bias and disinformation. “I am completely worried about a left-of-center administration … whose red-teaming tests will cause AI to constrain what it generates for fear of triggering these concerns,” he says. Conservatives argue that any regulation that stifles AI innovation will cost the US dearly in the technology competition with China. “They are so aggressive, and they have made dominating AI a core North Star of their strategy for how to fight and win wars,” Helberg says. “The gap between our capabilities and the Chinese keeps shrinking with every passing year.” By including social harms in its AI security guidelines, NIST has outraged conservatives and set off another front in the culture war over content moderation and free speech. Republicans decry the NIST guidance as a form of backdoor government censorship. Senator Ted Cruz recently slammed what he called NIST’s “woke AI ‘safety’ standards” for being part of a Biden administration “plan to control speech” based on “amorphous” social harms. NetChoice has warned NIST that it is exceeding its authority with quasi-regulatory guidelines that upset “the appropriate balance between transparency and free speech.” Many conservatives flatly dismiss the idea that AI can perpetuate social harms and should be designed not to do so. “This is a solution in search of a problem that really doesn't exist,” Helberg says. “There really hasn’t been massive evidence of issues in AI discrimination.” Studies and investigations have repeatedly shown that AI models contain biases that perpetuate discrimination, including in hiring, policing, and health care. Research suggests that people who encounter these biases may unconsciously adopt them. Conservatives worry more about AI companies’ overcorrections to this problem than about the problem itself. “There is a direct inverse correlation between the degree of wokeness in an AI and the AI's usefulness,” Helberg says, citing an early issue with Google’s generative AI platform. Republicans want NIST to focus on AI’s physical safety risks, including its ability to help terrorists build bioweapons (something Biden’s EO does address). If Trump wins, his appointees will likely deemphasize government research on AI’s social harms. Helberg complains that the “enormous amount” of research on AI bias has dwarfed studies of “greater threats related to terrorism and biowarfare.” AI experts and lawmakers offer robust defenses of Biden’s AI safety agenda. These projects “enable the United States to remain on the cutting edge” of AI development “while protecting Americans from potential harms,” says Representative Ted Lieu, the Democratic cochair of the House’s AI task force. The reporting requirements are essential for alerting the government to potentially dangerous new capabilities in increasingly powerful AI models, says a US government official who works on AI issues. The official, who requested anonymity to speak freely, points to OpenAI’s admission about its latest model’s “inconsistent refusal of requests to synthesize nerve agents.” The official says the reporting requirement isn’t overly burdensome. They argue that, unlike AI regulations in the European Union and China, Biden’s EO reflects “a very broad, light-touch approach that continues to foster innovation.” Nick Reese, who served as the Department of Homeland Security’s first director of emerging technology from 2019 to 2023, rejects conservative claims that the reporting requirement will jeopardize companies’ intellectual property. And he says it could actually benefit startups by encouraging them to develop “more computationally efficient,” less data-heavy AI models that fall under the reporting threshold. AI’s power makes government oversight imperative, says Ami Fields-Meyer, who helped draft Biden’s EO as a White House tech official. “We’re talking about companies that say they’re building the most powerful systems in the history of the world,” Fields-Meyer says. “The government’s first obligation is to protect people. ‘Trust me, we’ve got this’ is not an especially compelling argument.” Experts praise NIST’s security guidance as a vital resource for building protections into new technology. They note that flawed AI models can produce serious social harms, including rental and lending discrimination and improper loss of government benefits. Trump’s own first-term AI order required federal AI systems to respect civil rights, something that will require research into social harms. The AI industry has largely welcomed Biden’s safety agenda. “What we're hearing is that it’s broadly useful to have this stuff spelled out,” the US official says. For new companies with small teams, “it expands the capacity of their folks to address these concerns.” Rolling back Biden’s EO would send an alarming signal that “the US government is going to take a hands off approach to AI safety,” says Michael Daniel, a former presidential cyber adviser who now leads the Cyber Threat Alliance, an information sharing nonprofit. As for competition with China, the EO’s defenders say safety rules will actually help America prevail by ensuring that US AI models work better than their Chinese rivals and are protected from Beijing’s economic espionage. If Trump wins the White House next month, expect a sea change in how the government approaches AI safety. Republicans want to prevent AI harms by applying “existing tort and statutory laws” as opposed to enacting broad new restrictions on the technology, Helberg says, and they favor “much greater focus on maximizing the opportunity afforded by AI, rather than overly focusing on risk mitigation.” That would likely spell doom for the reporting requirement and possibly some of the NIST guidance. The reporting requirement could also face legal challenges now that the Supreme Court has weakened the deference that courts used to give agencies in evaluating their regulations. And GOP pushback could even jeopardize NIST’s voluntary AI testing partnerships with leading companies. “What happens to those commitments in a new administration?” the US official asks. This polarization around AI has frustrated technologists who worry that Trump will undermine the quest for safer models. “Alongside the promises of AI are perils,” says Nicol Turner Lee, the director of the Brookings Institution’s Center for Technology Innovation, “and it is vital that the next president continue to ensure the safety and security of these systems.” In your inbox: A new series of tips for how to use AI every day Meet the masked vigilante tracking down billions in crypto scams Deep dive: This app set out to fight pesticides.

In what may be a first, the US Department of Justice this week charged a hacker with attempting to cause injury and death by launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against hospitals. Ahmed Omer and his brother Alaa are accused of carrying out a cyberattack spree that targeted hundreds of victims under the hacktivist banner Anonymous Sudan. The group’s DDoS victims included Microsoft’s Azure cloud services, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and Israel’s missile alert system, according to prosecutors. It was the brothers’ alleged attacks on hospitals, however, that drew the most serious accusations from the Justice Department, which singled out Ahmed for allegedly seeking to kill people with the crude cyberattacks that overwhelm systems, knocking them offline. If someone told you there’s a tool that can—using only open source information—create a “cyber profile” of you that can locate your phone in real time or place you at the scene of a crime at any date in the past, would you believe them? Canadian firm Global Intelligence claims to have created such a tool, dubbed Cybercheck, which it has sold to police departments across the US. Cybercheck-generated reports have been used to help convict at least two people of murder. However, a WIRED investigation found that Cybercheck’s reports have produced information that is either inaccurate or impossible to verify. And open source experts say some of the information Cybercheck claims to include—such as a device’s pings to a specific wireless network—would be impossible to obtain from publicly available sources. The scourge of nonconsensual deepfake images has continued to proliferate, including on Telegram, where millions of people used “nudify” bots to “remove the clothes” of anyone—usually women and girls. A WIRED investigation identified 50 such bots and 25 channels linked to the creation of these abusive AI-generated explicit images. Telegram removed all 75 channels and bots after WIRED reached out, but many of them will likely respawn. The slow death of the password may have gotten a speed boost this week. The FIDO Alliance, a tech industry association, announced new efforts to help hasten the adoption of passkeys, the cryptographically generated codes that are already replacing less-secure passwords. These efforts include a new Credential Exchange Protocol, which makes it easier to migrate passkeys between platforms and devices, and Passkey Central, a resource for company IT departments that aims to make it easier for organizations to adopt passkeys. A group of researchers revealed this week that they created an algorithm that generates a malicious prompt capable of instructing an AI chatbot to identify personal information fed into it by a user and secretly send it to an attacker. Finally, we went back in time to explore how well the US Army’s “solider of tomorrow,” unveiled 65 years ago this week, predicted the future of US military tech. And that’s not all.

If you use uBlock Origin’s Chrome extension to filter out online ads, expect to get mildly annoyed in the near future. Google has begun implementing new Chrome extension standards, called Manifest V3, that will disable the legacy version of uBlock Origin’s extension that most users likely have installed. And while you might be thinking, “Google is a silverback gorilla of online advertising, of course they’re finally forcing me to see ads!” there is some good news. A new version of the ad-filtering extension that meets the Manifest V3 standards, uBlock Origin Lite, is now available. Then again, it won’t block as much as the previous iteration of uBlock. Still, as a Google spokesperson told The Verge, you have options: “The top content filtering extensions all have Manifest V3 versions available — with options for users of AdBlock, Adblock Plus, uBlock Origin and AdGuard.” Either way, you’ll need to install a new extension soon. US authorities announced charges this week against a 25-year-old Alabama man accused of hacking the Security and Exchange Commission’s X account. Prosecutors claim Eric Council Jr. obtained personal information and the materials for a fake ID of a person who controlled the @SECGov account from unidentified coconspirators. Council allegedly used the fake ID to carry out a SIM-swapping attack, duping AT&T retail store staff into giving him a new SIM card, which he ultimately used to take control of the victim’s phone account. The coconspirators used that to gain access to the SEC’s X account, where they posted a fake announcement about Bitcoin’s regulatory status, which was followed by a price jump of $1,000 per bitcoin. Council stands charged of conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud. The grocery store chain Kroger has never used facial-recognition technology broadly in its stores and has no current plans to, a spokesperson told Fast Company this week. The company has been facing a firestorm over its use of electronic shelving labels over concerns that ESLs could be used to impose surge pricing on popular items, and fears that the devices could also be deployed with facial recognition. The company did a single-store facial-recognition pilot of a technology called EDGE in 2019, but it did not move forward with the service. US lawmakers including Rashida Tlaib, Elizabeth Warren, and Robert Casey have publicly raised concerns about Kroger’s use of ESLs. Microsoft told customers that it failed to capture more than two weeks of security logs from certain cloud services in September, including Microsoft Entra, Sentinel, Defender for Cloud, and Purview. News of the lost logs was first reported by Business Insider. The company said in the notification that “a bug in one of Microsoft’s internal monitoring agents resulted in a malfunction in some of the agents when uploading log data to our internal logging platform.” The blank extends from September 2 to September 19. A Microsoft executive confirmed to TechCrunch that the incident was caused by an “operational bug within our internal monitoring agent.” System activity logs are crucial for all sorts of operations and are particularly used for security monitoring and investigations, because they can expose breaches and malicious activity. After Russian hackers breached US government networks through SolarWinds software in 2020, many agencies couldn’t detect the activity in their Microsoft Azure cloud services because they weren’t paying for Microsoft’s premium tier features, so they didn’t have adequate network activity logs. Lawmakers were outraged about the up-charge, and the Biden administration worked for more than two years to get Microsoft to make the logging services free. The company ultimately announced the change in July 2023.

            "content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. On Saturday, an Associated Press investigation revealed that OpenAI's Whisper transcription tool creates fabricated text in medical and business settings despite warnings against such use. The AP interviewed more than 12 software engineers, developers, and researchers who found the model regularly invents text that speakers never said, a phenomenon often called a “confabulation” or “hallucination” in the AI field. Upon its release in 2022, OpenAI claimed that Whisper approached “human level robustness” in audio transcription accuracy. However, a University of Michigan researcher told the AP that Whisper created false text in 80 percent of public meeting transcripts examined. Another developer, unnamed in the AP report, claimed to have found invented content in almost all of his 26,000 test transcriptions. The fabrications pose particular risks in health care settings. Despite OpenAI’s warnings against using Whisper for “high-risk domains,” over 30,000 medical workers now use Whisper-based tools to transcribe patient visits, according to the AP report. The Mankato Clinic in Minnesota and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles are among 40 health systems using a Whisper-powered AI copilot service from medical tech company Nabla that is fine-tuned on medical terminology. This story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast. Nabla acknowledges that Whisper can confabulate, but it also reportedly erases original audio recordings “for data safety reasons.” This could cause additional issues, since doctors cannot verify accuracy against the source material. And deaf patients may be highly impacted by mistaken transcripts since they would have no way to know if medical transcript audio is accurate or not. The potential problems with Whisper extend beyond health care. Researchers from Cornell University and the University of Virginia studied thousands of audio samples and found Whisper adding nonexistent violent content and racial commentary to neutral speech. They found that 1 percent of samples included “entire hallucinated phrases or sentences which did not exist in any form in the underlying audio” and that 38 percent of those included “explicit harms such as perpetuating violence, making up inaccurate associations, or implying false authority.” In one case from the study cited by AP, when a speaker described “two other girls and one lady,” Whisper added fictional text specifying that they “were Black.” In another, the audio said, “He, the boy, was going to, I’m not sure exactly, take the umbrella.” Whisper transcribed it to, “He took a big piece of a cross, a teeny, small piece … I’m sure he didn’t have a terror knife so he killed a number of people.” An OpenAI spokesperson told the AP that the company appreciates the researchers’ findings and that it actively studies how to reduce fabrications and incorporates feedback in updates to the model. The key to Whisper’s unsuitability in high-risk domains comes from its propensity to sometimes confabulate, or plausibly make up, inaccurate outputs. The AP report says, \"Researchers aren’t certain why Whisper and similar tools hallucinate,\" but that isn't true. We know exactly why Transformer-based AI models like Whisper behave this way. Whisper is based on technology that is designed to predict the next most likely token (chunk of data) that should appear after a sequence of tokens provided by a user. In the case of ChatGPT, the input tokens come in the form of a text prompt. In the case of Whisper, the input is tokenized audio data. The transcription output from Whisper is a prediction of what is most likely, not what is most accurate. Accuracy in Transformer-based outputs is typically proportional to the presence of relevant accurate data in the training dataset, but it is never guaranteed. If there is ever a case where there isn't enough contextual information in its neural network for Whisper to make an accurate prediction about how to transcribe a particular segment of audio, the model will fall back on what it “knows” about the relationships between sounds and words it has learned from its training data. According to OpenAI in 2022, Whisper learned those statistical relationships from “680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web.” But we now know a little more about the source. Given Whisper's well-known tendency to produce certain outputs like \"thank you for watching,\" \"like and subscribe,\" or \"drop a comment in the section below\" when provided silent or garbled inputs, it's likely that OpenAI trained Whisper on thousands of hours of captioned audio scraped from YouTube videos. (The researchers needed audio paired with existing captions to train the model.) There's also a phenomenon called “overfitting” in AI models where information (in this case, text found in audio transcriptions) encountered more frequently in the training data is more likely to be reproduced in an output. In cases where Whisper encounters poor-quality audio in medical notes, the AI model will produce what its neural network predicts is the most likely output, even if it is incorrect. And the most likely output for any given YouTube video, since so many people say it, is “thanks for watching.” In other cases, Whisper seems to draw on the context of the conversation to fill in what should come next, which can lead to problems because its training data could include racist commentary or inaccurate medical information. For example, if many examples of training data featured speakers saying the phrase “crimes by Black criminals,” when Whisper encounters a “crimes by [garbled audio] criminals” audio sample, it will be more likely to fill in the transcription with “Black.\" In the original Whisper model card, OpenAI researchers wrote about this very phenomenon: \"Because the models are trained in a weakly supervised manner using large-scale noisy data, the predictions may include texts that are not actually spoken in the audio input (i.e. hallucination). We hypothesize that this happens because, given their general knowledge of language, the models combine trying to predict the next word in audio with trying to transcribe the audio itself.\" So in that sense, Whisper \"knows\" something about the content of what is being said and keeps track of the context of the conversation, which can lead to issues like the one where Whisper identified two women as being Black even though that information was not contained in the original audio. Theoretically, this erroneous scenario could be reduced by using a second AI model trained to pick out areas of confusing audio where the Whisper model is likely to confabulate and flag the transcript in that location, so a human could manually check those instances for accuracy later. Clearly, OpenAI's advice not to use Whisper in high-risk domains, such as critical medical records, was a good one. But health care companies are constantly driven by a need to decrease costs by using seemingly \"good enough\" AI tools—as we've seen with Epic Systems using GPT-4 for medical records and UnitedHealth using a flawed AI model for insurance decisions. It's entirely possible that people are already suffering negative outcomes due to AI mistakes, and fixing them will likely involve some sort of regulation and certification of AI tools used in the medical field.

Actors didn’t care for the notion that their likenesses could be used without their permission, whether by the studios that hired them that week or by someone at home with a computer in 2040. Writers didn’t want to do punch-ups on potentially crummy AI scripts or have their words (or ideas) cannibalized by large language models that didn’t pay them a dime. But while some Hollywood filmmakers came out of the strikes fearful of how AI might wreck their industries, others wanted to learn more. This week, many of those filmmakers gathered in a movie theater in Culver City, California, for the inaugural Culver Cup, a generative-AI film competition sponsored by FBRC.AI and Amazon Web Services. Hundreds of moviemakers applied to be in the competition, and 50 were chosen. They got prompts and a production manifesto from Black Mirror: Bandersnatch and Hard Candy director David Slade, credits to use on AI tools like Luma Dream Machine and Playbook, and a 3D version of a diner from Global Objects to use as a setting. They had a little under three weeks to turn in a two- to five-minute short. From those, eight were chosen to compete (you can watch seven of them here), in-person, with the audience at Monday’s LA Tech Week event selecting the ultimate winner. The Culver Cup championship belt that is awarded to the winner of the Culver Cup gen AI film competition. The final bracket for the Culver Cup. The competition was meant to be “a little experiment,” says FBRC.AI cofounder Todd Terrazas, a way to gauge where the still nascent scene is now compared to where it’s been and where it’s going. Some mistakes in the shorts were inevitable, like inconsistencies in characters or noticeable visual artifacts, but event attendees generally seemed to come away impressed. Jon Jones, the head of AWS Startups, says the point was to see “what’s possible, not what’s perfect.” Figuring out what’s possible is a fraught proposition when it comes to AI in Hollywood. Because even while AWS Startups is working with companies making generative AI tools for filmmaking, the division of Amazon that produces content for Prime Video spent much of last year bargaining with writers’ and actors’ unions, as part of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, over best practices for using AI in movie- and TV-making. The AMPTP has been negotiating with animators over AI, among other things, since August. Amazon MGM Studios wasn’t involved with the Culver Cup. Instead, the event was an attempt to show how AI could be used to automate processes that independent filmmakers couldn’t do on their own. Hollywood will have to figure out the most fair way to use them. A similar refrain came out of Adobe’s Max conference this week, where the company showed off new AI-powered video-editing tools while claiming they’re “not a replacement for human creativity.” Meta sang a similar tune on Thursday, when the company announced a collaboration with Blumhouse for which the horror studio paired filmmakers—Casey Affleck, Searching’s Aneesh Chaganty—with Meta researchers to test out its forthcoming Movie Gen video tool. Connor Hayes, Meta’s head of gen AI, said in a blog post that it was about figuring out the “responsible use” of AI. Blumhouse CEO Jason Blum said the studio “welcomed the chance” to allow directors to “test this cutting-edge technology and give their notes on its pros and cons while it’s still in development.” As a longtime director, Slade says he saw his role in the Culver Cup similarly. He wants to be a sober voice in the conversation about the technology’s role in filmmaking, even as he’s quick to admit that “there are things that terrify [him] about AI.” If anyone can make a gen AI film, he argues, then perhaps that’s how you find the next James Cameron or the next David Lynch. “I couldn’t make a full-length, Pixar-like feature film on my own, just due to the amount of time to do every single second of animation,” says Playbook CTO Skylar Thomas, “but with gen AI, the volume that the individual contributor can create is that much higher, and that’s super exciting.” (It’s also cheaper, with Playbook cofounder JD LeRoy noting that a single second of VFX in a movie can cost anywhere from $2,000 to $20,000, depending on complexity.) Gen AI also means filmmakers can do more with less—or without access to the bureaucrats, budgets, and gatekeepers that have traditionally dictated what gets made in Hollywood. “The thing about making films is that, if you go to a studio, it costs a million dollars to take the camera out of the box,” says Slade. “That’s just the way it is. You’re immediately working in a very high-stress scenario where a lot of people are asking a lot of you and you’re asking a lot of permission to do everything you do.” Granted, gen AI’s next auteur, animated or otherwise, probably won’t just be some Joe off the street with an idea and no technical know-how. Most of the Culver Cup finalists have some sort of filmmaking background or education, which has clearly given them a leg up in terms of the technical processes and general lingo involved in creation. The contest’s winner, who goes by the name Meta Puppet, says he’s been a full-time video editor for 18 years, as well as an actor and a screenwriter. “You have to learn the fundamentals,” he says. “Technology will change, but storytelling won’t.” To make his short, “Mnemonade,” really sing, Meta Puppet says he focused on giving the story some emotional heft. “I don’t think AI films will go fully mainstream until we get emotional dialog,” he says. He played all the roles in his short, about the poignance of sense memory and an elderly woman’s loss of memory, using AI from Silicon Valley “unicorn” ElevenLabs to shift his vocal performance into each character’s range and voice. Maddie Hong, who went head-to-head with Meta Puppet in the Culver Cup finals, says that she understands Hollywood’s trepidation when it comes to AI. “There’s more potential for legal backlash and financial loss,” she says, referring to the danger of unintended (or even flagrant) copyright infringement during generation. The studios also have a “higher standard for image continuity,” Hong says, “given that they’re thinking about distribution on all types of platforms and screens.” That being said, Hong agrees with people like Luma cofounder Amit Jain, who says that gen AI filmmaking could give the traditional studio system some flexibility in terms of budget and diversity of product. “If you look at Hollywood today,” Jain says, “the majority of the high-budget productions are just recycling old franchises because it’s too tough to bet on a new idea or a new franchise .” It’s just safer, he says, to reproduce something than it is to imagine something new. In Jain’s (admittedly biased) view, making more projects, even with lower budgets, means more people will work and more money will come rolling in. “I would actually posit,” he adds, “that people will actually have far better careers that are more fulfilling and long-lasting when they’re able to produce things that people actually do want to watch.” If there’s going to be any job loss in Hollywood because of AI, he suggests, the people who are going to go will be the ones most resistant to AI. Recent research contradicts that notion. A survey of 300 entertainment industry leaders conducted earlier this year found that 75 percent believed gen AI had led to the elimination, reduction, or consolidation of jobs within their departments. It had also led to the creation of some jobs, but it was “not clear” if new jobs would offset jobs lost. Other studies have examined how the VFX world in particular might be affected by more AI in production, with artists typically reporting interest or excitement around tools that could streamline their sometimes tedious workflows, but concern about the ethical and financial implications of the technology. While it would be cool, as Jain suggests, to team up with 11 of your friends to “make a feature film about a Boston Terrier that has superpowers” for relatively little money, it remains to be seen what effect the impact of sweeping AI availability will have on the industry as a whole. For Meta Puppet, it comes down to skill, and who has it. “I liken gen AI to the piano,” he says. “Everybody knows about the piano. Not everybody is Mozart. Writing real masterpieces with AI, you have to wear a lot of hats, which is a good and a bad thing because if you have experience, that’s great. If you don’t, whatever you make is probably going to be bad.” This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

Just one day after OpenAI announced a $6.6 billion funding round, the company is launching its first major interface evolution for ChatGPT. In what could be recognition from OpenAI that its transformational chatbot is ready for user experiences beyond a question and answer format, the new beta feature is an editable canvas that opens in a window alongside ChatGPT’s standard chat box. “The core thing we're trying to solve is a better way to collaborate with ChatGPT on writing and coding,” says Daniel Levine, a product lead at OpenAI for the canvas feature. Canvas is rolling out in beta to ChatGPT Plus and Team subscribers today, and Enterprise and Edu customers will likely get the feature next week. The feature is fully functional on desktops—mobile users can only view the canvas projects for now. During a prelaunch demo to WIRED, Levine focused on a hope for more “natural” feeling human-AI collaboration with this new option. His team used synthetic data generated by OpenAI’s latest model, o1-preview, to give GPT-4o’s model useful canvas features, like knowing when to activate and how much to adjust the document. With canvas, ChatGPT can generate a starting draft of a project for you and the AI to edit together, or you can paste an existing draft of what you’re working on for feedback. Levine started off by asking ChatGPT to use canvas to help draft a crucial email. He followed up by highlighting a couple of paragraphs and requesting specific changes. The generative AI tool is able to add comments in the canvas to note potential improvements or can even directly change what’s in the document. Opening a canvas is simple: Just add a phrase like “use canvas …” or “start a canvas …” to your prompt and the new window will appear. For some writing prompts, like requests to generate a draft blog post, the GPT-4o model is trained to launch a canvas without you even invoking the tool, if it's deemed helpful. For coding projects, the model only starts a canvas when directly requested. Although both writing and coding modes give the choice of requesting in-line edits, the bifurcated user interface for canvas is designed with one additional set of shortcuts for those focused on AI-assisted writing and another for coders. In the demo, Levine showed off how the writer’s shortcut could be used to condense the number of words in a canvas or attempt to perform a “final polish” on the draft. He also used one of the more lighthearted shortcuts to add a bunch of random emoji. On the coder’s side, ChatGPT can add logs, comments, and attempt to troubleshoot problems in a canvas. ChatGPT saves different versions of the canvas as you’re iterating, so you can return to old versions if you end up preferring that output. Writers who may be worried about what they upload being used by OpenAI to train its model should go into their user settings and make sure that “model training” is toggled off. By allowing ChatGPT to make edits as well as suggestions, OpenAI is blurring the line between authorship and word curation. As someone who works with professional editors daily, I’m skeptical the canvas beta will match their incisive notes and careful guidance. But for people who don’t have easy access to human writing partners, I can see how getting synthetic notes on a composition about structure and content would be beneficial. It’s worth noting that three people listed as “supporting leadership” on the canvas project are no longer with the company. Former post-training colead and cofounder John Schulman left in August and now works at Anthropic, a rival AI company. Additionally, former chief technology officer Mira Murati and research vice president Barret Zoph both stepped down from their positions a week before this launch. At a press event in the OpenAI office after the departures, current chief product officer Kevin Weil reaffirmed the company’s commitment to continue releasing software. “I think 2025 is gonna be the year that agentic systems finally hit the mainstream,” he says. The idea of an AI “agent” that can not only work through software tasks alongside you, but is also nimble enough to be sent off into the digital wilderness to do things on your behalf, is simultaneously generative AI’s recent past and projected future. Last year, WIRED covered ChatGPT’s plug-ins people could use for tasks, like booking flights with Expedia or making a reservation with OpenTable—arguably a step toward more “agentic” AI tools. However, plug-ins were later wound down, with more limited custom GPT chatbots launched in their place. Keeping that in mind, the beta release of canvas does appear to be another attempt at augmenting AI models with more decisionmaking abilities, which can lead to surprises. During one of WIRED’s demos, Levine highlighted a portion of the canvas and requested an edit, and ChatGPT subsequently made an in-line change near the bottom, outside his highlight. “The really interesting thing is oftentimes, if you highlight a section, it will make an edit in that part,” he says. “But ChatGPT has the option to decide where to edit.” The closest alternative to OpenAI’s canvas tool available right now is probably Google’s Gemini integration that lets you use generative AI inside of Docs or Anthropic's Artifacts tool. Chatbots definitely aren’t dead, but AI companies are now acknowledging the format’s constraints and looking for ways to diversify their software to uncover novel, sticky user interfaces. Google recently received praise in tech circles for its entertaining AI podcasts—even CEO Sam Altman lauded the tool. With billions of investment dollars still flowing through Silicon Valley to AI companies, consumers can expect to see more of these structural experiments that build on existing tools, like AI podcast hosts and AI document editors, to be released with a regular cadence over the next year. The chatbot race is far from over, and future iterations on the technology are likely to stray far away from that drab chatbox, and toward a more multifaceted approach.

A $2 million contract that United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement signed with Israeli commercial spyware vendor Paragon Solutions has been paused and placed under compliance review, WIRED has learned. The White House’s scrutiny of the contract marks the first test of the Biden administration’s executive order restricting the government’s use of spyware. The one-year contract between Paragon’s US subsidiary in Chantilly, Virginia, and ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Division 3 was signed on September 27 and first reported by WIRED on October 1. A few days later, on October 8, HSI issued a stop-work order for the award “to review and verify compliance with Executive Order 14093,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson tells WIRED. The executive order signed by President Joe Biden in March 2023 aims to restrict the US government’s use of commercial spyware technology while promoting its “responsible use” that aligns with the protection of human rights. DHS did not confirm whether the contract, which says it covers a “fully configured proprietary solution including license, hardware, warranty, maintenance, and training,” includes the deployment of Paragon’s flagship product, Graphite, a powerful spyware tool that reportedly extracts data primarily from cloud backups. “We immediately engaged the leadership at DHS and worked very collaboratively together to understand exactly what was put in place, what the scope of this contract was, and whether or not it adhered to the procedures and requirements of the executive order,” a senior US administration official with first-hand knowledge of the workings of the executive order tells WIRED. The official requested anonymity to speak candidly about the White House’s review of the ICE contract. Paragon Solutions did not respond to WIRED's request to comment on the contract's review. The process laid out in the executive order requires a robust review of the due diligence regarding both the vendor and the tool, to see whether any concerns, such as counterintelligence, security, and improper use risks, arise. It also stipulates that an agency may not make operational use of the commercial spyware until at least seven days after providing this information to the White House or until the president's national security adviser consents. “Ultimately, there will have to be a determination made by the leadership of the department. The outcome may be—based on the information and the facts that we have—that this particular vendor and tool does not spur a violation of the requirements in the executive order,” the senior official says. While publicly available details of ICE’s contract with Paragon are relatively sparse, its existence alone raised alarms among civil liberties groups, with the nonprofit watchdog Human Rights Watch saying in a statement that “giving ICE access to spyware risks exacerbating” the department’s problematic practices. HRW also questioned what it calls the Biden administration’s “piecemeal approach” to spyware regulation. The level of seriousness with which the US government approaches the compliance review of the Paragon contract will influence international trust in the executive order, experts say. “We know the dangers mercenary spyware poses when sold to dictatorships, but there is also plenty of evidence of harms in democracies,” says John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab who has been instrumental in exposing spyware-related abuses. “This is why oversight, transparency, and accountability around any US agency attempt to acquire these tools is essential.” International efforts to rein in commercial spyware are gathering pace. On October 11, during the 57th session of the Human Rights Council, United Nation member states reached a consensus to adopt language acknowledging the threat that the misuse of commercial spyware poses to democratic values, as well as the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. “This is an important norm setting, especially for countries who claim to be democracies,” says Natalia Krapiva, senior tech-legal counsel at international nonprofit Access Now. Although the US is leading global efforts to combat spyware through its executive order, trade and visa restrictions, and sanctions, the European Union has been more lenient. Only 11 of the 27 EU member states have joined the US-led initiative stipulated in the “Joint Statement on Efforts to Counter the Proliferation and Misuse of Commercial Spyware,” which now counts 21 signatories, including Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, Japan, and South Korea. “An unregulated market is both a threat to the citizens of those countries, but also to those governments, and I think that increasingly our hope is that there is a recognition [in the EU] of that as well,” the senior US administration official tells WIRED. The European Commission published on October 16 new guidelines on the export of cyber-surveillance items, including spyware; however, it has yet to respond to the EU Parliament's call to draft a legislative proposal or admonish countries for their misuse of the technology. While Poland launched an inquiry into the previous government’s spyware use earlier this year, a probe in Spain over the use of spyware against Spanish politicians has so far led to no accusations against those involved, and one in Greece has cleared government agencies of any wrongdoing. “Europe is in the midst of a mercenary spyware crisis,” says Scott-Railton. “I have looked on with puzzled wonderment as European institutions and governments fail to address this issue at scale, even though there are domestic and export-related international issues.” With the executive order, the US focuses on its national security and foreign policy interests in the deployment of the technology in accordance with human rights and the rule of law, as well as mitigating counterintelligence risks (e.g. the targeting of US officials). Europe—though it acknowledges the foreign policy dimension—has so far primarily concentrated on human rights considerations rather than counterintelligence and national security threats. Such a threat became apparent in August, when Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) found that Russian government hackers were using exploits made by spyware companies NSO Group and Intellexa. Meanwhile, Access Now and Citizen Lab speculated in May that Estonia may have been behind the hacking of exiled Russian journalists, dissidents, and others with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. “In an attempt to protect themselves from Russia, some European countries are using the same tools against the same people that Russia is targeting,” says Access Now’s Krapiva. “By having easier access to this kind of vulnerabilities, because they are then sold on the black market, Russia is able to purchase them in the end.” “It’s a huge mess,” she adds. “By attempting to protect national security, they actually undermine it in many ways.” Citizen Lab’s Scott-Railton believes these developments should raise concern among European decisionmakers just as they have for their US counterparts, who emphasized the national security aspect in the executive order. “What is it going to take for European heads of state to recognize they have a national security threat from this technology?” Scott-Railton says. “Until they recognize the twin human rights and national security threats, the way the US has, they are going to be at a tremendous security disadvantage.” In your inbox: Upgrade your life with WIRED-tested gear A bitcoin mining dream turned into a nightmare The Big Story: An oral history of WIRED’s original website I made a wholesome OnlyFans to try to make ends meet Election: Follow WIRED’s 2024 US election coverage here More From WIRED Reviews and Guides © 2024 Condé Nast.

Peter Todd is standing on the upper floor of a dilapidated industrial building somewhere in Czechia, chuckling under his breath. He has just been accused on camera of being Satoshi Nakamoto, the Bitcoin creator, whose identity has remained a mystery for 15 years. In the final scene of a new HBO documentary, Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery, documentarian Cullen Hoback confronts Todd with the theory that he is Satoshi. In a previous work, Hoback unmasked the figure behind QAnon. Here, he tries to repeat the trick with Bitcoin. “I will admit, you’re pretty creative—you come up with some crazy theories,” Todd tells Hoback, before rejecting the idea as “ludicrous.” “I warn you, this is going to be very funny when you put this into the documentary.” The film stops short of claiming to have conclusively unmasked the creator of Bitcoin, absent incontrovertible proof. “For the record, I am not Satoshi,” Todd says in an email. “It is a useless question, because Satoshi would simply deny it.” The hunt for Bitcoin’s creator has yielded a broad cast of Satoshis over the years, among them Hal Finney, recipient of the first ever bitcoin transaction; Adam Back, designer of a precursor technology cited in the Bitcoin white paper; and cryptographer Nick Szabo, to name just a few. The finger is pointed at some; others elect themselves. But though Satoshi has had many faces, a consensus has formed around none of them. “People have suspected basically everyone of being Satoshi,” Todd points out, early in the documentary. “The problem with this kind of stuff is that people play all these crazy games.” WIRED has its own place in the history of the hunt for Satoshi. On the same day in December 2015, WIRED and Gizmodo separately nominated Australian computer scientist Craig Wright as a potential Satoshi. The original story, based on a trove of leaked documents, proposed that Wright had “either invented Bitcoin or is a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did.\" A few days later, WIRED published a second story, pointing to discrepancies in the evidence that supported the latter interpretation. In March, a judge in the UK High Court ruled categorically that Wright is not Satoshi, closing a case brought by a group of crypto firms to prevent the Australian from bringing nuisance legal claims. During the two months I spent covering the Wright trial, multiple Satoshis appeared in my inbox, too. “The world is not ready to learn about Satoshi Nakamoto, and they never will unless certain conditions are met,” wrote one of them, in a garbled message. Hell, I even met a would-be Satoshi in-person, in the waiting area outside the courtroom. The man, who had introduced himself as Satoshi, sat down in the public gallery to hear closing arguments. Before long, he nodded off, chin slumped against chest. One of the other onlookers anointed him “Sleeptoshi.” Plenty of bitcoiners welcome this strange, crypto version of “I Am Spartacus,” preferring that the identity of Bitcoin’s creator forever remain a mystery. Free from the overbearing influence of a founder, Bitcoin has evolved under a system of unspoiled anarchy, they say, in which nobody’s opinion is worth more than any other. Everyone is Satoshi, and nobody is Satoshi. “Satoshi’s greatest gift to the world was Bitcoin,” Jameson Lopp, an early bitcoiner and founder of crypto custody business Casa, told me earlier in the year. “His second greatest gift was to disappear.” The main evidence supplied in the documentary to back up the theory that Todd created Bitcoin is a forum thread from December 2010 in which Todd appears to be “finishing Satoshi’s sentences,” as Hoback puts it. The topic of that thread—a way to prioritize transactions based on the fee paid—is something Todd would later go on to build into Bitcoin as a contributing developer. As corroborating evidence, Hoback points to similarities in the grammar and syntax used by Todd and Satoshi, as well as the timing of Satoshi’s communications, many of which were composed during the summer, when Todd would not have had college classes to attend. (Todd disputes the characterization of his availability during the relevant summers.) Todd is well known in crypto circles for his contributions to the Bitcoin codebase and vocal advocacy for the technology as an alternative to cash—a supposedly surveillance-resistant tool for the digital world. At a conference in 2023, I watched as Todd, participating in a panel, said “fuck you” to the audience unless they exercised their right to make cash purchases that cannot be monitored by government or bank. Todd has conceded to having previously tried to develop a technology similar to Bitcoin, before Satoshi beat him to it. In their 2008 white paper, released in the shadow of a global financial meltdown, Satoshi sketched a vision for a new electronic cash and peer-to-peer payment system that would cut out money-grubbing financial intermediaries. In January 2009, they sent the first bitcoin transaction. A little more than two years later, they vanished from public view, leaving behind a pot of bitcoin—now worth billions—that has been undisturbed ever since. Those inclined to continue the hunt, like Hoback, point to the immense influence Satoshi would have should they ever return, such is the size of their dormant bitcoin stash. This is an asset that now forms part of 401ks, after all. The most hardcore believers even think it will displace the US dollar as the predominant global currency. For all the urgency and seriousness with which he now refutes the claim, Todd himself plays Satoshi doublespeak, telling the camera with a straight face that he is Satoshi, then lapsing into a wry grin. “By the way, everyone is Satoshi,” says Todd, in one instance. Another bitcoiner in the film describes Todd as “the contrarian of contrarians.” But whether or not he is the real Satoshi, Todd shares the view that some secrets are better kept and some questions better unasked. To expose Satoshi, he says, would be to open them up to personal safety risks. Imagine the attention Satoshi might receive from violent extortionists, with his multibillion-dollar trove of bitcoin. “Satoshi obviously didn't want to be found, for good reasons. No one should help people trying to find Satoshi,” wrote Todd, in his email to the press. “Making fun of the question itself is just good manners.” In your inbox: A new series of tips for how to use AI every day Meet the masked vigilante tracking down billions in crypto scams Deep dive: This app set out to fight pesticides.

            "content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. On Thursday evening, at around 7 pm Pacific time, Tesla is slated to unveil the newest vehicle in its lineup: one that will be able to drive itself. A purpose-built Tesla robot taxi—a Cybercab, in the electric automaker’s parlance—is meant to establish the company as less a manufacturer of cars than a maker of pathbreaking robotics technology. “The way to think of Tesla is almost entirely in terms of solving autonomy and being able to turn on that autonomy for a gigantic fleet,” CEO Elon Musk told Tesla investors in April. As Musk takes the stage Thursday at the Warner Bros. Discovery movie studio in Burbank, California, and attempts to usher that substantial (and difficult) vision into reality, canny observers should keep watch for information about Tesla’s service that extends beyond the vehicle itself—the robot devil will likely be in the robot details. Ride-hailing services are logistically complex, governed by liability laws and state-by-state regulations. Sometimes, robot taxis are attacked by vandals. To run a robotaxi fleet, Tesla will have to work out all of those pieces. The Tesla robotaxi has been a long time coming. Musk made his first promise about a self-driving, Uber-like service back in 2019, when he said that Tesla would have 1 million robotaxis on the road by the end of 2020. At the time, the idea was that the automaker would be able to effectively “flip a switch” to transform on-the-road Teslas into autonomous robots able to do their drivers’ bidding—including pick up fares!—during down times. This past April, Musk announced the official Cybercab reveal would take place in August, then he delayed it after saying the vehicle needed design tweaks. Now, Tesla has made a purpose-built autonomous electric vehicle, owned and operated by the company itself, more central to its future robotaxi fleet. Musk has likened the business model to a mix of Airbnb and Uber, but maintains, as he said in April, that “there will be some number of cars that Tesla owns itself and operates in the fleet.” Tesla has shown renderings depicting what a self-driving robotaxi app might look like. And earlier this year, Tesla AI head Ashok Elluswamy intimated that the automaker had at least a sense of the challenge ahead, when he acknowledged to investors that Cybercabs will need to be charged, cleaned, and maintained in between ferrying passengers about day and night. Who will do that, and where? And who will pay for it? A self-driving ride-hail service would put Tesla in direct competition with other tech developers with years’ worth of head starts. Alphabet subsidiary Waymo says it’s providing 100,000 paid trips per week in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. It has plans to launch in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta, Georgia, next year. Amazon’s Zoox is testing its purpose-built, toaster-shaped robotaxi in Las Vegas, and has said it will launch an autonomous taxi service later this year. There may be a “last mover” advantage, though; perhaps Tesla can learn from what other self-driving developers have done poorly, and well. Waymo, which does not make its own vehicles but installs self-driving tech on other automakers’ EVs, has zeroed in on a business model that could leave the Google sister company responsible for just tech development. Last month, Waymo announced a partnership with Uber, which should see self-driving vehicles running on the ride-hail company’s platform in Atlanta and Austin by the end of next year. Waymo would retain control of the self-driving technology and some rider support functions, the companies said, but Uber will provide “fleet management services”—vehicle cleaning, repair, and other depot operations. In this arrangement, a single entity would not be responsible for the workings of an entire robot ride-hailing fleet. There may also be a lesson to learn about playing nice with regulators. Another competitor, General Motors’ Cruise, suffered serious setbacks after regulators accused the self-driving vehicle developer of obscuring details of a gruesome October 2023 collision that critically injured a pedestrian, an incident that led to more than $1 million in federal fines, lost operating permits in the state of California, serious shakeups in the firm’s executive ranks, and a multimillion-dollar settlement for the crash victim. Cruise has been back-testing its autonomous tech in Arizona and Texas since earlier this spring. But the fallout from the collision demonstrates the perils of angering regulators while deploying new technology on public roads. Tesla does not seem to have gotten in touch with crucial California autonomous vehicle regulators about a robotaxi service, despite basing its engineering headquarters in Palo Alto. A spokesperson for the California Public Utilities Commission, which licenses ride-hail operations in the state, said the agency hasn’t had contact with the company about autonomous permits. Tesla does have a permit to test autonomous vehicles in the state of California through the Department of Motor Vehicles, but last year the company didn’t report any autonomous driving miles to the state. Waymo, Zoox, and even Cruise and Apple (which shut down its self-driving car project earlier this year) each reported thousands of miles driven.

I’ve always had a love-hate relationship with curling my hair, and it’s been a long journey finding the best curling iron to style with. My tumultuous tryst with curling irons probably began because not only is my very naturally flat, straight hair hard to curl to begin with, but also because I’ve had my fair share of curling iron burns on various areas of my face and neck throughout my teen years (don’t ask). I hated the trial and error of learning how to curl my hair in those days, but loved how my curled hair transformed me every time, whether it was bouncy ringlets for my adolescent theater performances, rounded curls for my senior prom, or loose waves for college graduation. Never have I gone to an important milestone in my life without a curling iron—no matter how clumsy my hands were or how bulky the device was. But curling irons have come a long way since the late 2010s, and have followed me into adulthood as I test out various hair styling tools for my job as a beauty editor. Ceramic barrels, multistyling blow-dry curlers, and ion technology have ushered in easier ways to control temperature and allow for more dexterity, and are much quicker to use than their medieval counterparts of the early aughts. Here, I tested some of the best curling irons on the market to uncover which stylers rose to the top for someone like me with very hard-to-curl hair, plus which ones are best for wherever you may be in your curling iron journey, whether you have long hair, are a beginner, or just want a beachy wave. These were my favorites—and in case you were wondering, I’m happy to report that I did not burn myself with any of these!

What’s Better, Ceramic or Titanium Curling Irons? Curling irons are typically either tourmaline ceramic or titanium, and while neither is necessarily better than the other, there are a few differences to keep in mind when shopping. Ceramic irons generally take longer to heat up, and they can also distribute heat more evenly, making them suitable for thinner and finer hair types. Titanium curling irons, on the other hand, heat up very quickly and are better if your hair is thicker or coarser. You’ll want to choose either a ceramic or titanium curling iron depending on your hair type and texture. Since I have longer and thinner strands, I found that the ceramic irons I tested were a bit more suitable for me. What’s the Difference Between a Curling Iron and a Curling Wand? A curling iron typically has a safety clamp that allows you to hold the hair in place without needing both hands. Curling wands don’t have a clamp—so you’ll have to hold the tip of your hair as you curl it. Both irons and wands have their pros and cons: The safety clamp can sometimes leave a funny crimp in your hair (which I experienced while testing a handful of these), while wands unfortunately make it a lot easier to burn your fingers (which thankfully, I was able to avoid). How We Tested I tested these curling irons over a span of a few months, right before a handful of events and occasions when I wanted to add more volume and style to my look. My hair is thin and pin straight, but there’s a lot of it, so I was most excited about the irons that not only successfully curled my hard-to-curl hair, but that allowed me to do so in a short amount of time. I typically sectioned my hair in pieces from left to right. Although I did test upper and lower sectioning a few times, I found the former to be more successful for me personally because it was more comfortable for my arms and allowed me to focus on each strand of hair a bit better. And for those science buffs out there: I tested all of these on second-day hair, except for two (the Dyson Airwrap and Shark FlexStyle) that require damp hair. I usually curl about three-quarters of my hair (from midshaft to end), so I tested roughly that length for every iron I tried. I also used a heat protectant spray and set most of these (except one … more on that, later) with hairspray. This multistyler was by far the quickest and easiest to use out of all the curling irons I tested—even for someone like me, who hasn’t always been so confident using hot tools in my day. While there is a bit of a learning curve with this one (I learned the hard way that your hair really should be damp instead of wet), I somehow was able to curl (and fully dry) my hair within 25 minutes—an impressive feat for the length of my hair. I loved that this iron had a simple rotating switch at the top of the barrel to allow you to change airflow depending on what side of your hair you’re curling, and I also really liked how smooth my hair felt after curling: there were no flyaways in sight. The only thing missing from this curling iron/styler was a temperature gauge. Instead, it has a few buttons that allow you to customize the drying fan, plus a cool shot button to use at the end of styling. Although I couldn’t see the exact temp, did love the fact that it only heats up to 302 degrees Fahrenheit though, which helps minimize heat damage and is about 100 degrees less than the other curling irons I tried. I also loved that it has multiple barrel sizes, including a thicker 1.6-inch barrel and a 1.2-inch barrel to allow you to customize your curl. I opted for the thinner one, which I found gave me a little more room to wrap all of my hair. The curls were long-lasting and stayed smooth and frizz-free throughout my day. It’s certainly pricey at $600, but can easily become an integral part of your everyday haircare routine (whether you’re looking for a great blow dryer, flat-iron equivalent, or curler appropriate for normal-to-damaged hair), which makes it well worth the investment. By far the second-to-best curling iron I tested was this lightweight pick with an extra-long barrel. It certainly lives up to its name: I didn’t have to apply more than one pass to achieve silky-smooth curls. I also loved the clamp on this one because it wasn’t too heavy or bulky, and didn’t leave me with a dreaded clamp crimp. It felt comfortable in my hands and the longer barrel made it easy to wrap my long hair around it. The only thing I didn’t love about this iron was the temperature gauge, which sits at the base of the iron and has a row of circles that light up from bottom to top depending on how hot the iron gets. I didn’t love that I was unable to really gauge how hot the iron was getting, but I will say that it is very easy to control the heat distribution—whenever I moved it a notch or two down or up (by twisting the very bottom of the iron left or right), it pretty much immediately felt cooler or warmer—there was no wait time in between. This one gave me looser, voluminous curls that looked great after brushing them out, and I can definitely see myself reaching for it again for special occasions or when I’m looking to add a little volume and personality to my usually-very-flat hair. This long-barrel styler has excellent reviews; is suitable for all hair types, including naturally curly hair; and promises to give you silky, frizz-free curls thanks to its tourmaline ceramic-plated barrel. I tested this long barrel curling iron during a wedding weekend I attended earlier in the fall, and believe me when I say I was thoroughly impressed. Here’s the rub: I completely forgot hairspray during this weekend trip (oops), so I relied on this iron and dry shampoo to somehow carry me through a nearly eight-hour wedding day. I loved how quickly it heated up, and the elongated barrel made it simple to thoroughly wrap each section around it. I didn’t find myself having to participate in any upper limb gymnastics—instead, I held it up with one hand and used the other to wrap entire strands and sections around the barrel: I had plenty of room. Something else I loved about this curling iron was how strong the clamp was. I didn’t lose any pieces when curling; instead, everything stayed in place which made the whole process a lot faster. It didn’t take much to get a nice curl, and the curls themselves were smooth and flyaway-free. After setting them with an entire travel-sized dry shampoo later, the curls lasted throughout the entire wedding event, only decoiling and flattening by the very end of the night. This one also has dual-voltage, making it a great pick for international travel. Pretty impressive for no hairspray, I’d say! If you’re balling on a budget, this hair tool gets the job done but might take a few times to get the hang of. It’s rather bulky compared to the other hot tools I tested, and I felt that it gave my very hard-to-curl hair more of a wave than a curl. I’d recommend giving this one two passes if you have a similar hair type to me, and although I found the outcome to be less than impressive, it was decent if you’re looking for a little volume and wave. I did like that the heat was consistent and easy to control with this one by turning the knob at the base of the iron. I also like that it has a little lip on the underside of the iron to make sure it doesn’t slip or slide around when you put it down. I’d recommend this one if you’re not looking to invest a ton in a curling iron, or have short hair that curls easily and quickly. This high-quality curling iron gave me long-lasting, bouncy curls and heated up in a snap. The barrel itself is elongated and features a lightweight metal clamp that takes the guesswork out of holding your curl in place as the iron heats it. One of the things that stood out to me was the fact that there’s no temperature dial. I’m guessing that this choice was made to presumably make it easier to use, but I found it a little confusing. As someone who prefers to keep an eye on the temperature of my heat tools, I didn’t love the vague color-coated temperature settings that appear on the main button: It turns blue when the device is in between 300 and 320 degrees Fahrenheit, white when it’s 340 to 360 degrees, and red when it’s 380 to more than 440 degrees. Instead, I would’ve at least preferred a small screen that displays the temp in real time—I’d just like a little more insight to determine if my hair is about to burn off from high heat. Either way, I was impressed by the longevity of the curls this one gave me, and I’d recommend it if you’re looking for a durable curling iron that gives you a long-lasting finish. I love a good multitasking beauty product, so I was super excited to try this styler. Although it’s not a traditional curling iron, it comes with two different interchangeable barrels (one for the right side of your hair, one for the left), a blow dry head, and multiple brush heads to blow dry, straighten, or curl damp hair after washing and using conditioners. After giving this a whirl, I can definitely report that it blew dry my hair well, but the curls didn’t last super long. There’s definitely a learning curve with this one as well, and I think it had to do with my longer hair. I had to part my hair into really small sections to get the full section to stick to the iron. The left and right barrels also felt overly complicated, especially because they recommend clipping up the top half and curling the bottom section first and the top section second in the user guide. The issue with this is you have to switch out the barrel multiple times (one for the lower left, then again for the lower right, then again for the upper left, then again for the upper right). To make the process a little quicker, I’d recommend just sectioning out pieces and working from the left side of your head to the right side, so you only have to swap the barrel once. My long hair gets stringy and separates easily when it’s damp, so the mechanism didn’t work as well as I suspect it might if you have shorter, thicker hair that clings together more easily. Otherwise, it was one of the best hair dryers I’ve ever used and is suitable for straight and wavy hair textures, so I’ll definitely be using it again! When I tested this rotating curling iron, the first thing I wrote down was an exclamatory “cool rotating barrel!” After having used it, I still stand by that first impression. This iron does have a cool rotating barrel that makes it easy to twist your hair onto the barrel as you use it, eliminating the tedious wrapping of the hair that can take excess time. The small clamp at the bottom makes it easy to tuck an end piece of hair as the rest twists up, and I think this made it perfect for my longer hair, but it can work well on any hair length. This one is quite versatile as well, and you can achieve a few different types of curls from looser beach waves to tighter, more springy ringlets. Plus, it’s probably the prettiest iron of the bunch in a light pink and purple ombré. I will say that I definitely got more of a wave from this one than a curl, but I didn’t really mind it—the rotating iron cuts hair styling time in half, which to me is more valuable than the perfect curl. I found this hair tool the easiest to grip and handle out of the bunch, thanks to its nonslip matte material and included heat glove. It warmed rather quickly, and I found myself holding my hair onto the barrel for only around 45 seconds before it reached a nice, thick curl. I also found it to be very ergonomic generally— the iron is not too long or too short and was easy to navigate at different angles around my head when I was curling each section of hair. The only thing I didn’t love about this iron was that the base of the clamp left my hair with more of a crimp than a curl toward the top of my head. I had to go over these areas two to three more times to smooth out the crimps, which added more time to my routine. This iron is 10/10 for handling and ease of use but could use a more lightweight clamp so it doesn’t impress on the hair so intensely. If you have thick hair, this may just be the iron for you. This no-frills curling iron was my favorite out of all the curling irons I tested. The wand itself is extremely lightweight, and I had to wrap my hair around the barrel for only about 30 seconds to achieve a nice, bouncy curl. My controversial opinion on this one is that I absolutely love that it has no clamp—it was really easy for me to wind my longer, finer strands around the barrel without having to fuss or worry about it getting stuck or crimped in a clamp. Because the ceramic wand is so light, holding the ends of my hair at the tip of the iron didn’t make my arms ache or tire. Curling was quick with this one as well; I was able to do my full head in only 15 minutes, which is record-breaking for the amount of hair I have. While this one has multiple temperature settings, I liked that it didn’t get overly hot or smoking after using it with heat protectant, so I was able to avoid the dreaded singeing smell you get when you use hot tools on finer hair types. Speaking of hot tools, I first came across this curling iron for beginners when I was, in fact, a beauty beginner in my late high school days. Upon testing it again, I can’t say that it was my favorite out of the bunch, but it gets the job done if you’re looking for nice, long waves. The barrel I chose to test was the extra big one at 1.5 inches, so the curls I got reflected that: They were big, swooping, and similar to what I’d get if I went to a salon for a hair blowout. The other thing I noticed about this iron was that it seemed to take longer to heat up than the other curlers I tested, which is probably due to the fact that the barrel is thicker and bigger, so it’s something to keep in mind if you’re in a pinch and need to curl your hair quickly. You can’t really beat the price and accessibility of this one, so it’s definitely a great beginner tool if you’re just starting to learn how to curl your hair but aren’t ready to invest in a more advanced curler. If you aren’t ready to fully commit to curling your hair on the reg, but want to give it a little body, hear me out: This is one of the best curling tools to help you get there. There’s no twisting or turning involved for this one—in fact, all you have to do is section out your hair and clamp down to get bold, beachy waves or loose curls. While it’s technically more of a crimper than a curler, it gave me a bouncy texture and body that was just as long-lasting as some of the other curlers I tried. I liked this one a lot because it was super simple to use and didn’t leave me with any clamp crimps. It also comes with a neat little kickstand and has automatic shutoff, which came in handy as I had to run out to an event after using this one.

For a molecule of RNA, the world is a dangerous place. Unlike DNA, which can persist for millions of years in its remarkably stable, double-stranded form, RNA isn’t built to last—not even within the cell that made it. Unless it’s protectively tethered to a larger molecule, RNA can degrade in minutes or less. And outside a cell? Forget about it. Voracious, RNA-destroying enzymes are everywhere, secreted by all forms of life as a defense against viruses that spell out their genetic identity in RNA code. There is one way RNA can survive outside a cell unscathed: in a tiny, protective bubble. For decades, researchers have noticed cells releasing these bubbles of cell membrane, called extracellular vesicles (EVs), packed with degraded RNA, proteins, and other molecules. But these sacs were considered little more than trash bags that whisk broken-down molecular junk out of a cell during routine decluttering. Then, in the early 2000s, experiments led by Hadi Valadi, a molecular biologist at the University of Gothenburg, revealed that the RNA inside some EVs didn’t look like trash. The cocktail of RNA sequences was considerably different from those found inside the cell, and these sequences were intact and functional. When Valadi’s team exposed human cells to EVs from mouse cells, they were shocked to observe the human cells take in the RNA messages and “read” them to create functional proteins they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to make. Valadi concluded that cells were packaging strands of RNA into the vesicles specifically to communicate with one another. “If I have been outside and see that it’s raining,” he said, “I can tell you: If you go out, take an umbrella with you.” In a similar way, he suggested, a cell could warn its neighbors about exposure to a pathogen or noxious chemical before they encountered the danger themselves. Since then, a wealth of evidence has emerged supporting this theory, enabled by improvements in sequencing technology that allow scientists to detect and decode increasingly small RNA segments. Since Valadi published his experiments, other researchers have also seen EVs filled with complex RNA combinations. These RNA sequences can contain detailed information about the cell that authored them and trigger specific effects in recipient cells. The findings have led some researchers to suggest that RNA may be a molecular lingua franca that transcends traditional taxonomic boundaries and can therefore encode messages that remain intelligible across the tree of life. “RNA already has a meaning in every cell, and it’s a pretty simple code.” In 2024, new studies have exposed additional layers of this story, showing, for example, that along with bacteria and eukaryotic cells, archaea also exchange vesicle-bound RNA, which confirms that the phenomenon is universal to all three domains of life. Another study has expanded our understanding of cross-kingdom cellular communication by showing that plants and infecting fungi can use packets of havoc-wreaking RNA as a form of coevolutionary information warfare: An enemy cell reads the RNA and builds self-harming proteins with its own molecular machinery. “I’ve been in awe of what RNA can do,” said Amy Buck, an RNA biologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved with the new research. For her, understanding RNA as a means of communication “goes beyond appreciating the sophistication and the dynamic nature of RNA within the cell.” Transmitting information beyond the cell may be one of its innate roles. The microbiologist Susanne Erdmann studies viral infections in Haloferax volcanii, a single-celled organism that thrives in unbelievably salty environments such as the Dead Sea or the Great Salt Lake. Single-celled bacteria are known to exchange EVs widely, but H. volcanii is not a bacterium—it’s an archaean, a member of the third evolutionary branch of life, which features cells built differently from bacteria or eukaryotes like us. Because EVs are the same size and density as the virus particles Erdmann’s team studies at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Germany, they “always pop up when you isolate and purify viruses,” she said. Eventually, her group got curious and decided to peek at what’s inside. The microbiologist Susanne Erdmann recently found archaea enclosing RNA in cellular bubbles and dispatching it into the environment. Her discovery extended our knowledge of this messaging ability to all three domains of life. “I was expecting DNA,” Erdmann recalled, following reports that other archaeal species pack DNA into EVs. Instead, her lab found a whole smorgasbord of RNA—specifically noncoding RNAs, mysterious stretches of nucleotides with no known function in archaea. These noncoding RNA sequences were much more abundant in the EVs than in the archaeal cells themselves. “It was the first time that we found RNA in EVs in archaea,” she said. Erdmann wondered if there was a purpose to the archaean EVs. A cell can spontaneously make vesicles when its membrane pinches in on itself to form a little bubble that then detaches. However, other mechanisms involve more active and deliberate processes, similar to the ones that move molecules around inside the cell. Erdmann’s group identified an archaeal protein that was essential for producing RNA-containing EVs. That suggested to her that the RNA wasn’t ending up in the EVs by chance, and that the process wasn’t just waste disposal. “It’s very likely that [archaea] use them for cell-to-cell communication,” she said. “Why else would you invest so much energy in throwing out random RNA in vesicles?” Erdmann isn’t sure why the Haloferax microbes pack their vesicles with RNA while other archaeal species prefer DNA. But she suspects it has to do with how time sensitive the molecular message is. “RNA is a different language than DNA,” she said, and it serves a fundamentally different purpose both inside and outside cells. An organism’s DNA should be stable and relatively unchanging over the course of its life. It may pick up spontaneous mutations or even extra genes, but it takes generations of natural selection for temporary changes in DNA sequences to take hold in a population. RNA, on the other hand, is constantly in flux, responding to dynamic conditions inside and outside the cell. RNA signals don’t last long, but they don’t need to, since they can so quickly become irrelevant. As a message, RNA is transient. This is a feature, not a bug: It can have only short-term effects on other cells before it degrades. And since the RNA inside a cell is constantly changing, “the message that you can send to your neighboring cell” can also change very quickly, Erdmann said. In that sense, it’s more like a quick text message or email meant to communicate timely information than, say, runes etched in stone or a formal memo on letterhead. While it seems that neighboring archaea are taking up and internalizing EVs from their fellow cells, it’s not clear yet whether the messages affect them. Erdmann is also already wondering what happens to these vesicles in the wild, where many different organisms could be within earshot of the messages they carry. “How many other different organisms in the same environment could take up this message?” she asked. “And do they just eat it and use the RNA as food, or do they actually detect the signal?” While that may still be a mystery for Haloferax, other researchers have demonstrated that cells across species, kingdoms and even domains of life can send and receive remarkably pointed molecular missives. Although RNA is short-lived, it has revealed itself to be a shape-shifting molecular marvel. It’s best known for helping cells produce new proteins by copying DNA instructions (as messenger RNA, or mRNA) and delivering them to the ribosome for construction. However, its flexible backbone lets RNA fold into a number of shapes that can impact cell biology. It can act as an enzyme to accelerate chemical reactions within cells. It can bind to DNA to activate or silence the expression of genes. And competing strands of RNA can tangle up mRNA instructions in a process called RNA interference that prevents the production of new proteins. Over the past decade, the molecular geneticist Hailing Jin has built a body of work showing that warring organisms from two kingdoms of life—a plant and a fungus—exchange RNA in a form of informational warfare, with real biological effects. As researchers increasingly appreciate the ways RNA changes cell activity, they’ve studied strategies to use this mutable little molecule as an experimental tool, a disease treatment, and even the basis for the Covid-19 mRNA vaccine. All of these applications require transferring RNA into cells, but it seems that evolution has beaten us to it: EVs transmit RNA even to cells that may not want to get the message. About 10 years ago, the molecular geneticist Hailing Jin and her lab at the University of California, Riverside discovered that two organisms from different kingdoms—a plant and a fungus—exchange RNA as a form of warfare. Jin was studying Botrytis cinerea, a fuzzy gray mold that ravages crops such as strawberries and tomatoes, when she saw it swap RNA with the plant Arabidopsis (thale-cress) during infection. The Botrytis fungus delivered RNA that interfered with the plant’s ability to fight the infection. Later work showed that the plant cells could respond with their own volley of RNA that damaged the fungus. In this “coevolutionary arms race,” as Jin described it, both organisms used EVs as vehicles for these delicate but damaging RNA messages. Previously, scientists interested in host-pathogen dynamics mainly focused on proteins and metabolites, Jin said, because those molecules can be easier to study. But it makes sense for organisms to have multiple ways of resisting environmental challenges, she said, including using RNA to interact with distant evolutionary relatives. Over the past decade, more scientists have discovered examples of cross-kingdom RNA exchange as an offensive strategy during infection. Parasitic worms living in mouse intestines release RNA in EVs that shut down the host’s defensive immune proteins. Bacteria can shoot messages to human cells that tamp down antibacterial immune responses. The fungus Candida albicans has even learned to twist a message from human EVs to its own advantage: It uses human RNA to promote its own growth. Cross-kingdom correspondence isn’t always hate mail. These interactions have also been seen in friendly (or neutral) relationships, Jin said. For example, bacteria that live symbiotically in the roots of legumes send RNA messages to promote nodulation—the growth of little bumps where the bacteria live and fix nitrogen for the plant. How can RNA from one branch of the tree of life be understood by organisms on another? It’s a common language, Buck said. RNA has most likely been around since the very beginning of life. While organisms have evolved and diversified, their RNA-reading machinery has largely stayed the same. “RNA already has a meaning in every cell,” Buck said. “And it’s a pretty simple code.” So simple, in fact, that a recipient cell can open and interpret the message before realizing it could be dangerous, the way we might instinctively click a link in an email before noticing the sender’s suspicious address. Indeed, earlier this year, Jin’s lab showed that Arabidopsis plant cells can send seemingly innocuous RNA instructions that have a surprise impact on an enemy fungus. In experiments, Jin’s team saw the Botrytis fungus read the invading mRNA along with its own molecules and unwittingly create proteins that damaged its infectious abilities. It’s almost as if the plants were creating a “pseudo-virus,” Jin said—little packets of RNA that infect a cell and then use that cell’s machinery to churn out proteins. “This is a pretty powerful mechanism,” she said. “One mRNA can be translated into many, many copies of proteins … It’s much more effective than transporting the protein itself.” To her knowledge, Jin said, this is the first time she’s seen evidence of organisms across kingdoms exchanging mRNA messages and reading them into proteins. But she thinks it’s likely to be seen in lots of other systems, once people start looking for it. The field feels young, Buck said, which is exciting. There’s still a lot to learn: for example, whether the other molecules packaged in EVs help deliver the RNA message. “It’s a fun challenge to unravel all of that,” she said. “We should be inspired with how incredibly powerful and dynamic RNA is, and how we’re still discovering all the ways that it shapes and regulates life.” Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.

            "content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. For a while now, companies like OpenAI and Google have been touting advanced \"reasoning\" capabilities as the next big step in their latest artificial intelligence models. Now, though, a new study from six Apple engineers shows that the mathematical \"reasoning\" displayed by advanced large language models can be extremely brittle and unreliable in the face of seemingly trivial changes to common benchmark problems. The fragility highlighted in these new results helps support previous research suggesting that LLMs' use of probabilistic pattern matching is missing the formal understanding of underlying concepts needed for truly reliable mathematical reasoning capabilities. \"Current LLMs are not capable of genuine logical reasoning,\" the researchers hypothesize based on these results. \"Instead, they attempt to replicate the reasoning steps observed in their training data.\" In \"GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models\"—currently available as a preprint paper—the six Apple researchers start with GSM8K's standardized set of more than 8,000 grade-school level mathematical word problems, which is often used as a benchmark for modern LLMs' complex reasoning capabilities. They then take the novel approach of modifying a portion of that testing set to dynamically replace certain names and numbers with new values—so a question about Sophie getting 31 building blocks for her nephew in GSM8K could become a question about Bill getting 19 building blocks for his brother in the new GSM-Symbolic evaluation. This story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast. This approach helps avoid any potential \"data contamination\" that can result from the static GSM8K questions being fed directly into an AI model's training data. At the same time, these incidental changes don't alter the actual difficulty of the inherent mathematical reasoning at all, meaning models should theoretically perform just as well when tested on GSM-Symbolic as GSM8K. Instead, when the researchers tested more than 20 state-of-the-art LLMs on GSM-Symbolic, they found average accuracy reduced across the board compared to GSM8K, with performance drops between 0.3 percent and 9.2 percent, depending on the model. The results also showed high variance across 50 separate runs of GSM-Symbolic with different names and values. Gaps of up to 15 percent accuracy between the best and worst runs were common within a single model and, for some reason, changing the numbers tended to result in worse accuracy than changing the names. This kind of variance—both within different GSM-Symbolic runs and compared to GSM8K results—is more than a little surprising since, as the researchers point out, \"the overall reasoning steps needed to solve a question remain the same.\" The fact that such small changes lead to such variable results suggests to the researchers that these models are not doing any \"formal\" reasoning but are instead “attempt[ing] to perform a kind of in-distribution pattern-matching, aligning given questions and solution steps with similar ones seen in the training data.” Still, the overall variance shown for the GSM-Symbolic tests was often relatively small in the grand scheme of things. OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o, for instance, dropped from 95.2 percent accuracy on GSM8K to a still-impressive 94.9 percent on GSM-Symbolic. That's a pretty high success rate using either benchmark, regardless of whether or not the model itself is using \"formal\" reasoning behind the scenes (though total accuracy for many models dropped precipitously when the researchers added just one or two additional logical steps to the problems). The tested LLMs fared much worse, though, when the Apple researchers modified the GSM-Symbolic benchmark by adding \"seemingly relevant but ultimately inconsequential statements\" to the questions. For this \"GSM-NoOp\" benchmark set (short for \"no operation\"), a question about how many kiwis someone picks across multiple days might be modified to include the incidental detail that \"five of them [the kiwis] were a bit smaller than average.\" Adding in these red herrings led to what the researchers termed \"catastrophic performance drops\" in accuracy compared to GSM8K, ranging from 17.5 percent to a whopping 65.7 percent, depending on the model tested. These massive drops in accuracy highlight the inherent limits in using simple \"pattern matching\" to \"convert statements to operations without truly understanding their meaning,\" the researchers write. In the example with the smaller kiwis, for instance, most models try to subtract the smaller fruits from the final total because, the researchers surmise, \"their training datasets included similar examples that required conversion to subtraction operations.\" This is the kind of \"critical flaw\" that the researchers say \"suggests deeper issues in [the models'] reasoning processes\" that can't be helped with fine-tuning or other refinements. The results of this new GSM-Symbolic paper aren't completely new in the world of AI research. Other recent papers have similarly suggested that LLMs don't actually perform formal reasoning and instead mimic it with probabilistic pattern-matching of the closest similar data seen in their vast training sets. Still, the new research highlights just how fragile this kind of mimicry can be when the prompt in question pushes it in a direction that doesn't precisely match any training data. It also highlights the inherent limitations in trying to perform high-level reasoning without any underlying model of the logic or world behind it. As Ars' Benj Edwards put it in a July story about AI video generation: One of the reasons OpenAI's GPT-4 turned heads in text synthesis is that the model finally reached a size where it was large enough to have absorbed enough information (in training data) to give the impression that it might be able to genuinely understand and model the world when, in reality, a key aspect of its success is that it \"knows\" far more than most humans and can impress us by combining those existing concepts in novel ways. With enough training data and computation, the AI industry will likely reach what you might call \"the illusion of understanding\" with AI video synthesis eventually … We're likely seeing a similar \"illusion of understanding\" with AI's latest \"reasoning\" models, and seeing how that illusion can break when the model runs in to unexpected situations. AI expert Gary Marcus, in his analysis of the new GSM-Symbolic paper, argues that the next big leap in AI capability will only come when these neural networks can integrate true \"symbol manipulation, in which some knowledge is represented truly abstractly in terms of variables and operations over those variables, much as we see in algebra and traditional computer programming … \" Until then, we're going to get the kind of brittle \"reasoning\" that can lead AI models to fail mathematical tests in ways that calculators never do.

This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED My life changed after getting better bedding. I'm sleeping better thanks to sheets that keep me cool at night, and my back pain was erased after getting a more supportive mattress. If you aren't sleeping well, I'm here to tell you that it can be fixed. It can cost a pretty penny, though, which is why sale events for mattresses and bedding are so exciting. A little savings can go a long way to making better sleep something all of us can afford, and make it easier to splurge on the upgrades you really need for better sleep. While Amazon Prime Day isn't usually popular for bedding—you probably think of things like Wi-Fi routers and TVs, both of which are on sale—there are a surprising number of mattresses, sheets, and even pillow sales happening right now. We've vetted every sale we could find that featured a product we recommend, and rounded up the best ones to shop for Amazon's very own holiday, which ends tonight. All prices are for queen sizes.

Birch is also running a Fall Into Bed Sale from now until October 7, just like Helix, and has 20 percent off sitewide with the code FALLSALE20. However, Birch's sale includes two free pillows with every mattress purchase, making it a better deal. It is the brand's discontinued Eco-Rest pillows, though, rather than any of the newer options. It's not as good a sale as we saw during Labor Day or other summer sales, but Birch's mattresses and mattress toppers are ones we seriously love. Leesa makes great mattresses—its Sapira Chill is one of the few to rival our longtime favorites, and the Leesa Legend Chill is one of the best cooling mattresses we've tried. Leesa is running a Fall into Savings Sale for the majority of the month, with 20 percent off select mattresses (plus two free pillows) and 25 percent off bedding and bases. All of our favorite models managed to make the cut for the sale. Casper's well known for kick-starting the mattress-in-a-box style of shopping we've come to know and love. The brand recently redesigned its entire line, and the new base model, the One, has become a quick favorite of ours for its breathable, squishy design that still manages a medium-firm feel. Casper also makes our favorite pillow, the Hybrid Snow. Casper has the pillow on sale on Amazon for Prime Day, but it has the mattress and a better pillow deal (20 percent off if you're buying more than two, but just one pillow will be 10 percent off, same as Amazon) on its own site, where it's running the Casper Friends & Family sale. The sale starts today but will run until October 23. Brooklyn Bedding makes a great array of firm mattresses, like the Plank and Plank Natural. We love these models, especially since they're flippable with a firm and medium-firm side on each. The Planks aren’t the only ones we like, either—the Aurora Luxe Cooling Mattress is a nice in-between if you want something firm-ish, and it has a pillow top you can add on (great for side sleepers!) All three mattresses are on sale right now for 30 percent off with the code FLASH30, which is a good discount. Tempur-Pedic is running a sale all of October on a handful of mattress toppers, pillows, and the Tempur-Cloud mattress. We haven't tested the Tempur-Cloud or Tempur-Pedic's pillows yet, but our editors are fans of the Tempur-Adapt Topper that's 40 percent off right now with the code TOPPERS40. Our editor says the Tempur-Adapt has been great to pair with an extra firm mattress to make it nice and soft, and has good cooling technology built into the layers. It'll be featured in our upcoming guide to mattress toppers. It's assumed that most mattress shoppers are selecting between soft and firm, or trying to find a middle ground acceptable to partners with different preferences. But what if your tastes change with the seasons or how achy your muscles are after a long, active day? Saatva's Zenhaven organic mattress lets you choose a side. Start soft and find it hurts your back? No worries, just flip to the firm side, or vice versa. Turmerry makes some of our favorite organic mattresses and toppers and the company is running a Prime Day sale of 15 percent off sitewide. Use the code PRIME to get the deal. Buffy's been running a 20 percent off sale for the past few weeks on its site and plans to continue the sale through Amazon Prime Day. While it's not a new sale, it's still a chance to get some of our team's favorite sleep gear at a better price than usual. Our team loves both their Breeze and Cloud comforters for how breathable and comfortable they are all year long, and their sheets have been mainstay picks in our sheets guide. They're also making eco-friendly materials choices, using things like lyocell Tencel and fabric made from plastic bottles to make their bedding. Cozy Earth is known for its super soft sheets and even hoodies, and the company is running an on-site sale the same time as Amazon Prime Day. Cozy Earth's Cozy Days sale has everything 30 percent off, but with the code WIRED you can get 35 percent off the entire site. Cozy Earth has some things for sale on Amazon too, but the sale is better on Cozy Earth's own site. There are a lot of great things to love at Brooklinen, and good news: Its entire Amazon storefront is 20 percent off. Brooklinen runs a lot of sales, but these are still good prices, since usually Brooklinen runs 15 percent off sales. We're fans of lots of sheets from Brooklinen (especially its percale, organic cotton, and sateen), and its towels are fantastic too. You'll need to click the coupon to get the 20 percent off on Amazon, and you won't see the updated price until you're in the last stage of your cart. Brooklinen will also run some flash sales over the next two days, so keep an eye out for those too. Avocado's Autumn Slumber Sale is running from now until mid-October, and while we like both Avocado's mattresses (the Avocado Green is our favorite organic mattress), the sale is better in the sheets department than the mattresses. WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson recommends both Avocado's organic cotton and linen sheet sets, but the linen is currently out of stock. Not all sales are great deals, unfortunately (though it's not to say it's a terrible price!). Here are some of the live sales we've vetted so far. Helix has kick-started October sale season already with its Fall Into Bed Sale that runs all month, but for the next two days it's running the Deal Day Sale, with 25 percent off everything on its site with the code PRIMETIME25. It's a price we often see and what we recommend buying it for, but not a great sale price, since you can often find it around this price. Still, Helix makes some of our favorite mattresses, so it's a good chance to grab these at the ideal price point. Bear, the maker of our favorite side sleeper mattress, is also running a sale during Prime Day. It's got 35 percent off sitewide with the code PRIME, plus two free pillows with any mattress purchase. It brings the mattress to the price we usually see it available for, though the $150 worth of pillows makes it a bit of a discount. Nolah already started off October with its Fall Sale, and now the Prime Sale for the next two days has the same discount: 35 percent off everything on the site, plus two free pillows with any mattress purchase. The 35 percent off gets it to the price we usually see for it, but the added pillows make it a bit of a deal. The Nolah Fluffy Pillows are a pillow you can only get with a mattress purchase, but there's no set price to see how much added value you're getting. It's the price we normally recommend buying this mattress for. Nectar's Flash Sale starts today and runs until October 14, so you have a little extra time with this one beyond Prime Day. You can get up to 50 percent off mattresses, plus $100 off any mattress above $1,000 including the Nectar Luxe. That promo brings the price on a queen to $1,149. This is our longtime pick for pressure relief and was recently redesigned. The new version, which we are currently testing, is even better for pressure relief than the old version. It's a great pick for side sleepers who want something on the softer side or anyone who wants to feel like they're floating.

You've come to the right place. A good-quality hair tool can not only make short work of your morning routine, it's usually better for your hair, too. Unfortunately, some of the more popular high-end appliances can run anywhere from $100 up to almost $700, so events like Amazon Prime Day—happening for a second time in 2024 on October 8 and 9—are some of the best times of the year to grab one for yourself or for a gift. Each tool listed here has been vetted for our Best Hair Straighteners, Best Hair Dryers, and Best Curling Irons guides and deemed worthy of purchase by our Gear team of testers, as well as tracked over the previous weeks to ensure the sale is a legitimate one.

As I describe in our Best Hair Straighteners guide, this is one of the only flat irons I’ve ever tried that can straighten my difficult curls in a single pass and keep them that way. The titanium plates—which heat up in around 23 seconds to 450 degrees Fahrenheit—feature a small inlaid infrared strip, which Sutra says helps to seal the hair cuticle. This is the first time I’ve seen this iron on sale, so it’s a great buy if you have thick, unruly hair like I do and are ready for an iron that can take care of business in just a pass or two. Just make sure you also pick up a heat protectant if you don’t already have one—we recommend Curlsmith Miracle Shield. If you have straight or wavy hair and already know a blow-dryer brush works for your texture, Shark's FlexStyle is a worthy upgrade that combines a hair dryer, two brushes, and two auto-wrap hair curlers in one—designed to cut a significant amount of time and storage space. It may seem pricey, but as our Gear Team testers mention in our Best Hair Straighteners guide, this is basically a perfect dupe of the enduringly popular Dyson Airwap multi-styler (see below), which is twice the price—making the highly rated FlexStyle an even better deal at its sale price of $235. The Tymo Airflow is a great hair straightener that can double as a curler, too, thanks to the rounded barrel. I like a smooth undercurl when I straighten my hair, and the Tymo Airflow is perfect to achieve that for me. I’ve especially loved using it with short hair, but it worked well for my long hair too. The heat settings range from 284 degrees to 428 degrees Fahrenheit, and Tymo includes a little guide on which heat setting to use based on your hair type. While it looks more like a curler, it performs best as a straightener. It did give my hair some soft curls when I used it curling-iron style, though. —Nena Farrell T3 SinglePass Smooth X One of the better Prime Day hair deals, this icy-pink straightener not only looks stylish, its plates are longer (4½ inches, compared with the 4 inches on most irons) but still narrow at 1 inch, allowing for more surface area without sacrificing maneuverability. Nine heat settings with an internal microchip to control fluctuations and a special finish to add shine round out the features. I didn't have a ton of success using this on my curls, but my mom has fine waves and this is her favorite flat iron. The StyleMax has a number of factors that are similar to its sibling above, like the same rose-gold accents and proprietary CeraGloss plates. It does have a much wider range of temperature control options, which is great if you have fine or delicate hair and are especially worried about damage. Just be sure to keep the manual so you can make sure you know what, er, all of the lights mean.—Adrienne So My favorite flat iron for touch-ups, this was the top overall pick in our Best Hair Straighteners guide. The 1-inch ceramic plates top out at 410 degrees Fahrenheit, and the compact body is easy to maneuver in the event you want to add some waves. If you want a higher-end straightener but are put off by the idea of spending upwards of $150, this is both a great iron and a great deal at under $100. This Chi is not only a perpetual Amazon bestseller, it's beloved by both former WIRED contributor Victoria Woollaston-Webber and myself. I had one for more than a decade, and it somehow still made short work of my 3a curls, despite its max temperature being only 392 degrees Fahrenheit. If you've been working with $20 drugstore models, as I myself did during much of my twenties, this is a worthy investment and excellent entry into the world of more upscale hair straighteners. I’ve been using Dyson’s Airstrait (8/10, WIRED Recommends) exclusively on my hair for over a year now. It has the same form factor as a standard flat iron, but it uses airflow to dry and straighten your hair simultaneously instead of hot plates. You can also pick between two main styling modes (wet and dry) as well as three temperature settings. Whenever I wash my hair, I’ll set it to wet mode to fully dry it and then switch to dry mode to flatten out any puffiness. It’s allowed me to cut my full hair routine from 45 minutes to 15 minutes. —Brenda Stolyar This straightener is expensive, but it's a great option if you're worried about hair damage. It comes with a proprietary temperature-finding feature called HeatID Technology. On the iron's handle, you can select your hair features, length, and whether your hair is color-treated. It will then suggest the appropriate heat level to straighten your hair. We also love the Refresh mode feature, which touches up your hair at a lower temperature based on previous settings. —Brenda Stolyar The Double Straight is a bit unique since it has a four-plate design. The first two plates straighten your hair, while the second two “reinforce” the style. This allows you to make two passes simultaneously, which reduces the time it takes to style your hair and the risk of heat damage. It also comes with the most temperature settings of any straighteners we've tested—you'll have 10 to choose from, ranging from 85 degrees Fahrenheit (140 Celsius) up to 455 degrees Fahrenheit (235 Celsius). —Brenda Stolyar Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano was quite impressed by this dryer, which is more powerful than it looks and folds up small enough to fit in a purse. Though she didn't love using it on her curly hair, as she points out in our guide to Best Hair Dryers, she still thought it was perfect for those with straight or wavy hair, or as a travel dryer. As featured in our guide to Best Hair Dryers, this compact dryer features accessories that magnetically attach to the dryer body, including a comb and a diffuser for styling curly hair, plus a handy digital display on the back that shows the exact temperature. In fact, the only downside our tester could find was the price, so this is a great grab at $60 off. Even though former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano points out (not incorrectly) that everything about the Bed Head brand screams ’90s, she liked this purple-and-neon-yellow hair dryer for its ability to dry her curls without disrupting their pattern. She also liked that it was lightweight with an unusually large 4-inch-wide mouth. Granted, $4 off isn’t exactly a groundbreaking sale, but if you’re looking for an inexpensive hair dryer specifically for curls, this is a decent option. T3 is a popular brand in the hair tool space for good reason, and this white-and-rose gold ionic hairdryer was one of our top picks in our Best Hair Dryers guide. The Gear team testers loved how it felt lightweight and effortless to use, and the fact that it comes with its own flat and round brushes for styling makes this an even more impressive deal than it already is. T3's Featherweight StyleMax really is lightweight—my arms don't ache as I dry my hair with this one. It's made of plastic to keep it lightweight, but it doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. It also comes with a nice set of attachments, including a diffuser that I love using, plus two concentrators and a smoothing comb. It's a great blow dryer if you alternate between diffusing your hair and doing a classic blowout. —Nena Farrell Many people with curly hair are familiar with diffusers that attach to hair dryers, but they may not have seen a hair dryer that itself is actually shaped like a diffuser—this unique tool combines them both in one trendy-looking gold package. Despite the Diffon’s having no handle, former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano describes it as being comfortable to use, and in our Best Hair Dryers guide, she said it styled her curls well without adding frizz or puffiness. The gentle airflow settings may take some extra time to dry thick or voluminous hair, as was the case for Medea, but this could be an excellent solution for those with thinner or finer hair, especially if it’s on sale. This is one of our favorite hair dryers for reducing frizz. It comes with two air concentrator nozzles that help distribute heat and airflow, so it doesn't overdry the hair. Instead, the attachments help to create a shiny and smooth look. The hottest heat setting doesn't feel like it's burning your scalp either. —Brenda Stolyar We love this curling iron for its versatility. In addition to the styler handle, it comes with three attachments, including a 0.5-inch barrel for tight, defined curls; a 1.25-inch barrel for soft, natural curls; and a 1.5-inch barrel for larger curls and waves (which comes with a clip to help keep hair in place). Although you can pick a specific temperature, it does come with nine different heat settings that range from 260° to 410° Fahrenheit. It's a great option for a variety of hair types and is super easy to use.—Brenda Stolyar As our tester notes in our guide to Best Curling Irons, this budget iron is infused with argan oil and keratin for extra shine. We also appreciated the inclusion of a heat glove, as well as a tapered barrel, 10 heat settings with a digital display, and longer handle for added maneuverability. It comes in three sizes, but for larger, looser curls and waves, our tester recommends the 1-1.5 inch size.—Brenda Stolyar We recommend this one for long-lasting curls. With a 1-inch ceramic barrel, it's small enough for short hairstyles but large enough for creating curls in longer, thicker hair. The clamp and easy-to-use handle also keep the hair in place as you twist it and the cool tip is larger than other curlers we've tried. It's tapered too, which helps you know how close you are to the hot metal barrel while creating curls—if your fingers are on the thin end, you're further away; grabbing the thicker end means you have a higher risk of accidentally burning yourself.—Brenda Stolyar The Dyson Airwrap (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the multi-tool that can do it all—a simple wand that comes with six attachments ranging from different-sized curling barrels to brushes. It creates a vortex of air (called the Coanda effect) to draw hair to the wand for effortless drying, smoothing, and curling. Our reviewer loved how it cut down the time she spent on her styling routine. Though the Airwrap is notoriously expensive, this is a legitimate sale, so if you've been on the fence, this might be a good time to try it out.—Brenda Stolyar Tymo Ring Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano likens this trendy 2-in-1 styling tool to a combination hot comb and straightening iron, saying the idea is for users to be able to get closer to their roots without burning themselves than they otherwise would with a classic hot comb. It may not be the best option for those with super-curly hair, as Medea still had to use a flat iron afterward, but people with easier-to-straighten hair who are worried about the potential damage inflicted by traditional flat irons might do well to give this one a try while it’s on sale. Blow-dry brushes have become my holy grail product since becoming the mom of a toddler. Whether my hair was long or short, I found myself grabbing a blow dry brush to help dry my hair and style it enough to resume wrangling my kiddo. My favorite so far is the T3 AireBrush Round, which has a 2.5-inch brush that's small enough for my short hair and can get it dry and styled in a matter of minutes. There are three different heat settings (I like the coolest setting for my fine hair) and two speed settings to use. It's a great brush I find myself grabbing on days I want a blowout. There’s also an oval version that’s on sale too if you prefer the hairbrush shape over the round. —Nena Farrell For those with easy-to-straighten hair who can create sleek styles with just a blow dryer, this budget blow-dry brush is recommended in our Best Hair Straighteners guide as a way to revive second-day hair. It’s a classic round (well, oval in this case) brush with the hair dryer built right in—you can save a step in your blowout process for less than half the price of more popular models. If you’ve been wanting to try a blow-dry brush but aren’t ready to commit to shelling out for one of the trendier, more expensive models, this is the perfect chance to see if it’s the tool for you. On the scale of intimidating hair tools, this one admittedly ranks near the top. Clamping a giant waffle iron-looking contraption close to your scalp? Clips? Mysterious sizzling noises? However, if you want to add first-day volume back into second-, third-, or even fourth-day (don’t judge) hair, this is the way to do it. Though Voloom insists throughout its literature that it’s not a crimping iron, it does work in much the same way, just with a proprietary plate pattern designed to lift your hair off your scalp at the root. I’m honestly not sure how I lived without this thing, but it’s certainly not inexpensive at its full price—if you’ve been wanting to give it a try, today is your chance while it’s still $28 off.

Since 2011, he has published nearly 6,000 articles, from breaking news and reviews to useful how-tos. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Sonos apparently believes its mobile app has reached a good enough place to resume product launches: today the company has announced the Arc Ultra and Sub 4. The $999 Arc Ultra is a more powerful take on the original Arc, and it’s the first Sonos product to feature unique transducer technology from Mayht, a startup that Sonos acquired in 2022. Sonos refers to this as “Sound Motion” and says it allows the Arc Ultra to produce richer, even more immersive sound than the original.  The company is touting Sound Motion as “one of the most significant breakthroughs in audio engineering in nearly 100 years” and says it “unlocks greater clarity, depth, and balance than ever before possible from a soundbar this sleek.” The Arc Ultra has fourteen drivers in total — three more than the Arc — and they include seven tweeters, six midwoofers, and the built-in Sound Motion woofer. With that array of speakers, Sonos says the new soundbar is capable of delivering 9.1.4 output all on its own. The Arc Ultra should also deliver clearer dialog thanks to an “advanced version of Speech Enhancement.” It’ll support Trueplay EQ tuning — including for Android users — and also offers Bluetooth audio playback, something the original Arc lacks. Like other Sonos soundbars, the Arc Ultra can be paired with the company’s Sonos Ace headphones for private listening of audio from any input device plugged into the Ultra. Along with the new soundbar, Sonos is introducing its latest full-size subwoofer, the Sub 4, which now has a matte finish. Only a couple months ago, Sonos CEO Patrick Spence said that the company was postponing two products as it focused all efforts on improving the performance of its overhauled app for Android and iOS. Earlier this month, Sonos announced a multi-point plan to earn back customer trust and ensure that a disaster like the released-too-soon app never happens again. “We have reached a level of quality that gives us the confidence to launch our extraordinary new products,” Spence said in today’s press release. Sonos says another app update timed to the Arc Ultra’s release will supposedly help the software “surpass the performance of the previous app across important metrics.” 90 percent of the previous app’s features will have been restored with the forthcoming update, according to the company.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Abigail Bassett Honda is no stranger to pushing technology boundaries when it comes to powertrains, and the company gave us a brief drive of its new electrified platform, the Honda Zero, which made its debut at CES last year.  While we only got a short time with an early prototype and details were slim on a lot of the technology, Honda offered a few more details about how it hopes to take the company into a more electrified future, building seven models on the new platform by 2030.  But the new platform is closer than it seems. The first Honda Zero Series production vehicle, a close relative of the Saloon sedan, will debut at CES 2025.  We got a total of three laps of a closed course at Honda Global in Tochigi, Japan, which included a short acceleration run, a rising hairpin, and a series of slaloms. There were two prototype vehicles, a Honda Civic and a Honda CR-V, riding atop the Honda Zero platform, including a new battery pack and electric motors.  Beyond that, nothing we experienced in the prototypes will carry over directly into the production models, so it’s impossible to give more than just an initial impression. We were only permitted to drive the prototype once; I drove the CR-V variant. What I can say from the limited time and interaction is that the platform feels noticeably lighter than the Honda Prologue, which Honda jointly developed with GM just before scrapping their plans to develop a full lineup of affordable EVs in late 2023. The Honda Prologue is underpinned by GM’s Ultium EV architecture and closely related to the Chevy Blazer EV, which also feels significantly heavier than the prototype Honda we drove in Japan.  The new Honda Zero platform feels similar to other EV platforms on the market in terms of acceleration and handling. Because the weight is low in the floor, the prototype CR-V cornered quickly and flat as you approached the limit. The powertrain is quick and responsive, and on the short, front straight that the engineers set up for our test laps, I hit 110km (just shy of 70mph) in a relatively short distance.   I own a 2022 Honda CR-V Hybrid, and the prototype CR-V on the Honda Zero platform was a lot more tossable without a lot of body roll. It handled the quick slalom well, too.  Unfortunately, Honda was really light on details about its new “Thin, Light and Wise,” platform. The company claims that the battery pack will be “6 percent thinner… compared to the standard component/function installed in currently available production EVs.” How light, heavy, or thick that translates to is anyone’s guess.  Honda is equally cagey about the power output and capacity of the new battery, developed in partnership with LG Energy Solution, which will underpin the future Honda Zero models. Honda executives said the new battery platform would be designed for an EPA-rated range of 300 miles but declined to say anything more about how they’ll achieve that range. The company also said that it is aiming to limit battery degradation to less than 10 percent after 10 years of use, by leveraging the learnings it’s gained from driving data from 5 million Honda vehicles, most of which were hybrid vehicles.  “Thin, Light and Wise” Honda leveraged a lot of that hybrid vehicle experience to create new, more compact inverters and motors for the Zero platform, which contributes to its lightness. This technology, which Honda refers to as its e-Axle, gets a 40 percent smaller inverter than that in other commercially available EVs.  Honda wouldn’t detail any hard numbers or direct competitors they used for comparison, but it did say that there will be two motors offered with various configurations: A 180kW and a 50kW, which can make a combined max of 360kW of power.  There will be four options for the motor layouts: AWD with two 180kW motors at the front and rear; an AWD version with a 50kW at the front and 180kW at the rear; a RWD with 180kW at the rear; and a shared BEV and hybrid platform with the smaller 50kW motor at the rear.  The smaller e-Axles are laid out horizontally in the car, and the more compact inverters are right next to the motors, contributing to a lower floor height and more interior space for passengers, a design value that Honda refers to as “Man Maximum, Machine Minimum,” or the “M/M Concept.”  Honda also pioneered some production tools and techniques to offer thinner and lighter components. The company is investing in a total of six, 6,000-ton megacasting machines for battery case production.  Eventually, the massive machines will be used for body, frame, and rear module sections. Megacasting allows for split casting so that the company can build battery packs for sedans and large SUVs using the same machine. They join the battery case parts using friction stir welding, which both improves the connection of the weld and allows for a lower height for the battery pack.  The company is also leveraging its own Constant DC Chopping (CDC) technology to join thin and thick materials to keep the frame weight down while still offering high tensile strength for safety. These manufacturing techniques will eventually roll out to the entire Honda line (including ICE vehicles), and Honda says that they will help the entire fleet lighten up by about 20 percent.  Honda showed off some of its UX software, which still feels very much like it’s in its development stage. These experiences include everything from being able to virtually join a drive taking place elsewhere in the world via VR headset to “autonomous” driving and facial recognition and AI tools.  We got a glimpse of the VR technology when a fellow journalist put on a headset and virtually joined a drive happening in Yokohama. Honda says that they plan to release the app that enables this feature and get customer feedback sometime before the launch of the upcoming Saloon, though details were sketchy.  Honda also plans to use features like AI and facial recognition with customers. While companies like Genesis have facial recognition, Honda is pushing the envelope further by leveraging machine learning and AI to determine intent.   “Man Maximum, Machine Minimum” Honda is working on Level 3 automated driver-assistance systems that will allow for eyes-off operation in traffic. The system will rely on lidar and high-definition cameras as well as a blend of Honda’s original AI technology and Helm.ai, a platform geared toward understanding the world the same way a human would. Honda says that the Saloon, which may get another name when it debuts next year, will be a limited-run, top-line vehicle, but it won’t fall under its premium brand, Acura.  The production version will be “closely related” to the concept, according to the company. Honda is also partnered with Sony for the latter’s upcoming Afeela EV. Both the Honda Zero Saloon and the Afeela EV will be 2026 models.  Without a lot of concrete details, Honda still has a lot of wiggle room on what the new Saloon will actually offer. At the very least, it will be more than zero.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Microsoft is holding a technical alpha later this month for the upcoming Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 release. The technical alpha will be held over an unspecified weekend in October to test the game’s core services ahead of its debut on November 19th. Participants in the test phase will need a capable PC gaming rig to try out Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 before its release, as this alpha test won’t be available to Xbox players. Free flight and a limited amount of career, challenges, and discovery will be accessible during the technical alpha, alongside a limited number of aircraft. “The technical alpha has been designed to gather feedback on specific areas and features, and the scope of what is available is limited,” says the Microsoft Flight Simulator team. You can sign up for the alpha test here.  The current version of Microsoft Flight Simulator is already a demanding game on PC, and this 2024 edition looks set to raise the PC requirements even further. The recommended specs include 32GB of RAM, an Intel Core i7-10700K, and an RTX 2080. Ideally though, Microsoft says you’ll want up to 64GB of RAM, an RTX 4080, and an Intel Core i7-14700K if you want to play at max settings. Once Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 releases next month, you’ll be able to fly an air ambulance, be part of a mountain rescue team, or act as search and rescue. There’s even VIP charter services, skydive aviation, air racing, and hot air balloon trips. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is also getting smaller, with the install size reduced to around 30GB. Microsoft is using its latest cloud streaming technology to stream high detailed areas on a flight path, reducing the amount that needs to be preinstalled. Testing this cloud streaming technology is a big part of the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 technical alpha later this month.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Threshold Care’s new Motion Wi-Fi Sensing Plugs can help caregivers monitor older adults, like aging parents, in a noninvasive way that maintains the privacy of everyone in the home.  Its built-in Wi-Fi sensing technology measures physical interference with Wi-Fi signals to enable real-time monitoring of “movement without capturing images or photos.”  Wi-Fi sensing technology has been kicked around for a few years. It was part of a motion-sensing security feature built into Linksys Velop routers a few years ago, and Signify also uses the tech for its Wiz lightbulbs that turn on when you enter a room — and off when you leave.  The Motion plugs are available in a three-pack for $59.99, so you can place them “throughout the home to create a comprehensive motion zone” as they communicate with your existing Wi-Fi router. The company describes it as a “plug and play” setup, without relying on wearable devices that might need batteries or paid subscription services for ongoing monitoring.  Monitoring motion can allow a caregiver to know that someone is up and moving around in the morning, whereas no motion could indicate there’s a problem. Similarly, motion at odd times, such as in the middle of the night, could alert them to an issue. Threshold lets you monitor motion patterns and access up to two weeks of motion data in the app (iOS and Android). One thing it lacks, however, is actual “smart plug” capabilities that would allow you to turn a device plugged into it on or off. They have passthrough AC outlets, but at launch, that’s it. Threshold’s website says it has other features in development, such as a “Circle of Care” due this month that manages shared access to the system and customizable notifications that it expects to deliver in November.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled a new electric vehicle dedicated to self-driving, a possible milestone after years of false promises and blown deadlines.  The robotaxi is a purpose-built autonomous vehicle, lacking a steering wheel or pedals, meaning it will need approval from regulators before going into production. The design was futuristic, with doors that open upward like butterfly wings and a small cabin with only enough space for two passengers. There was no steering wheel or pedals, nor was there a plug — Musk said the vehicle charges inductively to regain power wirelessly.  Musk said that autonomous cars are expected to be 10-20 times safer than human-driven vehicles Musk said that autonomous cars are expected to be 10–20 times safer than human-driven vehicles and could cost as little as 20 cents per mile, compared to the $1 per mile for city buses.  Tesla plans to launch fully autonomous driving in Texas and California next year, with the Cybercab entering production by 2026 — although he said it could be as late as 2027. Additionally, Tesla is developing the Optimus robot, which could be available for $20,000–$30,000 and is capable of performing various tasks. “This is a very big deal,” Musk said. “It’ll save lives, a lot of lives, and prevent injuries.” Musk revealed the prototype robotaxi at Tesla’s “We, Robot” event held at the Warner Bros. film lot in Burbank, California, with a lot of nonpublic roads for the demonstration. Tesla has reportedly been mapping the area in advance of the demonstration, even though the company says it doesn’t rely on high-definition maps to power its Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver-assist feature.   Musk is attempting to steer Tesla away from its core business of making and selling EVs toward one that produces robots and AI. Tesla’s market cap is equal to almost all the other global automaker’s values combined. Much of the company’s stock price is based on Musk’s yearslong promise to solve autonomy by releasing a truly revolutionary vehicle that can drive itself anywhere it wants.  Whether Tesla’s robotaxi will accomplish that steep task is anyone’s guess. Musk has a reputation for defying the odds, but AV experts have routinely questioned Tesla’s approach to the technology, especially with regard to the company’s aggressive push for Level 2 advanced driver-assist systems like Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (Supervised).  1/11 1/11 Those features, which are not autonomous and require a driver to stay vigilant at all times, can be impressive but have also been known to make critical errors. Earlier this year, a 28-year-old motorcyclist was killed by a Tesla driver allegedly using FSD. Tesla has been forced to recall both of its driver-assist systems in the face of increased government scrutiny over the company’s autonomy claims. But Musk has a track record of coming from behind to pull off impossible victories. The Model 3 production and the early success of the Cybertruck are two recent examples of Musk defying expectations.  “Think about the cumulative time that people spend in a car” During the event, Musk pitched the idea of autonomous cars primarily as time-savers. “Think about the cumulative time that people spend in a car,” he said, “and the time they will get back that they can now spend on their books or watching a movie or doing work or whatever.” Still, Tesla is lagging behind companies like Waymo and Cruise, both of which have racked up millions of miles of on-road testing with their driverless vehicles. To be sure, robotaxis have had a bumpy rollout, with numerous incidents of blocked vehicles, traffic jams, and even a handful of injuries. Federal safety regulators are probing several major players to discern whether the technology powering these vehicles is safe or should be recalled.  The families of Tesla drivers who have been killed in crashes involving Autopilot have sued the company for wrongful death. And Musk’s tenure as head of X, formerly Twitter, has alienated many of Tesla’s progressive-leaning customers, who have watched in horror as he promotes right-wing conspiracy theories on the platform.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Jess Weatherbed, a news writer focused on creative industries, computing, and internet culture. Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews. Facebook and Instagram are testing new facial recognition tools that could help users quickly restore compromised accounts and combat fake celebrity-endorsed scams. Meta announced its plan to roll out experimental features that can scan a user’s face to verify their identity by comparing it against profile pictures on Facebook and Instagram. The first usage of these tools aim to protect both celebrities and everyday people from so-called “celeb-bait” ads that impersonate notable figures to trick users into visiting scam websites. Meta currently uses automated technology like machine learning to detect content that violates its policies but says celeb-bait can be difficult to distinguish from legitimate ads. “If our systems suspect that an ad may be a scam that contains the image of a public figure at risk for celeb-bait, we will try to use facial recognition technology to compare faces in the ad to the public figure’s Facebook and Instagram profile pictures,” Meta said in its announcement. “If we confirm a match and determine the ad is a scam, we’ll block it.” Celebrities will need a Facebook or Instagram profile to use the new facial recognition tools, but they’ve shown “promising results” for detection speed and efficacy in early testing with a small group of public figures, according to Meta. More celebrities who have been impacted by celeb-bait content will be automatically enrolled in the coming weeks, and will have the option to opt-out if they choose.  Meta’s facial recognition tools will also eventually allow Facebook and Instagram users to regain access to their locked accounts by submitting a video selfie, similar to authentication systems like Apple’s Face ID. It’s not clear when this feature will be available, but Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, says it’s “starting small” and plans to “roll out these protections more widely in the months ahead.” Meta says that uploaded selfie videos will be encrypted and “stored securely.” The company also says that facial data used for comparisons is immediately deleted and isn’t used for “any other purpose” — though it’s worth noting that Meta trains its AI models on almost everything that’s publicly posted to its platforms. Meta previously integrated facial recognition tech into Facebook to identify and tag users in photographs and videos. That feature was discontinued in 2021 after a lengthy privacy battle. The company now says its new tools have been vetted for security and privacy, and are being discussed with regulators and policymakers.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. Stellantis says it will put a “demonstration fleet” of Dodge Charger Daytonas on the road by 2026, equipped with solid-state battery technology that’s lighter, more energy-dense, and could eventually make for cheaper EVs. The company calls the demo fleet a “key next step” toward making solid-state EVs that you can actually buy. The cars will be built on its STLA Large EV platform, which is meant to underpin more than just the Chargers it’s demoing next year. If its demo is successful, there’s a chance that cars from brands like Maserati and Jeep will get the new battery tech, too. There’s probably a reason Stellantis says “solid-state battery technology” rather than simply solid-state batteries. That’s because these Chargers will use semi-solid-state batteries, which means they’re still made with liquid electrolytes too. That hybrid approach carries benefits like lighter weight and more range, but doesn’t totally obviate the fire risk of traditional lithium batteries. Factorial, which makes the batteries Stellantis will use, claims its semi-solid-state tech could push EV range up by as much as 50 percent versus today’s electric cars, and that the batteries have “drop-in compatibility with existing lithium-ion battery manufacturing infrastructure,” making them cheaper and easier to produce than switching to full solid-state tech would be.  Solid-state batteries have been hard to develop and not every company has been able to hack it. Nissan had promised it would be producing “all-solid-state” EVs by 2028, but seemed to walk that back this year. Fisker totally abandoned its own efforts to make solid-state batteries in 2021. But Volkswagen, which was to provide Fisker’s platform, recently announced that its batteries had passed an endurance test. Stellantis’ announcement is a sign of progress, and it’s not the only company making some. Hyundai is a Factorial investor, and so is Mercedes, which said it would have Factorial’s semi-solid-state batteries “in EVs on the road in 2026,” according to Reuters. Honda plans to introduce solid-state EVs in the latter half of the decade, while Toyota’s roadmap includes mass-producing solid-state batteries that enable more than 621 miles of range by 2028.  In China, IM Motor launched the L6, a semi-solid-state battery-driven EV, in April, while its sister brand, MG, announced it will unveil one in Europe next year.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Some YouTube users have observed the platform making it harder to skip ads in recent days. On Reddit, a user reported seeing black rectangles over the skip button on desktop instead of the expected countdown timer, and a few days later, Android Police reported not seeing a countdown to skip on mobile. But in statements to The Verge, YouTube says it isn’t removing the skip button — it’s just changing some elements of how ads are displayed. “YouTube is not hiding the skip button,” YouTube spokesperson Oluwa Falodun says in a statement to The Verge. “On skippable ads, the button appears after 5 seconds into playback, as always.” As for the changes, Falodun says that YouTube is “reducing elements on the ads player” so that “viewers can engage more deeply with the ad through a cleaner experience.” Users on both desktop and mobile may also see the countdown timer to skip an ad “appear as a progress bar on the bottom of the screen.” The distinction here seems to be that the skip button isn’t being removed, but it may not be presented in the same manner that it used to. While it’s reassuring that the company isn’t hiding the skip button, YouTube is actively expanding where and how you see ads. The pause screen is fair game for ads now, for example, and last year, the company removed some ad controls for creators. YouTube has also been cracking down on using ad blockers to dodge ads. Of course, perhaps the easiest way to remove ads is to pay for YouTube Premium, but the price for that keeps creeping up.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Brazil’s Polícia Federal announced the arrest of the hacker linked to a breach that leaked 2.9 billion records that included sensitive personal information, including some Social Security numbers. The data from that hack, which came to light in August, was put for sale on the dark web in April by an entity identifying themselves as USDoD.  As pointed out by BleepingComputer, according to a machine translation of the department’s press release, the hacker was linked to “two publications selling” federal police data. The hacker also boasted of disclosing the personal data of 80,000 members of the FBI’s InfraGard program, the department said.  Security researchers at Atlas have created a tool to search the leaked records and told PCMag that the leak contains about 272 million unique SSNs, along with as many as 600 million phone numbers. National Public Data and its parent company, Jerico Pictures, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this month, facing a flood of lawsuits and potential penalties over the incident. “The person under investigation must answer for the crime of hacking into a computer device, qualified by obtaining information, with an increase in the sentence for the commercialization of the data obtained,” according to the translation. The operation to arrest the hacker was called “Operation Data Breach.”  The federal police say they will continue to investigate if the hacker made any other breaches.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

I’m blown away by how small the new Mac Mini is; the old Mac Mini, which was already small, seems giant in comparison. Vjeran tells me that, in person, the smaller Mac Mini is cute but that it’s “more like a mini Mac Studio than a mini Mac Mini.” He also says there’s no way to reach the power button, which is on the underside of the computer, without lifting it up. As for the other computers, the new colors of the iMac really pop when they’re lined up together in these photos, if you ask me. And while the space black color of the MacBook Pros isn’t totally new, seeing it in these photos makes me really wish that Apple would bring it to the MacBook Air.

The company just refreshed the lineup with M3 chips this spring, but the M4 update will “likely” launch between January and March 2025, Gurman says. Both the 13-inch and 15-inch models will apparently get the M4 update, and they’ll have a similar design to the M2 MacBook Air. The potential spring launch for M4-equipped MacBook Airs means that product line won’t be part Apple’s rumored announcements for next week. With those updates, Apple is going to reveal new MacBook Pros, Mac Minis, and iMacs, Gurman says.  If you’re waiting for a new Mac Studio, though, don’t expect that imminently. The Mac Studio is currently powered by the M2 Max and M2 Ultra chips, but an M4-equipped version is now likely to arrive “after a March software release,” meaning it could happen sometime between March and June, Gurman says. Apple is also apparently working on an M4 Mac Pro, Gurman didn’t give a timeline for when that might come out. In the spring, Gurman reports that Apple is also aiming to reveal a new iPhone SE, new iPad Airs, “upgraded” iPad keyboards, and new entry-level iPads.

Just over a year ago, Epic Games laid off around 16 percent of its employees. The problem, Epic said, was its own big ideas for the future and just how expensive they were to build. “For a while now, we’ve been spending way more money than we earn,” Epic CEO Tim Sweeney wrote in an email to staff. On Tuesday, onstage at the Unreal Fest conference in Seattle, Sweeney declared that the company is now “financially sound.” The announcement kicked off a packed two-hour keynote with updates on Unreal Engine, the Unreal Editor for Fortnite, the Epic Games Store, and more. In an interview with The Verge, Sweeney says that reining in Epic’s spending was part of what brought the company to this point. “Last year, before Unreal Fest, we were spending about a billion dollars a year more than we were making,” Sweeney says. “Now, we’re spending a bit more than we’re making.” “The real power will come when we bring these two worlds together” Sweeney says the company is well set up for the future, too, and that it has the ability to make the types of long-term bets he spent the conference describing. “We have a very, very long runway comparing our savings in the bank to our expenditure,” ​​Sweeney says. “We have a very robust amount of funding relative to pretty much any company in the industry and are making forward investments really judiciously that we could throttle up or down as our fortunes change. We feel we’re in a perfect position to execute for the rest of this decade and achieve all of our plans at our size.” Epic has ambitious plans. Right now, Epic offers both Unreal Engine, its high-end game development tools, and Unreal Editor for Fortnite, which is designed to be simpler to use. What it’s building toward is a new version of Unreal Engine that can tie them together. “The real power will come when we bring these two worlds together so we have the entire power of our high-end game engine merged with the ease of use that we put together in [Unreal Editor for Fortnite],” Sweeney says. “That’s going to take several years. And when that process is complete, that will be Unreal Engine 6.” Unreal Engine 6 is meant to let developers “build an app once and then deploy it as a standalone game for any platform,” Sweeney says. Developers will be able to deploy the work that they do into Fortnite or other games that “choose to use this technology base,” which would allow for interoperable content. The upcoming “persistent universe” Epic is building with Disney is an example of the vision. “We announced that we’re working with Disney to build a Disney ecosystem that’s theirs, but it fully interoperates with the Fortnite ecosystem,” Sweeney says. “And what we’re talking about with Unreal Engine 6 is the technology base that’s going to make that possible for everybody. Triple-A game developers to indie game developers to Fortnite creators achieving that same sort of thing.” If you read my colleague Andrew Webster’s interview with Sweeney from March 2023, the idea of interoperability to make the metaverse work will seem familiar. At Unreal Fest this week, I got a better picture of how the mechanics of that might work with things like Unreal Engine 6 and the company’s soon-to-open Fab marketplace to shop for digital assets. Fab will be able to host assets that can work in Minecraft or Roblox, Sweeney says. But the bigger goal is to let Fab creators offer “one logical asset that has different file formats that work in different contexts.” He gave an example of how a user might buy a forest mesh set that has different content optimized for Unreal Engine, Unity, Roblox, and Minecraft. “Having seamless movement of content from place to place is going to be one of the critical things that makes the metaverse work without duplication.” But for an interoperable metaverse to really be possible, companies like Epic, Roblox, and Microsoft will need to find ways for players to move between those worlds instead of keeping them siloed — and for the most part, that isn’t on the horizon. Sweeney says Epic hasn’t had “those sorts of discussions” with anyone but Disney yet. “But we will, over time,” he says. He described an ideal where companies, working as peers, would use revenue sharing as a way to create incentives for item shops that people want to buy digital goods from and “sources of engagement” (like Fortnite experiences) that people want to spend time in. “The whole thesis here is that players are gravitating towards games which they can play together with all their friends, and players are spending more on digital items in games that they trust they’re going to play for a long time,” Sweeney says. “If you’re just dabbling in a game, why would you spend money to buy an item that you’re never going to use again? If we have an interoperable economy, then that will increase player trust that today’s spending on buying digital goods results in things that they’re going to own for a long period of time, and it will work in all the places they go.” “People are not dogmatic about where they play” “There’s no reason why we couldn’t have a federated way to flow between Roblox, Minecraft, and Fortnite,” Epic EVP Saxs Persson says. “From our perspective, that would be amazing, because it keeps people together and lets the best ecosystem win.” Epic sees in its surveys that “people are not dogmatic about where they play,” Persson says. Of course, there’s plenty of opportunity for Epic, which already makes a widely played game and a widely used game engine and is building Fortnite into a game-making tool. (And I haven’t even mentioned how Unreal Engine is increasingly used in filmmaking and other industries.) The end state sounds great for Epic, but Epic also has to make the math make sense for everyone else. And it has to do that without much of a presence on mobile. The company has spent years in legal battles with Apple and Google over their mobile app store practices, and it just sued Samsung, too. The Epic Games Store recently launched on Android globally and on iOS in the EU, but thanks to restrictions on third-party app stores, the company’s game store boss, Steve Allison, tells The Verge that reaching its end-of-year install goal is “likely impossible.” Any major change could take quite a while, according to Sweeney. “It will be a long battle, and it will likely result in a long series of battles, each of which moves a set of freedoms forward, rather than having a single worldwide moment of victory,” Sweeney says. There’s one other battle Epic is fighting: Fortnite is still hugely popular, but there is waning interest — or hype, at least — in the metaverse. Sweeney and Persson, however, don’t exactly agree about the term seemingly falling out of popularity. “It’s like there’s metaverse weather,” Sweeney says. “Some days it’s good, some days it’s bad. Depends on who’s doing the talking about it.”  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly. The Verge is a vox media network © 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

            "content": "By  Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, a smart home reporter who’s been testing connected gadgets since 2013. Previously a contributor to Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, and US News. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Home security company SimpliSafe has launched its new live monitoring feature — Active Guard Outdoor Protection. Announced earlier this year, the service is powered by a new outdoor camera that uses on-device and cloud-based AI to alert call center agents about potential threats on your property. The agent then gets access to a live view through the camera and can talk to any potential intruder and either deter the threat or call emergency services. Active Guard has been running in a public beta since April of this year and is now available to all SimpliSafe users. It costs $49.99 a month for overnight live guard monitoring (8PM to 6AM) or $79.99 for 24/7 live guard monitoring. Both prices include SimpliSafe’s 24/7 professional alarm monitoring of security sensors and its live indoor monitoring service, which was launched last year and requires a compatible camera.  Essentially, this new feature lets you pay someone to watch your security cameras for you. Instead of you having to react to a “person alert” from a security camera at 2 a.m., SimpliSafe’s agents can stay up all night for you.  Ring offers a similar service for its cameras, but its Live Guard feature costs $100 a month, which is on top of its standard home alarm monitoring. Starting at $50 a month, Simplisafe’s offering is impressively affordable for this type of service. SimpliSafe’s SVP of product, Hooman Shahidi, explained to The Verge how the service works. When the system is armed and the camera detects a person using on-device AI the footage is sent to the cloud for confirmation and to match against any trusted faces you’ve uploaded to your SimpliSafe app. Then, it's sent to a live agent who can view the data and access the live camera feed to confirm if it’s a friend or potential foe and assess the situation in real-time. Shahidi said if it’s a stranger, the agent will engage with the person “in a friendly manner,” escalating if necessary.  So, if it’s a delivery driver, the agent will watch until they leave and notify you that a package was delivered and when. But if it’s someone trying to break in or do damage, they’ll call the police directly and inform you in real time through app notifications. Active Guard requires SimpliSafe’s new Outdoor Camera 2, which is also launching this week. The camera costs $199.99 and has upgraded on-device processing from the original outdoor camera, plus improved night vision and better audio.  A battery-powered camera, it comes with a power cable and must be continuously powered to work with Active Guard. Shahidi says customers with the current outdoor camera can get a discount on upgrading to the new one by calling customer service.  “We are adding generative AI to help understand situational context,” Christian Cerda The company is particularly excited about the potential of this technology to reduce false alarms and cut down on crime in general. “Ninety percent of alarms are false,” said Christian Cerda, CEO at SimpliSafe, in an interview with The Verge. “And often, you wait over 10 minutes for a response. We are trying to help inform first responders so they can prioritize their resources.”  Additionally, Cerda sees this technology as moving home security from passive to active, preventing crime instead of trying to stop it once it’s begun. The company has begun deploying using generative AI to identify potential scenarios faster. “We are adding generative AI to help understand situational context, first to provide that info to the agent, then long term to filter out benign situations,” he says. “The prompt engineering uses our known experience of what is usually suspicious behavior. We can apply that to ask the AI to more narrowly look for that.  “For example, lawn services behave in a certain way; have specific movement and equipment; someone passing by usually moves with a consistent speed, whereas we know that intruders scan the property,” he says. “This is where we are finding incredible depth and value in generative AI.” However, he says they are being “extremely cautious,” that it is still early days, and that the agent always makes the final determination. Active Outdoor Guard Protection is now available to all US-based SimpliSafe customers for $49.99. The service and the new camera can be ordered at SimpliSafe.com.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Waymo has its sights set on its next robotaxi: the Hyundai Ioniq 5.  The Alphabet company announced that it was entering a “multi-year, strategic” partnership with the Hyundai Motor Group that will result in the Ioniq 5 eventually joining its robotaxi fleet.  But first, the Ioniq 5 will need to undergo on-road testing with Waymo’s self-driving technology, which the company says will begin in late 2025. Waymo wouldn’t specify when the Ioniq 5 will be used for passenger trips, except to say it would be “years” later. Vehicles intended for Waymo’s fleet will be manufactured at Hyundai’s $7.6 billion Metaplant factory in Georgia, which is nearing the end of its construction. The companies have agreed to produce a number of Waymo-equipped electric Hyundais there “in significant volume over multiple years,” Waymo said in its press release.   Waymo wouldn’t specify when the Ioniq 5 will be used for passenger trips With robotaxis, one of the most important metrics is uptime, or the amount of time it’s on the road ferrying passengers. Time spent plugged into a charger is time not making money. The Ioniq 5 is an electric crossover SUV with a little over 300 miles of range and an 800-volt architecture that enhances its charging speed. When plugged into a 350kW fast charger, Hyundai says the Ioniq 5 can charge from 10–80 percent in just 18 minutes, depending on the conditions. Waymo certainly saw those charging speeds as a benefit to its still unprofitable business.  The Ioniq 5 has received favorable reviews since it was released in late 2021, in addition to raking in numerous awards. Today, it’s one of the bestselling EVs on the market, with 30,000 sold in the US this year alone. Its popularity has helped Hyundai, along with its sister company Kia, overtake Ford and GM as the No. 2 seller of EVs in the US behind Tesla.  Currently, Waymo operates a fleet of hundreds of Jaguar I-Pace vehicles, which has been its primary robotaxi vehicle since the company’s first one, the Chrysler Pacifica minivan, was retired in 2013. The company has plans to add a new vehicle made by Geely’s Zeekr — though the Biden administration’s recent move to quadruple tariffs for electric vehicles imported from China could complicate that.  Recent reporting from South Korea previewed today’s partnership news, with sources telling Electronic Times that the two companies met numerous times at Waymo’s headquarters in California to discuss “contract manufacturing of robotaxis.” Sources also told the publication that Waymo was looking for a “replacement” for its Zeekr vehicles because of costly new tariffs.  But Waymo pushed back against this report and reiterated its intention to eventually deploy Zeekr. “The IONIQ 5 will not directly replace any of our vehicle platforms, but it will help us prepare for additional scale and growth opportunities,” Waymo spokesperson Christopher Bonelli said in an email. Waymo is “hard at work” validating the sixth version of its self-driving technology in the Zeekr vehicle, he added.  Tellingly, Waymo isn’t saying how many Ioniq 5s it plans to buy from Hyundai, in contrast to its approach to previous vehicle announcements. Some of this could be attributable to the fact that Waymo has grown more cautious about overly optimistic predictions after critics panned the AV industry for setting unrealistic deadlines.  This won’t be the Ioniq 5’s first self-driving rodeo. The vehicle also serves as a platform for Motional, which is Hyundai’s robotaxi subsidiary, as well as Avride, which used to be Yandex’s self-driving group.  But Waymo’s business is significantly, well, busier than those firms. The company recently celebrated a significant milestone: 100,000 paid trips a week.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Sean Hollister, a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget. DJI, the world’s largest drone company, is suing to avoid being seen as a tool of the Chinese government. On Friday, it sued the US Department of Defense to delete its name from a list of “Chinese Military Companies,” claiming it has no such relationship to Chinese authorities and has suffered unfairly as a result of that designation. Since DJI was added to that list in 2022, the company claims, it has “lost business deals, been stigmatized as a national security threat, and been banned from contracting with multiple federal government agencies,” and that its employees “now suffer frequent and pervasive stigmatization” and are “repeatedly harassed and insulted in public places.” It also alleges that the DoD would not offer the company any explanation for its designation as a “Chinese Military Company” until DJI threatened a lawsuit this September, and claims that when the DoD finally offered up its reasoning, it was filled with errors.  “The Department of Defense does not provide information or statements regarding any pending litigation matters,\" DoD spokesperson Maj. Selena Rodts tells The Verge.  You can read DJI’s full argument that it’s not owned or controlled by the Chinese military in the complaint below: Regardless of whether the DoD has enough evidence to label DJI this way, it’s far from the only US government entity that’s been inclined to restrict and scrutinize the company over possible ties to the Chinese government. The US Army asked units to stop using DJI drones as early as 2017.  In 2019, the US Interior Department grounded its fleet of DJI drones over spying risks. In 2020, the US Department of Commerce added DJI to its Entity List, banning US companies from exporting technology to DJI after it “enabled wide-scale human rights abuses within China through abusive genetic collection and analysis or high-technology surveillance.” In 2021, the US Treasury added DJI to its list of Non-SDN Chinese Military Industrial Complex Companies, writing that it had provided drones to the Chinese government so it could conduct surveillance of Uyghurs, and suggesting that DJI was complicit in serious human rights abuse as a result.  Some US government entities were restricted from buying new DJI drones following these various actions. And this past week, DJI reported that some of its drones have been blocked by US customs using the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act as justification. In its defense, DJI has repeatedly claimed it isn’t owned or controlled by the Chinese government, that it’s had “nothing to do with treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang,” that it’s simply selling drones that may be used for various purposes that are out of its control afterwards, that many of those purposes have helped entities (including first responders) in the United States, and that independent audits by consulting firms and US government agencies (including the DoD) have found no security threats. While DJI does admit in the complaint that two Chinese state-owned investment funds did make minority investments in the company, it claims the Shanghai Free Trade Zone Equity Fund has “less than 1% of DJI’s shares and less than 0.1% of DJI’s voting rights,” and that the Chengtong Fund ended its investment in June 2023.  (DJI says just four people control 99 percent of DJI and own 87 percent of its shares — DJI founder and early employees Frank Wang, Henry Lu, Swift Xie, and Li Zexiang.) Congress is currently considering a complete import ban of new DJI drones and other equipment in the United States by suggesting they pose a national security risk — though that ban is currently on ice. While the House of Representatives did approve it after it was tacked onto the must-pass National Defense Authorization Act, the Senate’s version of the bill doesn’t currently contain the ban (though it might still add it back). But until the US customs hold-up, which DJI is suggesting is just a misunderstanding, the US government hadn’t taken any actions that would keep stores from importing drones, consumers from buying them, or individual pilots from flying them in the United States. Even should Congress ban new DJI drones from being sold, the proposed text of those bills suggests existing owners could keep flying the ones they own.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

It’s a big milestone that marks just how important AI is to the company. AI is helping Google make money as well. Alphabet reported $88.3 billion in revenue for the quarter, with Google Services (which includes Search) revenue of $76.5 billion, up 13 percent year-over-year, and Google Cloud (which includes its AI infrastructure products for other companies) revenue of $11.4 billion, up 35 percent year-over-year. Operating incomes were also strong. Google Services hit $30.9 billion, up from $23.9 billion last year, and Google Cloud hit $1.95 billion, significantly up from last year’s $270 million. The results indicate that, while many people feel Google isn’t as reliable as it once was, the company continues to operate a very strong business. AI is a huge focus across Google, with the release of features like custom AI chatbots powered by Gemini (called “Gems”), automatic AI note-taking in Google Meet, and a bunch of generative AI tools to help YouTube creators. Google’s well-reviewed Pixel 9 lineup of smartphones were also packed with AI tools. “In Search, our new AI features are expanding what people can search for and how they search for it,” CEO Sundar Pichai says in a statement. “In Cloud, our AI solutions are helping drive deeper product adoption with existing customers, attract new customers and win larger deals. And YouTube’s total ads and subscription revenues surpassed $50 billion over the past four quarters for the first time.” Google is facing a potentially tough road ahead, however, following the August ruling that the company is a monopolist in the search and advertising markets. That case, brought by the US Department of Justice, is now in its remedies phase, and while there’s still a ways to go for the dust to settle, a Google breakup is on the table.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

The company confirmed the tests to The Verge as well, with spokesperson Jessica Gibby saying that it has been testing a “different version” of the subscription with “some users in Australia, Germany and Thailand for several months (with the most recent one beginning in Australia at the start of this year).” Gibby adds that “we don’t have anything else to share in terms of a broader rollout at this time.” According to a screenshot shared by singer-songwriter Jonah Manzano on Threads, the Premium Lite subscription in Australia costs $8.99 AUD per month on the web, or slightly less than half of the $16.99 AUD cost for the full version of Premium. On iOS, the costs are $11.99 AUD for Premium Lite and $22.99 AUD for Premium, according to another screenshot from Manzano. While the previous version of Premium Lite had no ads on YouTube and YouTube kids, this new version has limited ads instead. In a footnote, YouTube writes that ads may appear on “music content and Shorts” and users might see “non-interruptive ads when you search and browse.” The rubric in the screenshot also shows that this version of Premium Lite doesn’t offer ad-free access to YouTube Music, the ability to download and play videos offline, or the ability to listen to videos in the background, which also weren’t available with the old Premium Lite.

Apple is adding a new child safety feature that lets kids send a report to Apple when they are sent photos or videos with nudity, according to The Guardian. After reviewing anything received, the company can report messages to law enforcement. The new feature expands on Apple’s Communication Safety feature, which uses on-device scanning to detect nudity in photos or videos received via Messages, AirDrop, or Contact Poster and blur them out. In addition to blurring the photo or video, Apple also shows a pop-up with options to message an adult, get resources for help, or block the contact. As part of this new feature, which is in testing now in Australia with iOS 18.2, users will also be able to send a report to Apple about any images or videos with nudity. “The device will prepare a report containing the images or videos, as well as messages sent immediately before and after the image or video,” The Guardian says. “It will include the contact information from both accounts, and users can fill out a form describing what happened.” From there, Apple will look at the report, and it can choose to take actions such as stopping a user from sending iMessages or reporting to law enforcement. Earlier this week, Google announced an expansion of on-device scanning of text messages in its Android app that will include an optional Sensitive Content Warning that blurs images with nudity as well as offering “help-finding resources and options.” Once it rolls out, the feature will be enabled by default for users under 18. The Guardian says that Apple plans to make the new feature available globally but didn’t specify when that might happen. Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. In 2021, Apple announced a set of child safety features that included scanning a user’s iCloud Photos library for child sexual abuse material and would alert parents when their kids sent or received sexually explicit photos. After privacy advocates spoke out against the plan, Apple delayed the launch of those features to go back to the drawing board, and it dropped its plans to scan for child sexual abuse imagery in December 2022.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Airbnb is making it easier for hosts to find someone to manage their Airbnb. The new “Co-Host Network,” which is available starting today, lets you compare co-hosts and work with the co-hosts that you hire right inside the app. Third-party Airbnb management companies are quite common already, but a co-host network directly in the Airbnb app could be a more convenient option for some users. Co-hosts can help with things like managing your listing and messaging guests that have booked at your Airbnb. Hosts are also able to choose from a range of payout options for their co-hosts, such as a cleaning fee, a percentage per booking, or a fixed amount.  Airbnb has been piloting a co-hosting hiring service for “several years,” Skift reports, but this new release marks its availability in the app and its expansion to countries like the US, Canada, and the UK. “With more than 10,000 co-hosts across 10 countries, we’re making it easy to find the best co-host for you,” Airbnb says in a blog post. “Our personalized ranking algorithm recommends a list of co-hosts based on more than 80 factors, including your location, hosting experience, and type of home. You’ll see their profile and reviews, and you can connect with them right in the app.” Airbnb says its new 2024 Winter Release also includes “over 50 upgrades for guests,” including suggested destinations when you tap the search bar, personalized listing highlights, and a redesigned checkout page.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Kylie Robison,  a senior AI reporter working with The Verge's policy and tech teams. She previously worked at Fortune Magazine and Business Insider.  Humans have automated tasks for centuries. Now, AI companies see a path to profit in harnessing our love of efficiency, and they’ve got a name for their solution: agents.  AI agents are autonomous programs that perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with environments with little human input, and they’re the focus of every major company working on AI today. Microsoft has “Copilots” designed to help businesses automate things like customer service and administrative tasks. Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian recently outlined a pitch for six different AI productivity agents, and Google DeepMind just poached OpenAI’s co-lead on its AI video product, Sora, to work on developing a simulation for training AI agents. Anthropic released a feature for its AI chatbot, Claude, that will let anyone create their own “AI assistant.” OpenAI includes agents as level 2 in its 5-level approach to reach AGI, or human-level artificial intelligence. Obviously, computing is full of autonomous systems. Many people have visited a website with a pop-up customer service bot, used an automated voice assistant feature like Alexa Skills, or written a humble IFTTT script. But AI companies argue “agents” — you’d better not call them bots — are different. Instead of following a simple, rote set of instructions, they believe agents will be able to interact with environments, learn from feedback, and make decisions without constant human input. They could dynamically manage tasks like making purchases, booking travel, or scheduling meetings, adapting to unforeseen circumstances and interacting with systems that could include humans and other AI tools. Artificial intelligence companies hope that agents will provide a way to monetize powerful, expensive AI models. Venture capital is pouring into AI agent startups that promise to revolutionize how we interact with technology. Businesses envision a leap in efficiency, with agents handling everything from customer service to data analysis. For individuals, AI companies are pitching a new era of productivity where routine tasks are automated, freeing up time for creative and strategic work. The endgame for true believers is to create AI that is a true partner, not just a tool. “What you really want,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told MIT Technology Review earlier this year, “is just this thing that is off helping you.” Altman described the killer app for AI as a “super-competent colleague that knows absolutely everything about my whole life, every email, every conversation I’ve ever had, but doesn’t feel like an extension.” It can tackle simple tasks instantly, Altman added, and for more complex ones, it will attempt them but return with questions if needed. Tech companies have been trying to automate the personal assistant since at least the 1970s, and now, they promise they’re finally getting close. At an OpenAI press event ahead of the company’s annual Dev Day, head of developer experience Romain Huet demonstrated the company’s new Realtime API with an assistant agent. Huet gave the agent a budget and some constraints for buying 400 chocolate-covered strawberries and asked it to place an order via a phone call to a fictitious shop. The service is similar to a Google reservation-making bot called Duplex from 2018. But that bot could only handle the simplest scenarios — it turned out a quarter of its calls were actually made by humans. Do you work at OpenAI? I’d love to chat. You can reach me securely on Signal @kylie.01 or via email at kylie@theverge.com. While that order was placed in English, Huet told me he gave a more complex demo in Tokyo: he prompted an agent to book a hotel room for him in Japanese where it would handle the conversation in Japanese and then call him back in English to confirm it’s done. “Of course, I wouldn’t understand the Japanese part — it just handles it,” Huet said. But Huet’s demo immediately sparked concerns in the room full of journalists. Couldn’t the AI assistant be used for spam calls? Why didn’t it identify itself as an AI system? (Huet updated the demo for the official Dev Day, an attendee says, making the agent identify itself as “Romain’s AI Assistant.”) The unease was palpable, and it wasn’t surprising — even without agents, AI tools are already being used for deception. There was another, arguably more immediate problem: the demo didn’t work. The agent lacked enough information and incorrectly recorded dessert flavors, causing it to auto-populate flavors like vanilla and strawberry in a column, rather than saying it didn’t have that information. Agents frequently run into issues with multi-step workflows or unexpected scenarios. And they burn more energy than a conventional bot or voice assistant. Their need for significant computational power, especially when reasoning or interacting with multiple systems, makes them costly to run at scale. AI agents offer a leap in potential, but for everyday tasks, they aren’t yet significantly better than bots, assistants, or scripts. OpenAI and other labs aim to enhance their reasoning through reinforcement learning, all while hoping Moore’s Law continues to deliver cheaper, more powerful computing. So, if AI agents aren’t yet very useful, why is the idea so popular? In short: market pressures. These companies are sitting on powerful but expensive technology and are desperate to find practical use cases that they can also charge users for. The gap between promise and reality also creates a compelling hype cycle that fuels funding, and it just so happens that OpenAI raised $6.6 billion right as it started hyping agents. AI agent startups have secured $8.2 billion in investor funding over the last 12 months Big tech companies have been rushing to integrate all kinds of “AI” into their products, but they hope AI assistants, in particular, could be the key to unlocking revenue. Huet’s AI calling demo outpaces what models can currently do at scale, but he told me he expects features like it to appear more commonly as soon as next year, as OpenAI refines its “reasoning” o1 model. For now, the concept seems to be mostly siloed in enterprise software stacks, not products for consumers. Salesforce, which provides customer relationship management (CRM) software, spun up an “agent” feature to great fanfare a few weeks ahead of its annual Dreamforce conference. The feature lets customers use natural language to essentially build a customer service chatbot in a few minutes through Slack, instead of spending a lot of time coding one. The chatbots have access to a company’s CRM data and can process natural language easier than a bot not based on large language models, potentially making them better at limited tasks like asking questions about orders and returns. AI agent startups (still an admittedly nebulous term) are already becoming quite a buzzy investment. They’ve secured $8.2 billion in investor funding over the last 12 months, spread over 156 deals, an increase of 81.4 percent year over year, according to PitchBook data. One of the better-known projects is Sierra, a customer service agent similar to Salesforce’s latest project and launched by former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor. There’s also Harvey, which offers AI agents for lawyers, and TaxGPT, an AI agent to handle your taxes. Despite all the enthusiasm for agents, these high-stakes uses raise a clear question: can they actually be trusted with something as serious as law or taxes? AI hallucinations, which have frequently tripped up users of ChatGPT, currently have no remedy in sight. More fundamentally, as IBM presciently stated in 1979, “a computer can never be held accountable” — and as a corollary, “a computer must never make a management decision.” Rather than autonomous decision-makers, AI assistants are best viewed as what they truly are: powerful but imperfect tools for low-stakes tasks. Is that worth the big bucks AI companies hope people will pay? For now, market pressures prevail, and AI companies are racing to monetize. “I think 2025 is going to be the year that agentic systems finally hit the mainstream,” OpenAI’s new chief product officer, Kevin Weil, said at the press event. “And if we do it right, it takes us to a world where we actually get to spend more time on the human things that matter, and a little less time staring at our phones.”  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. I used to hate jigsaw puzzles. I thought they were frustrating, messy, and took way too long to solve. But my wife showed me how those parts of jigsaw puzzles can actually be fun: there’s something satisfying and meditative about working through those frustrations, sorting through the mess, and putting a picture together, one piece at a time, over the course of a few hours. (Or days.) The makers of Wilmot Works It Out, a new puzzle game, understand this, and everything about the game is designed to make solving puzzles fun instead of annoying. In the game, you play as Wilmot, an adorable white square with a face who has a puzzle-by-mail subscription. (He’s the same smiley square from Wilmot’s Warehouse, a 2019 puzzle game also made by developers Hollow Ponds and Richard Hogg and published by Finji.) Every time you open a new package delivered by Sam, your mail carrier friend, the pieces appear in a jumble on the floor so you can match them together into a picture to put on the wall. When you’ve put up a completed puzzle, Sam typically comes knocking with a brief conversation and a new box of pieces to sift through. After you finish a bunch of puzzles, you’ll complete a “season” and can move on to the next, which amps up the difficulty. Wilmot Works It Out has a few clever ways to iron out the process of putting pieces together. Unlike every jigsaw puzzle I’ve done in real life, the puzzle pieces in Wilmot are all square. That sounds annoying, but because you don’t have to rotate the pieces to match them, it’s much easier to compare pieces side to side to see if they might fit together. When you slide a piece next to its correct counterpart, the piece you’re holding flashes once, and you’ll hear a soft but satisfying chime. I loved chasing those chimes.  Those design choices make it much easier to quickly assemble puzzles. But the game’s best trick is that puzzle packages typically contain a few pieces that connect to a puzzle you can’t finish yet. Because of that, you’re constantly trying to figure out which pieces fit a puzzle you can solve now and which pieces are supposed to be set aside for later. Some puzzles are quite tricky In the early seasons, I didn’t find this to be too difficult. That changed in the later seasons, though, as the developers have some devilish tricks to make you really work to figure out which pieces belong with which puzzles. One season, for example, featured pieces that seemed to assemble into a peacock with big colorful circles on its feathers. Then, I started matching pieces with more colorful circles, but they turned out to be owl eyes. I tried to find a way for the owls and peacock to connect for longer than I care to admit — until I eventually realized that they were two separate pictures. Two of my biggest problems with jigsaw puzzles have been how long they take and how messy they are. They can take what should be a fun activity and turn it into a chore. But Wilmot Works It Out fixes both, highlighting what I love about jigsaw puzzles in a delightful video game. Wilmot Works It Out is out now on PC and Mac.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly. The Verge is a vox media network © 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Adobe is attempting to lure illustrators to join its creative software platform by making its dedicated drawing and painting app entirely free for everyone. Fresco is essentially Adobe’s answer to apps like Procreate and Clip Studio Paint, which all provide a variety of tools for both digital art and simulating real-world materials like sketching pencils and watercolor paints. Adobe Fresco is designed for touch and stylus-supported devices, and is available on iPad, iPhone, and Windows PCs. The app already had a free-to-use tier, but premium features like access to the full Adobe Fonts library, a much wider brush selection, and the ability to import custom brushes previously required a $9.99 annual subscription. That’s pretty affordable for an Adobe subscription, but still couldn’t compete with Procreate’s $12.99 one-time purchase model. Starting today, all of Fresco’s premium features are no longer locked behind a paywall. The app first launched in 2019 and isn’t particularly well-known compared to more established Adobe apps like Photoshop and Illustrator that feature more complex, professional design tools. Fresco still has some interesting features of its own, like reflective and rotation symmetry (which mirror artwork as you draw) and the ability to quickly animate drawings with motion presets like “bounce” and “breathe.” Competing apps like Procreate, Clip Studio Paint, and Krita are already popular in the digital art community: they’re affordable, easy to use, and supported on iPads, which can be much cheaper compared to buying both a computer and professional drawing tablets. Chances are that most of the fan art, web comics, and general illustrations from hobbyists and indie designers you see online were made using these tools instead of Adobe’s apps, let alone Fresco.  Procreate especially has a notably devoted user base because of both its pricing and vocal pledge against introducing any generative AI tools, which appeals to artists who are concerned about how the technology is trained and may impact job opportunities.  Fresco hasn’t integrated any of Adobe’s generative AI features and has some advantages over Procreate, such as a desktop app and cloud storage support (while Procreate files are saved on-device). Making it completely free could be enough to tempt new users to the platform, despite the wider image problem Adobe has with parts of the creative community.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  David Nield Having to hand your iPhone over to someone can be a fairly common occurrence. Maybe your little nephew wants to play a game or your friend wants to check out the photos from your last vacation. Whatever the reason, no matter how much you trust that person, there are probably parts of your phone that you’d rather they didn’t see (even accidentally). That’s where the new Face ID lock in iOS 18 comes in: you can now get your iPhone to ask for biometric authentication whenever a particular app is launched. (While we refer to Face ID throughout this article, if you’re on an older phone with Touch ID, you can use that instead.) This means your friend or family member can’t dive straight into your private chat conversations or your current dating app of choice.  If you’re thinking, “I’m sure I could lock apps with Face ID before iOS 18,” you’re right — up to a point. The technology was available, but it was up to app developers to implement it. And for the most part, outside of banking and financial apps, we haven’t seen many developers add Face ID logins. (With some exceptions, such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.) What’s new after the rollout of iOS 18 is that any app can be locked using Face ID, whether or not the developer has built in support for the feature. Games, chat apps, social media — anything can now be protected with a Face ID login. This comes with another feature: the option to hide apps. This is available for any third-party app but not apps installed with iOS 18. Hidden apps aren’t shown on the homescreens and have their own Hidden folder in the App Library. You also won’t get any notifications from hidden apps, so keep that in mind. You can lock and unlock apps from the homescreen or from the App Library: 1/5 1/5 Whenever any app locked in this way is launched, Face ID approval will be required to actually open in, which means no one but you will be able to get in. To remove the Face ID restriction, just repeat the long press on the app to get to its menu. If you chose to hide the app, you’ll need to open the Hidden folder in the App Library to get to the options again. In addition, you’ll have to replace the icon on your homescreen — it won’t automatically reappear on the same page it was on before. There is one more trick you can use if you’re lending someone your phone: set up the iOS accessibility feature Guided Access so the other person is only able to use one app or game on the device. The feature can be enabled from iOS Settings: Head to the app your friend or family member wants to use and launch Guided Access by triple-pressing on the power button and choosing Guided Access and then Start. The navigation bar disappears, and there’s no way to switch to the homescreens or any other app. The only way out of Guided Access is to triple-press on the power button again — at which point Face ID authentication (or your custom passcode) is required. Through Face ID lock or Guided Access — or a combination of both — you should be able to lend out your iPhone without worrying what other people are up to on it.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Victoria Song, a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 12 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine. The Bose Sleepbuds are back. Kind of. After Bose decided to discontinue the product in 2023, three ex-Bose engineers decided to acquire the technology and relaunch the device under the name Ozlo. The buds have been around for a while via a crowdfunding campaign, but starting today, they’re officially available for $299.  Fans of the Bose Sleepbuds will be happy to know the Ozlo buds keep what was great about the originals while making one key improvement: you can now play your own audio, not just a small library of white noise sounds. And if you want the best of both worlds, the buds can switch over from your content to white noise once they’ve detected you’ve fallen asleep. It’s been hit or miss in the few nights I’ve tried it. Some nights, I’ve fallen asleep listening to an audiobook and briefly woken up to the sound of a babbling brook. Success!  Other nights, I’ve woken up the next day several chapters ahead in my book with no memory of what’s happened.  The design of the Sleepbuds hasn’t changed much. To the naked eye, everything looks nearly identical, save for the big Ozlo logo on the case instead of Bose. If you liked the Bose Sleepbuds, you’ll be happy to know these wear exactly the same. (If you didn’t like them, well, you probably won’t like these, either.) While fit will depend on the person, the buds are still super lightweight, and as a side sleeper, I didn’t feel any discomfort. They also never fell out of my ear, unlike Anker’s Soundcore Sleep earbuds. On the flip side, Bluetooth pairing remains a bit finicky. You still have to keep the buds in the case to fully pair them before you plop them in your ears. And even though they do let you listen to your own content now, these are still strictly sleep buds, so you can’t take phone calls on them and they don’t have active noise cancellation. Battery life is also unchanged, at 10 hours, and you can still set private alarms.  Both the case and buds now have biometric sensors for sleep tracking, though that feature isn’t active yet, so I didn’t get to try it. In an email, Ozlo CEO Rockwell Shah tells The Verge that there are accelerometers in the buds, while the case has light, noise, and temperature sensors. Shah says sleep tracking should arrive in early 2025. When it does, the Ozlo buds will be able to detect movement, respiration rate, sleep staging, snoring, noise disturbances, and light / temperature fluctuations in a room, so you can see how certain factors — like a snoring partner — can impact your sleep.  My biggest complaint, however, about the old Bose Sleepbuds was that they were expensive for a pair of sleep-only buds. The Ozlo Sleepbuds are $50 more at $299 — though technically they do pack in more tech. That said, Ozlo is offering an experimental beta program called Ozlo Flex where you can “subscribe” to the buds for $20 a month and cancel at any time, with free returns. (Folks who pay the full $299 upfront do not have to pay a subscription.)  I still need more time with the Ozlo Sleepbuds before I can deliver a final verdict, especially as sleep tracking isn’t available yet. Even so, I’ve clocked a few great nights of sleep and can’t help but root for them. After all, products don’t often come back from the grave, let alone better than before. There are still a few kinks that need working out, but all in all, fans of the Bose Sleepbud should rejoice.

            "content": "By  Jay Peters, a news editor who writes about technology, video games, and virtual worlds. He’s submitted several accepted emoji proposals to the Unicode Consortium. Roblox is making some potentially major changes that will limit what pre-teens can access and give parents more control over what their kids do on the platform, according to an email sent by the company and shared with The Verge. The changes follow recent reports highlighting how Roblox has failed to protect children. In July, for example, Bloomberg published a big report about predators on the platform. Turkey blocked access to Roblox in August, saying it was a necessary measure to protect its children. (Roblox said this week that it would open an office in the country if access was restored.) Earlier this month, a popular financial newsletter accused Roblox of enabling child abuse and the investment firm Hindenburg Research alleged that its “in-game research revealed an X-rated pedophile hellscape.” As part of the changes, which Bloomberg initially reported on, users younger than 13 will have to get parent permission to access “certain chat features” while users that are younger than 9 will need their parents’ permission to play experiences that have a “moderate” content label. (That label means the experience may contain things like moderate violence or crude humor.) The company had already announced that it will be switching from “experience guidelines,” which rates experiences for specific ages, over to the new content label system this fall. Roblox is also adding a new type of account that will let parents manage their kids on the platform. With the new parent accounts, parents can link their account to their child’s so they can update parental controls and access insights about their child’s Roblox usage, such as daily screen time and their Roblox friends. However, alongside these changes, Roblox won’t let parents set a PIN to make changes to an account. The company is also deprecating its standalone Account Restrictions feature, which lets parents block a kid’s account from sending in-game chats or limit a kid’s account to only accessing experiences designed “for all ages,” though parents will be able to adjust those restrictions within the new parent accounts instead.   “The updates that were shared via email are part of Roblox’s commitment to making the platform one of the safest online environments for our users, particularly the youngest users,” Roblox’s Juliet Chaitin-Lefcourt tells The Verge. “We’re excited to share more information next month.” Here is Roblox’s full email: New parental controls and insights are coming soon Dear parent, We’ve been working on a series of important changes that we’ll be making to your child’s account, ____________, next month. About Roblox accounts with parent privileges Next month, we’re changing the way parents manage their child’s experience on Roblox by introducing Roblox accounts with parent privileges. After linking your account to your child’s, parents can view and update parental controls for their child all from their own device. Parents also get access to insights about their child’s Roblox usage, such as their daily screen time and on-platform friends. Given these changes, starting next month, parents will no longer be able to set a parent PIN, use Account Restrictions, or receive account-related notifications to their parental email. Instead, you will need to use an account with parent privileges. Existing verified parental emails on child accounts will continue to be used for account recovery. Any settings previously set using a parent PIN will not change, but you will need an account with parent privileges to make updates going forward.  As always, if users are interested in an added layer of security on their account, you can set up 2-factor authentication. Updated content maturity settings As we shared with the community in July, to help provide parents and users more clarity into the types of content available on Roblox, we’ll soon begin labeling experiences based on the type of content users can expect in an experience, rather than by age. Experience Guidelines will be renamed Content Labels, and you’ll be able to set limits on the type of content accessible to your child through the content maturity setting in parental controls. New default settings for users under the age of 13 As part of Roblox’s commitment to safety, we are also updating certain default settings for our youngest users. Starting next month, users under the age of 13 will need parent permission to access certain chat features. Users under the age of 9 will also need parent permission to access experiences with content maturity “Moderate,” which may contain things like moderate violence or moderate crude humor. Your child’s settings will be updated when they reach certain ages, if you and your child haven’t previously made changes to them. You and your child will be notified of these updates in advance. We will share more information on these setting updates when the changes go into effect next month. Next steps To continue receiving notifications about your child’s account related to spending or other important activity, you’ll need to set up a Roblox account with parent privileges and link to your child’s account. When these changes take effect, your child will receive a notification inviting them to add a linked parent account, and we’ll send you an email with instructions. Since day one, Roblox has been committed to building safety features and tools into the design of our products. We will always continue to explore different ways to update our parental controls to make them even more useful for parents. Roblox Correction, October 24th: Roblox’s Account Restrictions feature is going away, but parents will still be able to access and set certain limits from within the parent accounts.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Even with most of its autonomous vehicle fleet on ice, Cruise is still bleeding cash. The robotaxi company that is a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors lost $435 million in the third quarter of 2024, GM reported this morning. That’s an improvement from the $791 million lost in the third quarter of 2023.  It’s an instructive moment to check in with Cruise because the company has been on hiatus since October 27th, 2023, weeks after one of its driverless vehicles in San Francisco struck and then dragged a pedestrian over 20 feet, severely injuring her.  Cruise has made small steps toward restarting its robotaxi service since then, with test vehicles on the roads in Arizona and Texas. It recently announced plans to deploy manually driven vehicles in the Bay Area later this year, but it still hasn’t said when it will resume its paid commercial service.  Cruise is unique in the world of autonomous cars in so far as we have much more insight into the company’s finances than nearly all of its competitors. Since GM breaks Cruise out in its earnings reports, we know about its net sales and revenue ($26 million for Q3), its total cost and expenses ($442 million), and its operating income (a loss of $417 million).  Cruise is unique in the world of autonomous cars Investors are no doubt pleased that GM has succeeded in stemming some of its losses with Cruise. The robotaxi subsidiary lost a staggering $3.48 billion in 2023 and has been seen by some as an albatross for the automaker, sucking up cash and lacking a clear path to profits. But GM CEO Mary Barra has long been bullish on autonomous vehicles — perhaps more than is warranted. Other automakers have pulled their investments out of fully driverless cars, tired of continuing to pour money into a project without a clear sign of returns on the horizon. But Barra doubled down. In 2022, she took the stage at the annual Consumer Electronics Show and boldly declared that GM would sell fully autonomous vehicles to regular people by the middle of the decade.  I think it’s safe to say that GM won’t meet that deadline. But while investors have encouraged GM to cut their losses with Cruise, she has stuck by the project. This past year, Barra has directed a reorganization at Cruise, ousting its founders and replacing them with auto and tech industry veterans.  There have been other cost-cutting measures. Cruise laid off 25 percent of its workforce and canceled its Origin project, a driverless shuttle without a steering wheel or pedals, absorbing a $534 million loss in the process. And it agreed to pay millions in fines to state and federal regulators to settle investigations into its response to the pedestrian-dragging incident.  “We will continue to be disciplined with our investments in Cruise,” Barra said during an investor event earlier this month. She also said the AV division would only lose no more than $2 billion in 2025.  And in an earnings call on Tuesday, Barra said that GM would have news to share in the days to come about Cruise’s “funding model” — implying that there would be partners brought on to help defray the cost of operating a fleet of driverless cars.  Driverless cars are expensive. No one is making money yet, not even Waymo, with all the might and resources of Alphabet at its back. GM has had its share of headwinds, but it stands a decent chance as any of proving whether the technology can be safe and profitable in the future.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. For almost as long as he’s been CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk has been bullshitting us about self-driving cars.  In 2016, he said Tesla self-driving cars were “two years away.” A year later, it was “six months, definitely,” and customers would be able to actually sleep in their Tesla in “two years.” In 2018, it was still a “year away” and would be “200 percent safer” than human driving. In 2019, he said there would be “feature complete full self-driving this year.” There hasn’t been a year go by without Musk promising the imminent arrival of a fully driverless Tesla.  This week, it’s finally here. Or at least that’s what Musk says. On October 10th, Tesla will reveal its long-awaited “robotaxi,” a supposedly fully autonomous vehicle that Musk has said will catapult the company into trillion-dollar status. It will be some combination of “Uber and Airbnb,” Musk said during a recent earnings call, allowing Tesla owners to serve as landlords for their driverless cars as they roam about the cityscape, picking up and dropping off strangers. And it will be futuristic in its design, with Bloomberg reporting that it will be a two-seater with butterfly wing doors. Musk has been calling it the “Cybercab.” The event, which will be held on the film lot of Warner Bros. in Burbank, California, will be the culmination of almost a decade of blown deadlines and broken promises from Musk, a moment when the richest man in the world will finally be forced to stop hiding behind his own bluster and actually show us what he’s been working on.  It’s a vulnerable time for Tesla. The company’s sales slumped in the first half of the year, as rising competition in the US and China dimmed Tesla’s star. Musk is fighting to reclaim his enormous $56 billion pay package, all while spreading misinformation on his social media platform and stumping for former President Donald Trump. And now there’s this product event, Tesla’s first since the unveiling of the Cybertruck in 2019.  Almost a decade of blown deadlines and broken promises Based on past Tesla events, don’t expect Musk to follow through on all his promises.  It seems likely that we’ll see a cool demo of a stylish-looking prototype, allowing Musk to claim a kind of victory for first impressions, even when the rough outlines of what he promises will barely hold up to scrutiny. The exaltations from bullish investors will give him enough cover to continue to make misleading declarations about what is and isn’t autonomous. And the safety experts and competitors who try to warn about the dangers of his approach will likely be drowned out or dismissed by his most ardent fans.  But either it works or it doesn’t. Waymo and others have already shown the world what real driverless technology looks like. It’s imperfect and it’s limited, but it’s undeniable. If Musk fails to deliver or shows off some obvious vaporware, his reputation — and Tesla’s stock price — could take a real hit.  “He’s really grasping for straws,” said Mary “Missy” Cummings, a robotics expert and former senior safety official at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. “He’s so desperate to try to drive more money into this equation that he’s doing things like this [event].” I first started covering Tesla for The Verge in 2016, the same year that Musk made one of his first predictions about the imminent arrival of self-driving cars. “You’ll be able to summon your car from across the country,” he said, citing as an example a Tesla owner beckoning their vehicle to drive solo from New York to meet him in Los Angeles. The company went even further in a blog post, boasting that “all Tesla vehicles produced in our factory — including Model 3 — will have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than a human driver.” That post has since been deleted from Tesla’s site, along with the company’s first “Master Plan,” as Musk attempts to scrub Tesla’s past of all his overreaching pronouncements.  “Substantially greater than a human driver” But more importantly, these kinds of statements fooled a lot of people into thinking the shiny new electric car in their driveway would have everything they needed to be fully autonomous and that those futuristic capabilities were just around the corner. Elon Musk would flip the switch and — presto — millions of cars would suddenly transform into robots. The media bought into it, portraying Tesla as being on the cusp of a historical evolution. And soon enough, the company’s stock started reflecting this attitude, especially after Tesla defied expectations with the Model 3.  Of course, none of it was true. Nearly a decade later, no Tesla vehicle on the road today is autonomous. Sure, the company has rolled out a series of brashly branded driver-assist features — first Autopilot, then Navigate on Autopilot, then Full Self-Driving, and finally Full Self-Driving (Supervised) — but they do not enable the car to drive without constant human supervision. You can’t sleep in your Tesla. You can’t summon it across town, let alone across the country. If you crash, you will be liable for what happens and who gets hurt. And if you attempt to fight the company on any of that, you will probably lose.  You can’t sleep in your Tesla Even those Tesla owners lured into thinking their vehicles were incognito robots would soon realize the cost of the company’s obfuscations. In 2021, Tesla first started offering subscriptions to its long-awaited Full Self-Driving feature, including a $1,500 hardware upgrade for those early owners who were wrongly informed that their vehicle would have “the hardware needed” for full autonomy. (It was later lowered to $1,000 after customer outcry.) There are plenty of people using Full Self-Driving (Supervised) today who will happily tell you how great it is and how they can’t imagine life without it. (Many also have YouTube channels they want to promote.) They will also argue over the semantics of autonomy. Shouldn’t something that controls the acceleration, braking, steering, and navigation also get to be called autonomous?  In the absence of data from Tesla, it’s impossible to say how good or terrible FSD is with any certainty. Crowd-sourced projects like FSD Community Tracker are extremely limited, only featuring data on a scant 200,000 miles of driving. Tesla says over 1 billion miles have been driven using FSD. But even the tracker’s tiny snapshot of data shows 119 miles between critical disengagements. Waymo drove 17,000 miles between disengagements in 2023, according to the California DMV.  While Tesla chased a much broader vision, Waymo leapt forward by realizing something more workable: remove the driver entirely and restrict the geography in which the vehicle can operate. Google, from which Waymo spun out in 2016, has long argued that advanced driver-assistance systems like Autopilot and FSD were inherently problematic. After all, human supervisors get bored and eventually zone out. The handoff between the vehicle and the driver can be fraught. It’s better to just cut the human out of the equation altogether.  Tesla is now latching onto Waymo’s better vision in unveiling a fully autonomous vehicle, the robotaxi. This is the vehicle that can silence all of those doubters. After all, Waymo doesn’t sell cars; it sells a service. Tesla sells cars. And wouldn’t it be infinitely cooler to own your own self-driving vehicle?  Tesla likes to say that Autopilot — and later FSD — is saving lives. In fact, Musk has gone even further, declaring any criticism of its driver-assistance products amounts to murder. “You need to think carefully about this,” he said in 2016, “because if, in writing some article that’s negative, you effectively dissuade people from using an autonomous vehicle, you’re killing people.” At the same time, he said that Tesla had no plans to assume legal liability for crashes or deaths that occurred when Autopilot was in use unless it was “something endemic to our design.” Even in the annals of Musk quotes that have aged poorly, these rank up there. At the time, only one person had died while using Autopilot — a reflection, perhaps, of the small number of Tesla vehicles on the road. Now, there are over 2 million Teslas all over the globe and a substantially higher number of deaths.  “Something endemic to our design” Presently, federal regulators are investigating at least 1,000 individual Tesla crashes involving Autopilot and FSD. Of those crashes, at least 44 people died. Investigators found that Autopilot — and, in some cases, FSD — was not designed to keep the driver engaged in the task of driving. Drivers would become overly complacent and lose focus. And when it came time to react, it was too late. Tesla has pushed out numerous updates to FSD over the years, so it can be tough to pin down what exactly is wrong with Tesla’s approach. Often, users flag a problem — the vehicle fails to recognize certain signage or a specific driving maneuver — and almost just as quickly, Tesla has an update available. That seems like a good thing — Tesla is responsive to problems and moves quickly to fix them — until you remember that real people’s lives are at stake. And the pedestrians and cyclists outside the vehicle never consented to participating in this experiment to teach cars to drive themselves.  Even the most recent version of the FSD software has its faults. An independent research firm recently tested versions 12.5.1 and 12.5.3 for over 1,000 miles and found it to be “surprisingly capable, while simultaneously problematic (and occasionally dangerously inept).” When errors occur, “they are occasionally sudden, dramatic, and dangerous.” In one instance, the group’s Tesla Model 3 ran a red light in the city during nighttime even though the cameras clearly detected the lights. FSD is the foundation for the robotaxi. Everything has been leading up to this moment. But the system struggles with basic perception issues, like wet roads and sunlight glare. FSD struggles to recognize motorcyclists: a 28-year-old motorcycle owner was killed outside of Seattle earlier this year by a Model S driver who was using the driver-assist feature.  The system struggles with basic perception issues Tesla used to publish quarterly safety reports that it would claim proved that Autopilot was safer than regular human driving — but it then stopped suddenly in 2022. It started up again this year with a new report that says there is only one crash for every 6.88 million miles of Autopilot-assisted driving, versus one for every 1.45 million miles of non-Autopilot driving. That’s over four times safer than normal human driving, according to Tesla.  This is the only safety data we have for Tesla’s driver-assist technology that is supposed to be a precursor to the fully autonomous robotaxi. But according to Noah Goodall, a civil engineer who has published several peer-reviewed studies about Tesla Autopilot, the company’s safety reports fail to take into account basic facts about traffic statistics, such as that crashes are more common on city roads and undivided roads than on the highway, where Autopilot is most often used. And it led him to the conclusion that Tesla may be miscounting crashes in order to make Autopilot seem safer than it actually is. “They fell apart pretty quickly, once you dove in just a little bit,” Goodall told me. “I have trouble publishing on this sometimes. Just because the reviewers are like, ‘Everyone knows these are fake, why are you pointing this out?’”  If there’s one thing on which everyone can agree, it’s that Tesla has a lot of data. With nearly 5 million drivers on the road globally, each vehicle is sending huge amounts of information back to the mothership for processing and labeling. Other companies, with only a fraction of the real-world miles, have to use simulated driving to fill in the gaps. But the sheer volume of data that Tesla is processing is overwhelming. The company relies on a small army of data annotators who review thousands of hours of footage from Tesla owners and the company’s in-house test drivers. And according to Business Insider, those workers are pushed to move quickly through as many images and videos as they can or face disciplinary action. Accuracy is secondary to speed.  “It’s a monumental effort,” Cummings, the robotics expert, said. “People think Teslas are learning on the fly. They have no idea how wrong they are, and just how much human preparation it takes to actually learn anything from the terabytes of data that are being gathered.” Tesla’s approach to the hardware of driverless vehicles also diverges from the rest of the industry. Musk infamously relies on a camera-only approach, in contrast to the widely used practice of relying on a “fusion” of different sensors, including radar, ultrasonic, and lidar, to power autonomous driving. Musk calls lidar, in particular, a “crutch” and claims any company that relies on the laser sensor is “doomed.” Waymo’s robotaxis are adorned with large, obvious sensors, a style expressly at odds with the sleekness of Musk’s vehicles.  Of course, Tesla does use lidar on its test vehicles, but just to validate FSD. They won’t be going on any customer cars, since lidar is still too expensive. With its tens of thousands of laser points projecting a second, lidar provides a critical layer of redundancy for the vehicle as well as a way to visualize the world in three dimensions.  The idea that you can introduce a fully autonomous vehicle without the full suite of sensors that power every other AV on earth strains credulity for most experts on the technology.  “Why on earth would you want to tie one hand behind your back when you’re solving an almost impossible problem?” said Phil Koopman, an AV expert from Carnegie Mellon University. “And we know it’s going to be big bucks, so don’t skimp on the hardware.” What is an autonomous car? It sounds like a simple question, but the answer is trickier than it seems. To help clear things up, SAE International, a US organization that represents automotive engineers, created a six-step guide to automation. Intended for engineers rather than the general public, it ranged from Level 0, meaning no automation whatsoever, to Level 5, meaning the vehicle can drive itself anywhere at any time without any human intervention. And there’s plenty of room for error and misunderstanding. A problem we’ve seen is what researcher Liza Dixon calls “autonowashing,” or any effort to overhype something as autonomous when it’s not.  Most experts dismiss Level 5 as pure science fiction. Waymo and others operate Level 4 vehicles, but very few people really believe that Level 5 is attainable. Level 5 would require “an astronomical amount of technological development, maintenance, and testing,” Torc Robotics, a company developing self-driving trucks, says. Others call it a pipe dream.  Except Musk. At a conference in Shanghai, Musk said with supreme confidence that the company “will have the basic functionality for Level 5 autonomy complete this year.” That was in July 2020. He’ll likely try to pass off the Tesla robotaxi as the endpoint of this achievement, the vehicle that will help usher in this wildly implausible goal. And it’s important to see through the bluster and bullshit and measure it against what he’s promised in the past and also what other players have already achieved.  Tesla’s history is littered with fanciful ideas that never panned out — like a solar-powered Supercharger network, battery swapping, or robotic snake-style chargers. But Musk never bet his entire company, his reputation, and most importantly, his net worth, on those projects. This one is different. And soon enough, we’ll know whether the Tesla robotaxi is the exception to the rule or just another guy dancing in a robot costume.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Most of Melo’s active user base — which peaked around 300,000 “Melo kids,” as we called ourselves — was in parts of Orange County and the Inland Empire in Southern California. “We were big in Guam, too,” the site’s creator, Sara Robertson, tells me. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRobertson coded and maintained the site almost entirely on her own. She was a kid when she started coding in the late ’80s, self-taught on a Commodore 64 and a book on BASIC that were Christmas presents from her grandmother. Then, it was on to coding for BBS communities in the ’90s, which set her up to create a personal blog that would eventually become Melodramatic.com.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t“I was 18 years old when my best friend died. I had to write about it,” says Robertson. But in the late ’90s and into the mid-2000s, there really weren’t places online where someone dealing with an immense amount of grief could express themselves or find support from a community of people. “Nothing existed at the time that filled that void,” she explains. “Nothing that connected me with people who felt the same shit and made it safe for me to talk about my shit in a judgment-free zone.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMelo launched years before Myspace, Reddit, and Tumblr and around the same time as Blogger, LiveJournal, and Open Diary. Blogs did exist in the late ’90s, but most were individually created by programmers like Robertson and usually didn’t have a comment section. But Robertson wanted to connect with other people, so she added one to her blog. Almost immediately, her posts started filling up with replies.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t“People would say, ‘My friend died, too, and here’s the story of how that happened,’” says Robertson. But they weren’t just strangers offering drive-by sympathies. Over a short period of time, Robertson and the others became a close-knit community — the exact kind of online space she couldn’t find before she started blogging. One of her friends noticed the potential for it to turn into something greater, to give more people their own space to express their truest, unfiltered emotions. They convinced her to add a chatroom (a message board system called The Wall) onto her site and let people create their own accounts.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the beginning, “nobody joined to say good shit,” Robertson says. A website named Melodramatic.com sets a specific tone, so emotionally loaded topics were the norm. But as Roberston explains, “When you are your authentic self, it tends to attract other authentic people, and it builds communities.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy the time I signed up for a Melo account, Robertson had already transformed the website again, from a chatroom to a full-fledged social network with top 10 lists and an entire social reward system. The Wall was still around, but it felt more like an extra feature of the site. Most of the time, the only people still chatting in it were the same ones who found Robertson’s blog years earlier. The main page had adopted a simple purple and black color scheme with boxed-in sections, like News and Top Members, that made it easy to navigate. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReddit may have made the karma system famous, but Melodramatic.com had it before Reddit even existed. Certain actions, like being the first person to leave a message on a new user’s guestbook, awarded different amounts of points. “People would race to welcome the new users, and that alone made it a different kind of experience,” Robertson explains. When you were the first person to comment on a user’s guestbook, which was called their “g-spot,” you got points for being a “cherry popper.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere were a few reasons to stock up on karma, too. Earning “touches,” which was the same as pressing a Like button on someone’s post or comment, was one of them. “Touches weren’t free on Melo,” Robertson says. “They were based on your karma, and you only had a certain amount that you could use every day, which made them more meaningful.” A “bang” cost 10 touches.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis was all a shock to me when I first joined. You’re welcoming me? You’re happy I’m here? The cognitive dissonance was surreal at first; total strangers were being nice to me online. That sort of thing wasn’t something I’d experienced, as much as I can remember, offline. It wasn’t long before I started doing the same to other new users, and after a while, I stopped doing it for karma and did it because it was a nice thing to do.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnother big incentive was earning enough karma to “unlock your colors,” or the ability to change the background and text colors on your profile. You could even change the Melodramatic.com logo at the top of every page. You couldn’t clog your profile with unreadable, stylized text and auto-play music like you could on Myspace, but it was enough to make your space reflect your personality.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Melo went through many color changes during the years I was active on the platform, and since all it required was a little knowledge of HTML, I was also able to add a pop-up window with a custom message that greeted people any time they visited my page. Other users did the same, some with funny messages, but most I saw were heartfelt. Mine was a quote from Hellen Keller: “The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy the early 2010s, Robertson’s labor of love had grown too popular and too expensive for her to continue self-funding. All the merch, fundraisers, and Elite subscriptions that offered users additional features weren’t enough to pay the server bills. “I was gainfully employed and making good money, but you can’t carry a $2,500 a month hobby for the rest of your life,” she says.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShe resorted to putting ads on the site to try and bring in more money, but they felt inappropriate next to the kind of things people often wrote about, like cutting themselves or contemplating suicide. It didn’t take long for Roberston to remove ads entirely. “Advertising wasn’t the right solution, but for a social platform, that’s your only option,” she says.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHer server also couldn’t always handle the user base as it grew. “I had 15 years of blog post comments, billions of rows in the database,” she says. “It had accumulated for so long that it was unwieldy, and the technology wasn’t really there at the time.” The site would occasionally crash, and Robertson would spend a couple days trying to get it back up — until one day, it went down, and she never brought it back up. She told herself that she’d “do it this weekend,” but the weekend turned into a week, then turned into two weeks, and then turned into years. Robertson says she never made a conscious decision to shut Melo down. It just sort of happened.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI ask Roberston, who now has her own children, if she has come across anything like Melodramatic.com in recent years or if a place like it could ever exist again. She doesn’t think so. TikTok and Twitter (prior to Elon Musk’s ownership) are places where she’s found similar communities and energies, but recreating or finding a niche community like Melo on today’s internet is much, much harder.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t“I have to think of it from the perspective of my kids,” says Roberston. The internet is more dangerous today — a content-hungry, money-driven, predatory kind of space. Mega platforms like Facebook, with their financial incentives, are not in a place to solve it. “You can’t monetize self-expression.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tToday’s internet feels too big and too public for another Melodramatic.com to exist, and yet it feels as essential an idea as ever. Robertson points out that everyone goes through identity challenges. It’s the nature of being human. I agree. I needed a place that wasn’t a diary hiding under my mattress to trauma-dump everything my teenage self was trying to process. I needed a safe space, a judgment-free zone, and a place that offered anonymity. Melodramatic.com gave me all three.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t“It makes me happy to walk down memory lane and be reminded that there was a fun world that I was a part of,” Robertson tells me.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI tell her it makes me happy, too. I’m not sure I’d be here today without Melo.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Shielded by the anonymity of a screen name, it was the first time I felt safe talking about my mental health — and discovered there were so many other teenagers like me who felt the same way. Even all these years later, if you search “Melodramatic.com” on Reddit, you’ll still find people reminiscing about it on occasion, some retelling the story of how they met their spouse on the site or how they literally would not be alive today if it wasn’t for being able to share their pain with others in a Melo blog.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMost people have never heard of Melodramatic.com.

A website named Melodramatic.com sets a specific tone, so emotionally loaded topics were the norm. But as Roberston explains, “When you are your authentic self, it tends to attract other authentic people, and it builds communities.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy the time I signed up for a Melo account, Robertson had already transformed the website again, from a chatroom to a full-fledged social network with top 10 lists and an entire social reward system. The Wall was still around, but it felt more like an extra feature of the site. Most of the time, the only people still chatting in it were the same ones who found Robertson’s blog years earlier. The main page had adopted a simple purple and black color scheme with boxed-in sections, like News and Top Members, that made it easy to navigate. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReddit may have made the karma system famous, but Melodramatic.com had it before Reddit even existed. Certain actions, like being the first person to leave a message on a new user’s guestbook, awarded different amounts of points. “People would race to welcome the new users, and that alone made it a different kind of experience,” Robertson explains. When you were the first person to comment on a user’s guestbook, which was called their “g-spot,” you got points for being a “cherry popper.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere were a few reasons to stock up on karma, too. Earning “touches,” which was the same as pressing a Like button on someone’s post or comment, was one of them. “Touches weren’t free on Melo,” Robertson says. “They were based on your karma, and you only had a certain amount that you could use every day, which made them more meaningful.” A “bang” cost 10 touches.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis was all a shock to me when I first joined. You’re welcoming me? You’re happy I’m here? The cognitive dissonance was surreal at first; total strangers were being nice to me online. That sort of thing wasn’t something I’d experienced, as much as I can remember, offline. It wasn’t long before I started doing the same to other new users, and after a while, I stopped doing it for karma and did it because it was a nice thing to do.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnother big incentive was earning enough karma to “unlock your colors,” or the ability to change the background and text colors on your profile. You could even change the Melodramatic.com logo at the top of every page. You couldn’t clog your profile with unreadable, stylized text and auto-play music like you could on Myspace, but it was enough to make your space reflect your personality.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Melo went through many color changes during the years I was active on the platform, and since all it required was a little knowledge of HTML, I was also able to add a pop-up window with a custom message that greeted people any time they visited my page. Other users did the same, some with funny messages, but most I saw were heartfelt. Mine was a quote from Hellen Keller: “The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy the early 2010s, Robertson’s labor of love had grown too popular and too expensive for her to continue self-funding. All the merch, fundraisers, and Elite subscriptions that offered users additional features weren’t enough to pay the server bills. “I was gainfully employed and making good money, but you can’t carry a $2,500 a month hobby for the rest of your life,” she says.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShe resorted to putting ads on the site to try and bring in more money, but they felt inappropriate next to the kind of things people often wrote about, like cutting themselves or contemplating suicide. It didn’t take long for Roberston to remove ads entirely. “Advertising wasn’t the right solution, but for a social platform, that’s your only option,” she says.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHer server also couldn’t always handle the user base as it grew. “I had 15 years of blog post comments, billions of rows in the database,” she says. “It had accumulated for so long that it was unwieldy, and the technology wasn’t really there at the time.” The site would occasionally crash, and Robertson would spend a couple days trying to get it back up — until one day, it went down, and she never brought it back up. She told herself that she’d “do it this weekend,” but the weekend turned into a week, then turned into two weeks, and then turned into years. Robertson says she never made a conscious decision to shut Melo down. It just sort of happened.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI ask Roberston, who now has her own children, if she has come across anything like Melodramatic.com in recent years or if a place like it could ever exist again. She doesn’t think so. TikTok and Twitter (prior to Elon Musk’s ownership) are places where she’s found similar communities and energies, but recreating or finding a niche community like Melo on today’s internet is much, much harder.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t“I have to think of it from the perspective of my kids,” says Roberston. The internet is more dangerous today — a content-hungry, money-driven, predatory kind of space. Mega platforms like Facebook, with their financial incentives, are not in a place to solve it. “You can’t monetize self-expression.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tToday’s internet feels too big and too public for another Melodramatic.com to exist, and yet it feels as essential an idea as ever. Robertson points out that everyone goes through identity challenges. It’s the nature of being human. I agree. I needed a place that wasn’t a diary hiding under my mattress to trauma-dump everything my teenage self was trying to process. I needed a safe space, a judgment-free zone, and a place that offered anonymity. Melodramatic.com gave me all three.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t“It makes me happy to walk down memory lane and be reminded that there was a fun world that I was a part of,” Robertson tells me.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI tell her it makes me happy, too. I’m not sure I’d be here today without Melo.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t “I was 18 years old when my best friend died. I had to write about it,” says Robertson. But in the late ’90s and into the mid-2000s, there really weren’t places online where someone dealing with an immense amount of grief could express themselves or find support from a community of people. “Nothing existed at the time that filled that void,” she explains. “Nothing that connected me with people who felt the same shit and made it safe for me to talk about my shit in a judgment-free zone.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMelo launched years before Myspace, Reddit, and Tumblr and around the same time as Blogger, LiveJournal, and Open Diary. Blogs did exist in the late ’90s, but most were individually created by programmers like Robertson and usually didn’t have a comment section. But Robertson wanted to connect with other people, so she added one to her blog. Almost immediately, her posts started filling up with replies.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t“People would say, ‘My friend died, too, and here’s the story of how that happened,’” says Robertson. But they weren’t just strangers offering drive-by sympathies. Over a short period of time, Robertson and the others became a close-knit community — the exact kind of online space she couldn’t find before she started blogging. One of her friends noticed the potential for it to turn into something greater, to give more people their own space to express their truest, unfiltered emotions. They convinced her to add a chatroom (a message board system called The Wall) onto her site and let people create their own accounts.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the beginning, “nobody joined to say good shit,” Robertson says.

But as Roberston explains, “When you are your authentic self, it tends to attract other authentic people, and it builds communities.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy the time I signed up for a Melo account, Robertson had already transformed the website again, from a chatroom to a full-fledged social network with top 10 lists and an entire social reward system. The Wall was still around, but it felt more like an extra feature of the site. Most of the time, the only people still chatting in it were the same ones who found Robertson’s blog years earlier. The main page had adopted a simple purple and black color scheme with boxed-in sections, like News and Top Members, that made it easy to navigate. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReddit may have made the karma system famous, but Melodramatic.com had it before Reddit even existed. Certain actions, like being the first person to leave a message on a new user’s guestbook, awarded different amounts of points. “People would race to welcome the new users, and that alone made it a different kind of experience,” Robertson explains. When you were the first person to comment on a user’s guestbook, which was called their “g-spot,” you got points for being a “cherry popper.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere were a few reasons to stock up on karma, too. Earning “touches,” which was the same as pressing a Like button on someone’s post or comment, was one of them. “Touches weren’t free on Melo,” Robertson says. “They were based on your karma, and you only had a certain amount that you could use every day, which made them more meaningful.” A “bang” cost 10 touches.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis was all a shock to me when I first joined. You’re welcoming me? You’re happy I’m here? The cognitive dissonance was surreal at first; total strangers were being nice to me online. That sort of thing wasn’t something I’d experienced, as much as I can remember, offline. It wasn’t long before I started doing the same to other new users, and after a while, I stopped doing it for karma and did it because it was a nice thing to do.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnother big incentive was earning enough karma to “unlock your colors,” or the ability to change the background and text colors on your profile. You could even change the Melodramatic.com logo at the top of every page. You couldn’t clog your profile with unreadable, stylized text and auto-play music like you could on Myspace, but it was enough to make your space reflect your personality.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Melo went through many color changes during the years I was active on the platform, and since all it required was a little knowledge of HTML, I was also able to add a pop-up window with a custom message that greeted people any time they visited my page. Other users did the same, some with funny messages, but most I saw were heartfelt. Mine was a quote from Hellen Keller: “The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy the early 2010s, Robertson’s labor of love had grown too popular and too expensive for her to continue self-funding. All the merch, fundraisers, and Elite subscriptions that offered users additional features weren’t enough to pay the server bills. “I was gainfully employed and making good money, but you can’t carry a $2,500 a month hobby for the rest of your life,” she says.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShe resorted to putting ads on the site to try and bring in more money, but they felt inappropriate next to the kind of things people often wrote about, like cutting themselves or contemplating suicide. It didn’t take long for Roberston to remove ads entirely. “Advertising wasn’t the right solution, but for a social platform, that’s your only option,” she says.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHer server also couldn’t always handle the user base as it grew. “I had 15 years of blog post comments, billions of rows in the database,” she says. “It had accumulated for so long that it was unwieldy, and the technology wasn’t really there at the time.” The site would occasionally crash, and Robertson would spend a couple days trying to get it back up — until one day, it went down, and she never brought it back up. She told herself that she’d “do it this weekend,” but the weekend turned into a week, then turned into two weeks, and then turned into years. Robertson says she never made a conscious decision to shut Melo down. It just sort of happened.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI ask Roberston, who now has her own children, if she has come across anything like Melodramatic.com in recent years or if a place like it could ever exist again. She doesn’t think so. TikTok and Twitter (prior to Elon Musk’s ownership) are places where she’s found similar communities and energies, but recreating or finding a niche community like Melo on today’s internet is much, much harder.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t“I have to think of it from the perspective of my kids,” says Roberston. The internet is more dangerous today — a content-hungry, money-driven, predatory kind of space. Mega platforms like Facebook, with their financial incentives, are not in a place to solve it. “You can’t monetize self-expression.”\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tToday’s internet feels too big and too public for another Melodramatic.com to exist, and yet it feels as essential an idea as ever. Robertson points out that everyone goes through identity challenges. It’s the nature of being human. I agree. I needed a place that wasn’t a diary hiding under my mattress to trauma-dump everything my teenage self was trying to process. I needed a safe space, a judgment-free zone, and a place that offered anonymity. Melodramatic.com gave me all three.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t“It makes me happy to walk down memory lane and be reminded that there was a fun world that I was a part of,” Robertson tells me.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI tell her it makes me happy, too. I’m not sure I’d be here today without Melo.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t By the time I signed up for a Melo account, Robertson had already transformed the website again, from a chatroom to a full-fledged social network with top 10 lists and an entire social reward system.

            "content": "By  Lauren Feiner, a senior policy reporter at The Verge, covering the intersection of Silicon Valley and Capitol Hill. She spent 5 years covering tech policy at CNBC, writing about antitrust, privacy, and content moderation reform. When Northwestern University graduate student Sino Esthappan began researching how algorithms decide who stays in jail, he expected “a story about humans versus technology.” On one side would be human judges, who Esthappan interviewed extensively. On the other would be risk assessment algorithms, which are used in hundreds of US counties to assess the danger of granting bail to accused criminals. What he found was more complicated — and suggests these tools could obscure bigger problems with the bail system itself. Algorithmic risk assessments are intended to calculate the risk of a criminal defendant not returning to court — or, worse, harming others — if they’re released. By comparing criminal defendants’ backgrounds to a vast database of past cases, they’re supposed to help judges gauge how risky releasing someone from jail would be. Along with other algorithm-driven tools, they play an increasingly large role in a frequently overburdened criminal justice system. And in theory, they’re supposed to help reduce bias from human judges. But Esthappan’s work, published in the journal Social Problems, found that judges aren’t wholesale adopting or rejecting the advice of these algorithms. Instead, they report using them selectively, motivated by deeply human factors to accept or disregard their scores.  Pretrial risk assessment tools estimate the likelihood that accused criminals will return for court dates if they’re released from jail. The tools take in details fed to them by pretrial officers, including things like criminal history and family profiles. They compare this information with a database that holds hundreds of thousands of previous case records, looking at how defendants with similar histories behaved. Then they deliver an assessment that could take the form of a “low,” “medium,” or “high” risk label or a number on a scale. Judges are given the scores for use in pretrial hearings: short meetings, held soon after a defendant is arrested, that determine whether (and on what conditions) they’ll be released.  As with other algorithmic criminal justice tools, supporters position them as neutral, data-driven correctives to human capriciousness and bias. Opponents raise issues like the risk of racial profiling. “Because a lot of these tools rely on criminal history, the argument is that criminal history is also racially encoded based on law enforcement surveillance practices,” Esthappan says. “So there already is an argument that these tools are reproducing biases from the past, and they’re encoding them into the future.” It’s also not clear how well they work. A 2016 ProPublica investigation found that a risk score algorithm used in Broward County, Florida, was “remarkably unreliable in forecasting violent crime.” Just 20 percent of those the algorithm predicted would commit violent crimes actually did in the next two years after their arrest. The program was also more likely to label Black defendants as future criminals or higher risk compared to white defendants, ProPublica found. Both the fears and promises around algorithms in the courtroom assume judges are consistently using them Still, University of Pennsylvania criminology professor Richard Berk argues that human decision-makers can be just as flawed. “These criminal justice systems are made with human institutions and human beings, all of which are imperfect, and not surprisingly, they don’t do a very good job in identifying or forecasting people’s behaviors,” Berk says. “So the bar is really pretty low, and the question is, can algorithms raise the bar? And the answer is yes, if proper information is provided.” Both the fears and promises around algorithms in the courtroom, however, assume judges are consistently using them. Esthappan’s study shows that’s a flawed assumption at best. Esthappan interviewed 27 judges across four criminal courts in different regions of the country over one year between 2022 and 2023, asking questions like, “When do you find risk scores more or less useful?” and “How and with whom do you discuss risk scores in pretrial hearings?” He also analyzed local news coverage and case files, observed 50 hours of bond court, and interviewed others who work in the judicial system to help contextualize the findings. Judges told Esthappan that they used algorithmic tools to process lower-stakes cases quickly, leaning on automated scores even when they weren’t confident in their legitimacy. Overall, they were leery of following low risk scores for defendants accused of offenses like sexual assault and intimate partner violence — sometimes because they believed the algorithms under- or over-weighted various risk factors, but also because their own reputations were on the line. And conversely, some described using the systems to explain why they’d made an unpopular decision — believing the risk scores added authoritative weight. “Many judges deployed their own moral views about specific charges as yardsticks to decide when risk scores were and were not legitimate in the eyes of the law.” The interviews revealed recurring patterns in judges’ decisions to use risk assessment scores, frequently based on defendants’ criminal history or social background. Some judges believed the systems underestimated the importance of certain red flags — like extensive juvenile records or certain kinds of gun charges — or overemphasized factors like an old criminal record or low education level. “Many judges deployed their own moral views about specific charges as yardsticks to decide when risk scores were and were not legitimate in the eyes of the law,” Esthappan writes. Some judges also said they used the scores as a matter of efficiency. These pretrial hearings are short — often less than five minutes — and require snap decisions based on limited information. The algorithmic score at least provides one more factor to consider. Judges also, however, were keenly aware of how a decision would reflect on them — and according to Esthappan, this was a huge factor in whether they trusted risk scores. When judges saw a charge they believed to be less of a public safety issue and more of a result of poverty or addiction, they would often defer to risk scores, seeing a small risk to their own reputation if they got it wrong and viewing their role, as one judge described it, as calling “balls and strikes,” rather than becoming a “social engineer.”  For high-level charges that involved some sort of moral weight, like rape or domestic violence, judges said they were more likely to be skeptical. This was partly because they identified problems with how the system weighted information for specific crimes — in intimate partner violence cases, for instance, they believed even defendants without a long criminal history could be dangerous. But they also recognized that the stakes — for themselves and others — were higher. “Your worst nightmare is you let someone out on a lower bond and then they go and hurt someone. I mean, all of us, when I see those stories on the news, I think that could have been any of us,” said one judge quoted in the study.   Keeping a truly low-risk defendant in jail has costs, too. It keeps someone who’s unlikely to harm anyone away from their job, their school, or their family before they’ve been convicted of a crime. But there’s little reputational risk for judges — and adding a risk score doesn’t change that calculus.  The deciding factor for judges often wasn’t whether the algorithm seemed trustworthy, but whether it would help them justify a decision they wanted to make. Judges who released a defendant based on a low risk score, for instance, could “shift some of that accountability away from themselves and towards the score,” Esthappan said. If an alleged victim “wants someone locked up,” one subject said, “what you’ll do as the judge is say ‘We’re guided by a risk assessment that scores for success in the defendant’s likelihood to appear and rearrest. And, based on the statute and this score, my job is to set a bond that protects others in the community.’”  “In practice, risk scores expand the uses of discretion among judges who strategically use them to justify punitive sanctions” Esthappan’s study pokes holes in the idea that algorithmic tools result in fairer, more consistent decisions. If judges are picking when to rely on scores based on factors like reputational risk, Esthappan notes, they may not be reducing human-driven bias — they could actually be legitimizing that bias and making it hard to spot. “Whereas policymakers tout their ability to curb judicial discretion, in practice, risk scores expand the uses of discretion among judges who strategically use them to justify punitive sanctions,” Esthappan writes in the study.  Megan Stevenson, an economist and criminal justice scholar at the University of Virginia School of Law, says risk assessments are something of “a technocratic toy of policymakers and academics.” She says it’s seemed to be an attractive tool to try to “take the randomness and the uncertainty out of this process,” but based on studies of their impact, they often don’t have a major effect on outcomes either way. A larger problem is that judges are forced to work with highly limited time and information. Berk, the University of Pennsylvania professor, says collecting more and better information could help the algorithms make better assessments. But that would require time and resources court systems may not have.  But when Esthappan interviewed public defenders, they raised an even more fundamental question: should pretrial detention, in its current form, exist at all? Judges aren’t just working with spotty data. They’re determining someone’s freedom before that person even gets a chance to fight their charges, often based on predictions that are largely guesswork. “Within this context, I think it makes sense that judges would rely on a risk assessment tool because they have so limited information,” Esthappan tells The Verge. “But on the other hand, I sort of see it as a bit of a distraction.”  Algorithmic tools are aiming to address a real issue with imperfect human decision-making. “The question that I have is, is that really the problem?” Esthappan tells The Verge. “Is it that judges are acting in a biased way, or is there something more structurally problematic about the way that we’re hearing people at pretrial?” The answer, he says, is that “there’s an issue that can’t necessarily be fixed with risk assessments, but that it goes into a deeper cultural issue within criminal courts.”  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Elizabeth Lopatto, a reporter who writes about tech, money, and human behavior. She joined The Verge in 2014 as science editor. Previously, she was a reporter at Bloomberg.  It is my personal belief that no normal person should know the name of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s chair, and yet here I am, about to explain why he’s been an issue in the 2024 presidential election. The man in question is Gary Gensler, an economist who formerly worked at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As SEC chair, he has been on the receiving end of death threats. Former President and current Republican nominee Donald Trump made a campaign promise to “fire Gary Gensler” to the raucous approval of a packed arena at this year’s Bitcoin Conference. Though blockchain enthusiasts have been the most vocal in their displeasure, the controversy around Gensler isn’t limited to them. The Economist has dubbed Gensler “the most controversial man in American finance”; House Democrats and Republicans have expressed “stern displeasure” on Gensler’s crypto approach. You could say he is unpopular. Many industries dislike their regulators. It is arguably the job of the SEC commissioner to be somewhat unpopular! And the cryptocurrency industry’s revulsion for Gensler is unsurprising after a series of SEC enforcements, including against major companies and exchanges. But Gensler himself became a contentious, oddly partisan issue on the level of presidential politics. And the story gets more complicated from there because this is not a cut-and-dried case of a regulator being persecuted by the industry for doing his job. Gensler is also unpopular among his own staff, though not for any reasons that will get thousands of people roaring inside a convention center.  It’s unusual for the SEC to be a hot-button issue — even during the 2008 financial crisis, the SEC chair wasn’t exactly a well-known figure. (The chair at the time was Christopher Cox. Yes, literally who.) But the SEC has become politically heated because Gensler wanted it to be, says Adam Pritchard, a professor of securities law at the University of Michigan. “He wanted to raise the profile of the agency,” says Pritchard, pointing to what he says is “an ambitious rulemaking agenda.” Let’s review some very recent history: Gensler’s time at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the agency that regulates derivatives markets. Gensler was in charge of the CFTC in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, during which he successfully convinced Congress to include, as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, new rules involving swaps (a type of financial derivative that was implicated in the crisis) that put them under the purview of the CFTC. His approach at that agency was described using words such as “hard-charging” and “aggressive.”  Before Dodd-Frank, the CFTC’s oversight was just the $35 trillion futures market; after, it was responsible for the $400 trillion swaps market as well. But taking on new duties also meant a lot of new work. The CFTC had to write a lot of new rules, and real people had to clock in hours to make that happen. On top of that, his enforcement chief filed “a record number of cases” against Wall Street banks. As a result of the speed and confusion with which the CFTC was working, the staff had to issue “130 exemptions or no-action letters,” essentially saying no enforcement action should be taken despite the existence of a new rule. He built up a reputation as a micromanager Under Gensler’s leadership, the CFTC outspent its budget and sometimes had to put employees on unpaid leave. At the same time, he built up a reputation as a micromanager. Gensler “routinely demanded that staff work weekends and holidays,” according to the Partnership for Public Service, which named the CFTC as one of the worst places in government to work while Gensler was at the helm.  Gensler’s management style left much to be desired; it also left the CFTC with a considerable amount of unoccupied real estate. Office space at the CFTC surged by almost 75 percent during his tenure. “Gensler signed leases across the country, assuming he would be able to fill the offices with new staff,” noted Fortune. But the funding for that staff never came, and by 2016, a fifth of the agency’s headquarters in DC remained unoccupied — as did almost a third of the New York office.  The playbook Gensler has been using at the SEC looks similar. Here, too, he’s been known for his hard-driving ethos. His two highest-profile issues, environmental disclosures and crypto, have earned him enemies in the Republican Party.  Under the SEC’s new rules around environmental disclosures, companies are required to disclose risks related to climate change. (Those rules have been paused in the face of an onslaught of lawsuits — part of a larger-scale attack on the regulatory state via the courts.)  “I don’t imagine a lot of voters are up in arms about public companies being forced to disclose the impact their policies have on the environment,” says Marc Fagel, who spent more than a decade at the SEC and who is now a lecturer at Stanford Law School. But because Republicans have been complaining about “ESG,” and “woke Wall Street,” this otherwise anodyne set of rules is now part of the culture wars.   But it’s Gensler’s record on crypto that makes his haters really froth at the mouth.  The division between the CFTC and the SEC is peculiar; in most other countries, there’s just one financial regulator. That division is a crucial part of the crypto story; the industry’s preferred regulator is the CFTC. But in the absence of a congressional mandate, a turf war has ensued, with the SEC filing enforcement actions against Coinbase and Binance, two of the largest exchanges, in 2023, claiming the exchanges allowed users to trade unregistered securities.  The SEC under both Gensler and his predecessor had some significant wins; it litigated or settled almost 200 crypto cases since 2017, Gensler told Barron’s in May. In March, a judge found that the suit against Coinbase could go forward — saying the SEC had sufficiently shown “that Coinbase operates as an exchange, as a broker, and as a clearing agency under the federal securities laws, and, through its Staking Program, engages in the unregistered offer and sale of securities.” Gensler has said outright that crypto is “rife with fraud, scams, bankruptcies and money laundering” Meanwhile, Gensler has said outright that crypto is “rife with fraud, scams, bankruptcies and money laundering” — not in and of itself a controversial opinion but one that maybe comes off a touch more outspoken than the typical federal bureaucrat. Maybe to drive the point home, he’s taken a number of crypto companies to task with enforcement actions, which include but are not limited to lawsuits. This is a sore point for the crypto industry, which has complained that the SEC isn’t making rules, just punishing companies, and doing so without providing clear guidance about how to avoid punishment. When the crypto exchange Coinbase requested that the SEC draft comprehensive rules for the crypto industry, the SEC rejected its petition. Coinbase then filed a legal challenge, saying the SEC’s denial was “arbitrary and capricious,” one of the legal standards for overturning an agency action.  Before I say more, let’s go over that again: one of the biggest crypto exchanges asked for more regulation, and then the regulatory agency in question — run by a man who says crypto is full of scams and frauds — said no. That seems pretty absurd on the face of it. Keep in mind, however, that there’s some weird legal crossfire in the timeline. Coinbase’s suit against the SEC over rulemaking was happening at the same time as the SEC’s suit against Coinbase over unregistered securities. And on top of that, there’s an additional complication: regulation just isn’t what it used to be. “The conservative judiciary has limited rulemaking,” says Fagel, the former SEC staffer. (The Supreme Court kneecapped regulators earlier this summer as part of an ongoing trend toward disempowering federal agencies.) “Yes, the SEC could spend three years concocting an entire regulatory regime for crypto. There would be a lawsuit in an hour.”  “Yes, the SEC could spend three years concocting an entire regulatory regime for crypto. There would be a lawsuit in an hour.” It might be more realistic to think of Coinbase’s suit as not asking for regulation per se, but as asking for regulation that Coinbase likes. Because if Coinbase doesn’t like said regulation, it’ll sue. Meanwhile, the courts have tended to back the SEC when it sues or takes enforcement actions — as opposed to rulemaking or other agency decision-making — so, rationally speaking, it’s just good sense for the SEC to focus on doing the things that judges let them do.  Gensler’s approach would be defensible, except that the SEC hasn’t abandoned rulemaking. In just the first eight months of 2022, the SEC proposed more than twice as many new rules as in 2021, and more than had been proposed annually for the last five years, according to an SEC inspector general report.  “There’s no question that the rulemaking initiatives have come fast and furious since he took over at the SEC,” says Pritchard. That means that the number of challenges to the rules has also spiked. Crafting rules that will withstand challenges is time-intensive, creating a feedback loop of more work for the staff, Pritchard says. This is the part that makes Gensler’s SEC start to look a lot like Gensler’s CFTC, and not in a good way. As a result of the pace of rulemaking, attrition rates at the SEC were the highest in 10 years, the 2022 inspector general report said. Managers told the SEC inspector general that it had been harder to hire people with experience, so the agency was relying on temporary workers, “in some cases with little or no experience in rulemaking.”  According to the SEC union, staff have been leaving “at more than twice the rate prior to Gensler’s arrival, and the pace of departures is continuing to accelerate.” The people who were most likely to leave were the most experienced. The SEC staff has experienced benefit cuts, which the union chalks up to “a series of budget decisions made by Chair Gensler,” who chose to increase spending, betting that Congress would increase the SEC’s budget. “In effect, Chair Gensler wagered with your compensation and benefits, knowing that his staff would suffer the consequences if he lost the bet,” the union told its membership. (Congress did not increase the SEC’s budget, and Gensler did in fact lose this bet.)  The union has also decried Gensler’s “irrational hostility” to remote work, adding that “the union is being forced to litigate issues like this more frequently under Chair Gensler than under any previous SEC Chairman.” Overwork and staff attrition have heavy consequences when you’re the literal government. In March 2024, SEC attorneys were sanctioned by a judge for “gross abuse of power” in a crypto case involving a company called Digital Licensing (or, more familiarly, Debt Box). Following the sanctions, the Salt Lake City offices of the SEC were closed because of “significant attrition” — and while the Debt Box fiasco wasn’t the only reason it closed, it did play a role. Attorney sanctions are relatively rare, and sanctions of government lawyers are even more so.  The SEC chair term lasts five years, meaning Gensler’s time is up in June 2026. But regardless of who is elected, Gensler’s tenure may not continue into the next administration. Gensler has said he would “absolutely” stay for a second term under Biden, when Biden was still the Democratic nominee. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has targeted him specifically, with the former president saying he would “fire” Gensler. Vice President Kamala Harris’ donors have also been pushing to get rid of Gensler. Her exact stance on Gensler as a regulator isn’t clear, but Gensler is closely associated with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and the relationship between Warren and Harris has been tense. Legally, the president can fire SEC chairs — but the chair then becomes a normal SEC commissioner. In that case, they can only be removed for cause, says Anne Joseph O’Connell, a law professor at Stanford Law School. (Typically, though, chairs resign when a new party is elected, while the regular commissioners carry on.) It’s unclear what would happen in the case of a Harris administration — intraparty transitions don’t happen very often. Gensler is a symptom, not the disease It’s funny. There’s reason to think that Gensler is, in fact, bad at his job. But when the crypto industry calls for Gensler to get fired, it’s probably not because it’s concerned about the work-life balance of the SEC staff. The same people who want Gensler’s head on a platter are the least likely people in America to find common cause with the SEC union. And given the polarization in American politics, when Gensler is demonized by the crypto industry (and lumped in with the actually effective Lina Khan by the business class), he comes out looking good to a certain set of half-informed liberals. The real story here is the paralyzed regulatory state. The legislative chambers that could have increased the SEC’s budget and mitigated its problems of too much rulemaking with too little staff are gridlocked. (Maybe Gensler’s chaotic leadership would have rendered that a null effort, but it’s hard to say for sure.) As for the problems with what is sometimes termed “regulation by enforcement,” that’s exactly the incentive structure the right wing has set up by kneecapping agencies’ abilities to set rules. Gensler is a symptom, not the disease. When the SEC makes rules, it gets tied up in court, and so even when the industry wants rules, it’s not going to get them. Strong regulation isn’t nearly as dangerous for corporations as unpredictability is. Go ahead and fire Gensler — who cares? The next SEC chair isn’t going to be able to set predictable guidelines, either.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "\nThis article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.\n      We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site.\n     The Roborock Q7 Max+ robot vacuum cleaner is currently available at an incredible price of $359 down from its original $869 – which is a staggering 59% discount that matches the Prime Day offer and sets a new record low. This deal makes one of our favorite robot vacuums even more attractive, especially considering its impressive features and outstanding value for money. See at Amazon The Roborock Q7 Max+ stands out in the crowded robot vacuum market with its Auto-Empty Dock Pure which allows for up to 7 weeks of hands-free cleaning. This docking station automatically empties the robot’s dustbin after each cleaning session and stores debris in a 2.5L dust bag. This means you can essentially “set it and forget it” for nearly two months. One of the great aspects of the Q7 Max+ is its powerful 4200Pa suction. This high-powered suction easily lifts debris and pet hair from various surfaces including hardwood floors and carpets. The vacuum’s intelligent design allows it to automatically increase suction when it detects carpets to keep it clean across different floor types. But this Roborock Q7 Max Plus isn’t just a vacuum – it’s a cleaning machine that offers both vacuuming and mopping capabilities. With an electronic pump and 30 water flow levels, you can customize the mopping intensity to suit different floor types and cleaning needs. This dual functionality is effective at removing fine dust that vacuuming alone might miss. Navigation is another area where the Q7 Max+ excels. Using PreciSense LiDAR technology, it creates precise maps of your home to optimize cleaning routes and it even offers 3D viewing. You can add furniture and floor materials to recreate your home virtually. This advanced mapping system ensures that no spot is missed and that the robot doesn’t waste time cleaning areas unnecessarily. The Q7 Max+ also boasts a combined dustbin and water tank with a 470 ml dustbin and 350 ml water tank. This larger capacity means you can clean more without needing to empty or refill as frequently. The upgraded brush system features an all-rubber brush that strongly resists hair tangles. Battery life is another strong point of the Q7 Max+. With its super-sized battery, it can clean for up to 180 minutes on a single charge and covers a maximum vacuuming range of 3229 sqft. Even larger homes can be cleaned in one go without the need for recharging.

            "content": "Archaeologists using an old map of Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula have uncovered a lost Maya city, hidden until now, with thousands of buildings densely packed into a small area. The archaeological team used a lidar survey (shorthand for “light detection and ranging”, a staple of modern archaeological techniques) to identify nearly 7,000 previously undiscovered structures, including pyramids like those found elsewhere in Central America. The team’s research, detailing these findings, was published today in Antiquity. Lidar surveys are very useful in Mesoamerican archaeology, where swaths of jungle can quickly swallow up entire cities. Three years ago, a separate team mapped 30,000 square miles (78,000 square kilometers) of Mexico, constituting nearly 500 historic sites, and found that similar design patterns were used for cities across the region. Lidar can even shake up archaeologists’ understandings of thoroughly researched sites; in 2021, a lidar survey of Tikal, in Guatemala, revealed an previously unknown neighborhood complex on the sprawling site. However, lidar is expensive. That’s where an old map comes into play—a 2013 lidar survey of the region, to be specific, commissioned by a group monitoring carbon reservoirs in Mexico’s forests. The recent archaeological team got access to that data, saving them from a costly new scan of the region. The team interrogated the 2013 map for evidence of previously undocumented Maya settlements, and found more than they bargained for: 6,674 previously unknown structures in Campeche. “Our analysis not only revealed a picture of a region that was dense with settlements, but it also revealed a lot of variability,” said Luke Auld-Thomas, an archaeologist at Northern Arizona University and lead author of the paper, in an Antiquity press release. “We didn’t just find rural areas and smaller settlements. We also found a large city with pyramids right next to the area’s only highway, near a town where people have been actively farming among the ruins for years.” The data only covered a region of about 50 square miles (129 square kilometers), but the area was crammed with ancient architecture. The researchers also managed to identify specific structures in the lidar that made up the Mayan city, including a ballcourt and a dam. One architectural arrangement at one of the sites indicated a founding date earlier than 150 CE, according to a previous study. That slightly predates the Classic period of the Maya, which stretched from 250 CE to 900 CE. “The government never knew about it; the scientific community never knew about it,” Auld-Thomas said. “That really puts an exclamation point behind the statement that, no, we have not found everything, and yes, there’s a lot more to be discovered.” In the paper, the team noted that the recent data offered support to the previously stated concern that “archaeologically motivated lidar surveys have inflated estimates of regional settlement density.” “To the contrary, pseudorandom surveys—those combining expedient and random sampling—like this one, have established that anyone who is waiting for a sparsely settled Maya hinterland large enough to offset the high settlement densities documented by archaeological lidar surveys is running out of places to look,” the team added. To put it simply: The dataset recently used by the team was not collected with an archaeological objective in mind, but further supported previous ideas about Maya urban sites and their density. While lidar surveys are great for discovering sites and making conjectures about the layout of cities, the aerial approach to archaeology cannot replace good old-fashioned fieldwork. According to the Antiquity release, future research will focus on fieldwork at the sites. Given that there are nearly 7,000 structures in the area, that research could take some time. \naerial imagesCitiesLidarMaya  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Developers wants to build an urban hub within Toronto's boundaries using a defunct span of runway and hangar space.\n         \n          Will the singer's $6 billion metropolis, a \"real-life Wakanda,\" actually get built?

            "content": "Roborock is a pioneer and global leader in smart home robotics and has unveiled in April some new flagship products – the S8 Max Series. These cutting-edge robotic vacuum cleaners represent the pinnacle of home cleaning technology and showcase Roborock’s commitment to innovation and user-centric design. To demonstrate the exceptional durability, reliability and robustness of the S8 MaxV Ultra, Roborock partnered with Sent into Space for a groundbreaking experiment: sending the device into space. Roborock’s audacious mission to send its S8 MaxV Ultra vacuum into space highlights the company’s innovative spirit and commitment to pushing boundaries. This unprecedented venture, executed in collaboration with Sent Into Space, saw the robot vacuum ascend to an altitude of 120,000 feet, enduring temperatures as low as -76°F — an environment that would typically cause inferior batteries to lose charge or motors to freeze. The S8 MaxV Ultra didn’t just survive this extreme environment; it thrived and demonstrated its capabilities by activating features like the DuoRoller brush system and responding to voice commands at the edge of space. “We aimed to demonstrate our product’s resilience like never before in the industry. Witnessing our vacuum soar 120,000 feet above Earth was an extraordinary moment, symbolizing how far Roborock has come in redefining the smart home experience,” said Roborock’s North American marketing team. When Roborock decided to send its S8 MaxV Ultra on a journey to the edge of space, eyebrows were raised. A vacuum cleaner in space? It almost sounds like the plot of a sci-fi comedy. But for Roborock, this wasn’t about getting laughs — it was about pushing boundaries and challenging perceptions. By testing the vacuum in the extreme conditions of near-space, Roborock aimed to demonstrate that their technology can handle challenges far beyond everyday cleaning tasks. Rocky to mission control, we have liftoff 🚀Here’s the first look at the moment the S8 MaxV Ultra began its ascent toward the stars and into the history books.  Cleaning beyond limits ✅First robot vacuum in space ✅#BeyondLimits #Roborock #S8MaxVUltra pic.twitter.com/eiO9zzSb33 — Roborock (@roborockglobal) October 6, 2024  Upon its return to Earth, the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra proved its resilience and functionality: after enduring the harsh environment of space, the vacuum came back fully operational. Of course, engineers had made specific modifications to integrate the vacuum with the flight computer, enabling features like the DuoRoller brush system and voice commands at incredible altitudes. While these adjustments meant it wouldn’t operate exactly like a typical Roborock vacuum, its core capabilities remained intact which is a true proof the quality and adaptability of Roborock’s engineering. Beyond its technical achievements, the space mission embodies Roborock’s “Cleaning Beyond Limits” philosophy. It challenges conventional notions of what home appliances can achieve and inspires consumers to reimagine the possibilities of smart home technology. For sure, the success of this mission reinforces Roborock’s position as an industry leader and proves that their products are engineered to withstand challenges far beyond typical household use: if the S8 MaxV Ultra can conquer space, it can handle any cleaning task on Earth with ease.

            "content": "\nThis article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.\n      We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site.\n     Amazon Prime Day is just about upon us, and even though it doesn’t technically start until tomorrow October 8th and end October 9th, there are still already a number of excellent opportunities to start saving. You might be after a new iPhone or perhaps a 4K TV. Maybe you’re hoping to find a good deal on a pair of noise-canceling headphones. See at Amazon I wish you the best in finding those deals, but right now here’s something you may not have realized you’re interested in — and that is a portable printer which is apparently over 90% off. It’s list price says $1,000, and right now it’s just $100. There’s also a coupon to save another $7 so you can get it for just $93. Let’s talk about the elephant in the room for a second. It this thing really worth a thousand dollars? The list price is stated over on Amazon for $1,000. This is true. Right now it’s 90% off with a current prince of $100 (minus the coupon savings). However, a quick peak into its price history — as of the time of writing this — the portable printer has been on Amazon for 216 days. It launched at the “discounted price” of $260 and then after its first month, dropped down to $140 where since it’s mostly flipped back and forth between being that price and $100. So really, I would call this a $140 portable printer that occasionally goes on sale for $100 or under — and right now is one of those occasions! This is all for the black model of the printer. There is also a brown version and that one actually is listed for $1,000 and has been since it hit Amazon. The only discernable difference is that one of them is black and one of them is brown. So if you were really hoping to have a portable printer in brown, I’d recommend getting it in black and then also purchasing this can of brown spray paint for six bucks. I cannot comment on how spray painting the printer will affect or not affect its performance. This small printer weighs only two pounds and is about the size of two mobile phones. It uses thermal paper so doesn’t require any ink or toner cartridges to print. Connect to it over Bluetooth and you’ll be able to print wirelessly on-the-go in black and white. Honestly, I think this is an especially handy too if you’re someone like me who doesn’t print anything but the occasional shipping label. Despite what it’s real price is, right now it’s the lowest it ever gets on Amazon so that’s still a pretty good deal. Get the 90% off thermal portable printer for just $93 after clipping the coupon.

            "content": "A global tech industry group devoted to ending the internet’s dependence on passwords has released a set of resources that it hopes will usher in a new paradigm for how we sign in to things online. The Fast Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance—which is composed of tech companies, password managers, retailers, and government agencies—believes that passwords are insecure and inconvenient, pointing to the large number of users who forget passwords, reuse passwords across sites, and have their passwords compromised in data breaches or phishing attacks. Instead, the alliance would like everybody to use passkeys. A passkey is a form of public key cryptography that replaces account usernames and passwords with random strings of data. Those cryptographic keys are stored in an authenticator, which is similar to a password manager and can only be unlocked by the same method a person uses to unlock their phone or other device—for example, facial recognition, thumbprint detection, or a PIN. When you sign in to a website with a passkey, you’re prompted to unlock your device, at which point the authenticator sends the website the cryptographic key necessary to log in to your account. Confused? On Monday, the FIDO Alliance published Passkey Central, an online guide explaining how the technology works and why everyone should be using it. At the same time, the organization released draft credential exchange specifications aimed at standardizing the way organizations transfer user credentials like passkeys between each other, so that users can move their log in information between devices, operating systems, and password managers without compromising their security. More than 13 billion online accounts—across platforms like Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nintendo, PayPal, and TikTok—are currently able to use passkeys, according to the FIDO Alliance. The group hopes that Passkey Central will spread awareness and provide all the information other businesses need to implement the new system on their websites. “Our adversaries attack nations in cyberspace using techniques that are blocked by passkeys and related technologies. We need to do what we can to accelerate passkey adoption, and to help regular people understand that passkeys protect countries, and make their online lives a little easier,” Craig Newmark, founder of Craig Newmark Philanthropies, which helped underwrite the Passkey Central project, said in a statement. \npasskeysPasswords  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          It's now syncing passkeys across almost all your devices hoping for a \"passwordless future.\"\n         \n          Just as Google kills off its Google One VPN service, it will now help all account holders discover if their SSN or password is leaked online.\n         \n           \n         \n           \n         \n           \n         \n           \n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

The current deal offers a massive discount across multiple screen sizes and what’s exciting is that it’s accessible to all customers, not just Prime members. With this level of accessibility, these TVs are likely to sell out at lightning speed, so quick make sure you snag this deal before it runs out of stock. The star of the Prime Day show is undoubtedly the 65-inch LG C4 OLED TV which is now priced at a jaw-dropping $1,496 down from its original $2,699. This whopping $1,200 discount is a massive 45% discount and makes it one of the most compelling offers of this Prime Day event. But the deals don’t stop there – the entire C4 series lineup is seeing significant price cuts. See 65″ LG TV at Amazon See 65″ LG TV at Amazon These prices rival and in some cases surpass the best deals typically seen during Black Friday and offer consumers a rare opportunity to make substantial savings on top-tier TV technology. Remember LG is one of the best players for OLED technology and this C4 model features over 8 million self-lit pixels that deliver an unparalleled viewing experience. For gaming enthusiasts, the C4 series is nothing else than a dream come true. This LG OLED TV boasts a 144Hz refresh rate and a lightning-fast 0.1ms response time that guarantees ultra-smooth gameplay free from screen tearing and stuttering.

The Filmmaker Mode is another standout feature from this LG OLED TV available at Prime Day and allows users to watch films exactly as directors intended by preserving original aspect ratios, colors and frame rates.

It’s worth noting that deals of this magnitude on such high-quality TVs are rare outside of major shopping events.

However, as with all Prime Day deals, especially those open to all shoppers, stock is likely to deplete rapidly. The combination of record-low prices, top-tier technology and universal accessibility means these TVs could sell out in record time.

These premium headphones are renowned for their exceptional sound quality, industry-leading active noise cancellation (ANC) and comfort and they’re perfect for audiophiles. The Sony WH-1000XM4 is originally priced at $348 but it’s now available for an astonishing $198, representing a 43% discount. This model has long been celebrated for its exceptional noise-canceling capabilities and very premium sound quality. With up to 30 hours of battery life and quick charging features, these headphones are perfect for long listening sessions or travel. See WH-1000XM4 at Amazon Meanwhile, the newer Sony WH-1000XM5 has also received a significant price cut, and they’re now available for $298 down from its original price of $399.

See WH-1000XM5 at Amazon Both models offer impressive features and include adaptive noise cancellation that adjusts to your environment, speak-to-chat technology that automatically pauses audio when you start speaking and multipoint connection for seamless switching between devices. The WH-1000XM5, however, takes these features a step further with improved processors and microphones. Is it worth the $100 difference though? Not sure. In terms of design, the WH-1000XM5 features a sleeker and slightly more modern look compared to the XM4. However, it’s worth noting that the XM5 doesn’t fold up as compactly as the XM4, which might be a consideration for frequent travelers. Sound quality is exceptional on both models, but the XM5 edges out its predecessor with slightly clearer and more detailed audio. The XM5 also boasts a more comfortable fit, with deeper, plush earcups and a softer headband.

These prices are some of the lowest ever observed for these models and offer an unparalleled opportunity to own premium audio equipment at a fraction of their usual cost.

This advanced robotic vacuum cleaner combines cutting-edge technology with exceptional value and offers a cleaning experience that’s hard to match at this price point. At the heart of the S8+ is the innovative DuoRoller Brush system which features dual rubber brushes that enhance vacuuming efficiency and reduce hair tangles.

Complementing this is the VibraRise Mopping system which utilizes sonic vibration technology to scrub floors up to 3000 times per minute with 6N of consistent downward pressure.

This feature significantly reduces the frequency of manual intervention, you can almost forget it.

The current deal offers a massive discount across multiple screen sizes and what’s exciting is that it’s accessible to all customers, not just Prime members. With this level of accessibility, these TVs are likely to sell out at lightning speed, so quick make sure you snag this deal before it runs out of stock. The star of the Prime Day show is undoubtedly the 65-inch LG C4 OLED TV which is now priced at a jaw-dropping $1,496 down from its original $2,699. This whopping $1,200 discount is a massive 45% discount and makes it one of the most compelling offers of this Prime Day event. But the deals don’t stop there – the entire C4 series lineup is seeing significant price cuts. See 65″ LG TV at Amazon See 65″ LG TV at Amazon These prices rival and in some cases surpass the best deals typically seen during Black Friday and offer consumers a rare opportunity to make substantial savings on top-tier TV technology. Remember LG is one of the best players for OLED technology and this C4 model features over 8 million self-lit pixels that deliver an unparalleled viewing experience. For gaming enthusiasts, the C4 series is nothing else than a dream come true. This LG OLED TV boasts a 144Hz refresh rate and a lightning-fast 0.1ms response time that guarantees ultra-smooth gameplay free from screen tearing and stuttering. The inclusion of the powerful NVIDIA G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium compatibility ensures that gamers can enjoy their favorite titles without interruptions. With four HDMI 2.1 inputs available, connecting multiple gaming consoles is a breeze. The audio capabilities of the C4 series are equally impressive: support for Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos brings a cinematic sound experience right into your living room. The Filmmaker Mode is another standout feature from this LG OLED TV available at Prime Day and allows users to watch films exactly as directors intended by preserving original aspect ratios, colors and frame rates. Given the current massive discounts and the impressive feature set of the C4 series, this Prime Day deal is probably the best value propositions in the TV market today. Whether you’re a movie enthusiast looking for stunning visuals, a serious gamer or simply in the market for a premium TV to elevate your home entertainment system, the LG OLED evo C4 Series (at this price) is a no-brainer. It’s worth noting that deals of this magnitude on such high-quality TVs are rare outside of major shopping events. With prices matching or beating typical Black Friday offers, this Prime Day is a great chance to upgrade your viewing experience without waiting for the holiday season. However, as with all Prime Day deals, especially those open to all shoppers, stock is likely to deplete rapidly. The combination of record-low prices, top-tier technology and universal accessibility means these TVs could sell out in record time.

            "content": "An old and powerful force has entered the fraught debate over generative AI in schools: litigious parents angry that their child may not be accepted into a prestigious university. In what appears to be the first case of its kind, at least in Massachusetts, a couple has sued their local school district after it disciplined their son for using generative AI tools on a history project. Dale and Jennifer Harris allege that the Hingham High School student handbook did not explicitly prohibit the use of AI to complete assignments and that the punishment visited upon their son for using an AI tool—he received Saturday detention and a grade of 65 out of 100 on the assignment—has harmed his chances of getting into Stanford University and other elite schools. “The defendants continued on a pervasive, destructive and merciless path of threats, intimidation and coercion to impact and derail [our son’s] future and his exemplary record,” the Harris family alleges in its lawsuit, which was initially filed in state superior court before being removed to a federal district court. Hingham Public Schools, however, claims that its student handbook prohibited the use of “unauthorized technology” and “unauthorized use or close imitation of the language and thoughts of another author and the representation of them as one’s own work.” The district said in a recent motion to dismiss that the discipline administered to the Harris’ son was “relatively lenient” and that a ruling to the contrary would “invite dissatisfied parents and students to challenge day-to-day discipline, even grading of students, in state and federal courts.” Almost immediately after OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022,  schools recognized the threat that free and easily accessible generative AI tools posed to academic integrity. Some districts tried banning the technology entirely for students and then reversed course. State departments of education have slowly been rolling out guidance for local districts, but in many parts of the country, there is no clear consensus on how students should be allowed to use generative AI. A national survey conducted by the Center for Democracy and Technology found that schools are increasingly disciplining students for using AI and noted that historically marginalized students—including students of color and English language learners—tend to be punished disproportionately for violating school rules, The Harris family alleges that their son was unfairly targeted by the Hingham school district because it applied discipline inconsistently. After the cheating incident, the district didn’t place their son in the National Honor Society, they claim, but it had previously allowed a student who used AI to write an English paper to join the society. The district replied in its motion to dismiss that the Harris’s son has, in fact, been allowed to join the National Honor Society after initially being deferred. The lawsuit also questions whether using AI to complete assignments should be prohibited at all. It notes that the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education hasn’t issued any rules or guidance for schools on the use of the technology. “Generative AI is an emerging landscape and its use is here to stay,” according to the lawsuit. \ngenerative aiMassachusetts  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The social media giant's Creator Bonus Program has created a world where AI-generated spam is a business.\n         \n          As is the case with genAI in other industries, comics pros are not happy about the technology intruding on their space.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

What sets Babbel apart from its competitors is its team of over 150 language experts who meticulously craft each lesson. These professionals make sure that the content is not only linguistically precise but also culturally relevant and engaging.
