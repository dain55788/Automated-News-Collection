Please also consider subscribing to WIRED Amazon’s humble Kindle has had a bit of a resurgence, partly thanks to #BookTok—the community of TikTok users who discuss literature, book lists, and, among other things, ways to deck out Kindle ebook readers with accessories. Amazon says Kindle sales have grown in double-digit percentages for the past two years, which probably explains why the company is announcing four new Kindles today—the first time it has unveiled this many new models in a single moment. Amazon’s device and services lead Panos Panay, who used to run Microsoft's Surface division, didn't shy away from flaunting just how popular Kindles have become during a hardware briefing on Tuesday. On Kindle devices, users read an average of 20.8 billion pages per month. Sixty percent of Kindle device sales in 2023 came from first-time customers. “Seeing the highest sales of Kindle in over a decade, customers are reading more than ever,” Panay says. “It’s almost like, thank goodness, because I thought we forgot how to read.” It has been a few years since the popular gadget—now in its 17th year—received a massive facelift across all its models. The most recent Kindle Paperwhite (11th generation) launched in 2021, while the entry-level Kindle (11th Gen), Kindle Scribe, and Kindle Kids came out in 2022. Within that time, competitors like Kobo and Boox have released competing models with color e-paper displays, page-turn buttons (a feature we haven't seen on a Kindle since the Oasis), stylus support, and more. To catch up, Amazon has four new Kindles: Kindle (12th Gen), Kindle Paperwhite (12th Gen), Kindle Scribe (2nd Gen), and the all-new Kindle Colorsoft—its first-ever color e-reader. Panay calls it “the largest shift of the Kindle lineup in years.\" Color electronic paper displays have hit the ground running this year with devices like the Kobo Libra Colour and the ReMarkable Paper Pro. But it's safe to say anticipation has been high for a color Kindle. With the Colorsoft, book covers, photos, and images will appear in color. You'll also be able to add color highlights in books, and these will be searchable, so you don't have to hunt through pages to find that paragraph you highlighted. The Colorsoft's features are very similar to the new Kindle Paperwhite (see below), but Amazon says the display technology is more intricate. The 7-inch display has an oxide backplane that Amazon says will deliver speedy performance and a higher contrast on color and black-and-white content. To keep the colors from bleeding together and maintain accuracy, the company had to fiddle with the front light and used nitride LEDs to enhance color and increase brightness. You can choose between standard or vibrant color styles and zoom in on images (without pixelation). Fast page turns are the next big addition here, but there still are no dedicated page-turn buttons on the device. You get support for Qi wireless charging and up to eight weeks of battery life. It comes with the same auto-adjust light found on the Kindle Signature Paperwhite, which automatically adjusts the screen's brightness based on your environment. The Kindle Colorsoft costs $280 and is available for preorder now. It ships on October 30. The basic Kindle gets the tiniest update of all these devices. It remains the company's smallest and most affordable Kindle model. Since its predecessor launched in 2022—with a higher-resolution screen (300 pixels per inch versus 167 PPI), double the storage (from 8 gigabytes to 16), and a USB-C port—the latest version doesn't come with many new upgrades. The major changes include a faster page-turn rate so there's less delay while reading, a higher contrast ratio so that text looks both crisper and clearer, and a 25 percent brighter front light at the highest setting. This model still doesn't come with auto-adjusting light or warm lighting. The latter is especially disappointing, as a Kindle's major selling point is the capability to read at night without a lamp. For some people, the warm light feels easier on the eyes (especially before bed). It's an odd feature to gatekeep. It comes in a new Matcha color, which may be attributable to the popularity of the Agave Green Kindle Paperwhite. Since its launch last year, the green ebook reader has gone viral on TikTok and is often sold out on Amazon. But you can also buy the new Kindle in black for a more muted tone. The Kindle costs $110 (a $10 price bump over its predecessor), and you can order it now. It ships immediately. Amazon also launched a new Kindle Kids edition. It comes with all the same features as the standard version, including a faster page-turn rate, a higher contrast ratio, and a brighter screen. But it also comes with a kid-friendly case (Amazon released a few new designs, too), a year's subscription to Amazon Kids+ subscription (the kid-friendly content library), parental controls, and a two-year warranty. Amazon says the Kindle Paperwhite is “the most popular Kindle used today.” The company was careful not to make any drastic changes and improve on existing features. The finished product? It's the thinnest, fastest, and sharpest Paperwhite yet. The Paperwhite has 25 percent faster page turns to reduce lag while scrolling. The display is slightly larger. By shrinking the bezels around the screen, the company increased the display size from 6.8 inches to 7 inches without drastically changing the tablet's dimensions. It uses an oxide thin-film transistor, which Amazon says gives it the highest contrast ratio of any Kindle, delivering sharper text and images. Battery life is up too from a little more than two months to three months on a single charge. Like its predecessors, it's waterproof and includes 16 GB of storage. There's also the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, which has all the same features as the standard Paperwhite plus an auto-adjusting front light, wireless charging, and double the storage at 32 GB. Both versions also come in new colors including Metallic Raspberry, Metallic Jade, and Metallic Black. The Kindle Paperwhite and Paperwhite Signature Edition are available now for $160 and $200, respectively, and they ship immediately. Amazon also announced an all-new Kindle Paperwhite Kids. It has all the same features as the standard Paperwhite—it's faster, thinner, and brighter—but comes with kid-friendly cases, some of which feature new designs. It also comes with a year's subscription to Amazon Kids+ subscription (its kid-friendly content library), parental controls, and a two-year warranty. The second-generation Kindle Scribe, designed for note-taking and reading, comes with a few new features on the inside and out. The display sports white borders with a paper-like display to mimic the look of a traditional sheet of paper. Meanwhile, the Premium Pen (sold separately) now has a soft-tipped eraser that feels like the one you'd find on a No. 2 pencil. There are a few new software features in the Scribe too. There's Active Canvas, which allows you to write directly within the book you're reading (this was a big complaint we had with the original when we reviewed it). While making notes, it'll flow around the text and anchor the ink to the exact spot you annotated. That way, if you resize the text or the book layout changes, it won't lose its spot. In the future, you'll also be able to take advantage of expandable margins—so you can write in the side panel and hide the notes when you're done. And if you thought you were safe from generative artificial intelligence in a hardware launch story about Kindles, you were wrong. Say hello to “Refined Writing” and “Summarization.” With Refined Writing, you can tap a button to refine your notes into a script font so that it's legible but also looks more presentable. Summarization quickly summarizes pages of notes into bullets within a script font that you can share directly from the notebook tab. You can preorder the new Kindle Scribe now for $400, and it ships on December 4.

            "content": "By  Jay Peters, a news editor who writes about technology, video games, and virtual worlds. He’s submitted several accepted emoji proposals to the Unicode Consortium. Listening to Nintendo music isn’t easy. It’s not available on streaming platforms, so I usually end up scouring YouTube for songs from Animal Crossing and Metroid. Because of this, I was hoping that Nintendo Music, a new app that surprise-launched last week, would be my one-stop shop for listening to Nintendo soundtracks. But while it features some clever ideas, there are lots of frustrations and weird choices from Nintendo that mean it isn’t quite what I was hoping for.  Navigating the app, which is available on iOS and Android but only accessible to Switch Online subscribers, feels a lot like other music services like Apple Music or Spotify. You can browse tracks from individual games or hand-curated playlists themed around things like characters, Pokémon battle songs, or tracks you might want to listen to on an extended loop. It’s organized in a thoughtful way on a per-game basis. The fictional bands in Splatoon 3 all get artist pages with bios. The page for Animal Crossing: New Horizons features playlists for K.K. Slider performances and instrumentals, and if you want to listen to a full playlist of Kapp’n’s sea shanties, that’s available, too. The extended loop feature is my favorite part. For some songs, you can choose to extend them out to 15, 30, or 60 minutes. I’ve already used it quite a bit to work to music from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild; the calming piano sounds of “The Great Plateau” are still exquisite seven years later. I also like that you can add games to a “spoiler prevention” list to hide information about a game you might not have played yet, which could be a good way to keep yourself in the dark about a final boss for a game you might want to play. There just aren’t many games on the app But Nintendo Music doesn’t have many game soundtracks to listen to. Nintendo has more than 40 years’ worth of titles it could have included, and right now, there are only 25 games to pick from. There are just two Zelda games: Breath of the Wild and Ocarina of Time. Fire Emblem is the only Game Boy Advance game. There are three NES games, and two of them are Metroid. Technically, one of the “games” is Wii Channels music (which, to be fair, is full of bangers). I could go on, but the point is that Nintendo Music isn’t a comprehensive collection of the company’s enormous musical history. Given that most of the soundtracks are for Nintendo Switch games, it’s more of a collection of Nintendo’s recent musical history, but it seems like a huge miss that I can’t listen to anything from Super Mario World in the app. That will start to change, and probably slowly, if the drip-feed of Switch Online retro games is any indication. A day after the service launched, Nintendo added the soundtrack to Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and on Monday, Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy’s Kong Quest became available, too. In the Nintendo Music reveal trailer, the company showed that Wii Sports, Super Mario 64, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Splatoon 2, and F-Zero X are all set to arrive on the service, but only on a vague “over time” schedule. Nintendo Music also doesn’t credit the real humans involved in making a song. That means, curiously enough, that the fictional bands in Splatoon 3 have more prominence in Nintendo Music than the legendary Koji Kondo. (Nintendo has kind of a weird thing about credits at the moment.) The app has some other issues, too. You can’t extend some songs, and there’s no indication why, which is really annoying. One of the first songs I wanted to try the feature with was Metroid Prime’s soothing “Phendrana Drifts” music, but it’s not possible — which, given that it’s one of the main songs you hear on loop while exploring that area of the game, doesn’t make sense to me. Sure, you can just set the song to repeat, but that’s not quite the same as an hour-long extension. And when you select the duration of how long you want to extend a song, the whole song starts over; it’s a little thing, but I wish the app could just make the extension happen without the brief but jarring halt.  And disappointingly, Nintendo Music is currently only available on iOS and Android — there’s no desktop or web app. I’d really like to listen to Nintendo Music from a Mac app or in my desktop browser; it isn’t compatible with CarPlay or Android Auto, either. For the songs that are currently available, Nintendo Music is great. But so much is missing that part of me wonders if Nintendo pushed this service out the door ahead of the launch of the successor to the Switch so that it could add to the service later. It’s a similar feeling to the frustrations with other recent not-Switch things from Nintendo, like the Alarmo clock and skin-deep Nintendo Museum; they all have good ideas but also some weird limitations. Nintendo Music just isn’t as deep as I would like it to be. It means I’m going to have to keep tracking a lot of music down on YouTube.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Charles Pulliam-Moore, a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years. Juston Gordon-Montgomery grew up during the Attitude Era of pro wrestling — a time when the personalities were humongous, the storylines were wild, and the theater of it all bordered on high camp. Though it has gotten way easier to watch wrestling in the streaming era, the sport’s cultural dominance has waned in the years since it first captured Gordon-Montgomery’s imagination. Especially to non-fans, the idea of getting into wrestling can still feel a bit daunting. But that feeling is part of what inspired Gordon-Montgomery to create Invincible Fight Girl, a new series coming to Adult Swim. Invincible Fight Girl’s story about a young accountant named Andy (Sydney Mikayla) who dreams of becoming a legendary wrestler is the stuff of shonen classics like Dragon Ball Z and One Piece. But the show’s setting — a world where everyone is some sort of masked brawler with unique costumes and signature combat moves — feels like a loving send-up of the pro-wrestling culture that defined the sport throughout the late ’90s. On paper, Invincible Fight Girl’s blend of influences makes its premise sound a little busy, but you can immediately see the vision come together as soon as its characters step into the ring. When I recently sat down with Gordon-Montgomery to talk about Invincible Fight Girl, he told me that he wanted his love for the Attitude Era of wrestling to shine through “not just in Andy as a character, but the show as a whole.”  “Wrestling felt magical to me as a kid, but the characters and their backstories also felt real,” Gordon-Montgomery explained. “I fully believed that the Undertaker really was a dead guy. The Attitude Era felt like it lent itself to the question ‘What would a world be like if it was filled with pro wrestlers,’ because they would all be these very distinct, very clear characters with ideologies that would come through in how they speak and fight.” From the jump, Gordon-Montgomery knew he wanted to tell a story that both focused on someone chasing their passion and captured the feeling of getting swept up in the thrill of a wrestling match. Naturally, Invincible Fight Girl’s creative team took some cues from real-world wrestling. Because the show is all about a scrappy fighter training to be the best in a world full of magical people, though, anime series like Pokémon and Naruto were an obvious go-to source of inspiration. If those shows could spin entire worlds out of concepts like catching monsters and being a shinobi, Gordon-Montgomery felt he might be able to do something similar with pro wrestling. To really capture the spirit of wrestling, though, Gordon-Montgomery and his team found themselves looking to “one of the most fantastic pieces of media there is”: director Satoshi Nishimura’s 2000 adaptation of Hajime no Ippo. “I don’t know if a lot of people know about Hajime no Ippo, but it was the north star for us because, in that show, the fighting isn’t just fighting,” Gordon-Montgomery explained. “It’s a way to visualize philosophies clashing and illustrate how characters grow and change. So much of wrestling matches is just storytelling and pageantry, and it felt important to make sure that our fights weren’t just people hitting each other and pulling off moves that you recognize.” Early in the series, as Andy’s first striking out on her own, many of her go-to maneuvers are wrestling basics you might recognize from live-action matches because she’s a novice who learned everything she knows from instructional videos. Her skills level up as she meets new allies like elderly wrestling legend Quesa Poblana (Rolonda Watts) and aspiring journalist Mikey (T.K. Weaver). But Andy’s transformation into Invincible Fight Girl takes time, something many networks seem increasingly skittish about giving newer projects. When Gordon-Montgomery started in animation, he didn’t see Western studios producing a lot of serialized shows in the way he wanted Invincible Fight Girl to be. Protracted narratives that play out over the course of dozens of episodes are a hallmark of the anime Gordon-Montgomery was taking notes from, but he knew that pushing for that kind of story structure would be a challenge. “Especially because we’re in this era of shorter season orders, there was definitely some concern about, ‘How long are you trying to draw these plot beats and revelations out?’” Gordon-Montgomery told me. “But to the credit of our partners at the network, I think they understood our vision. We were able to really convey that this is how Andy’s story needed to be told in order for audiences to really experience it the way we intended.” Though Gordon-Montgomery doesn’t want to put a number to how many episodes he envisions Invincible Fight Girl running for just yet, he’s confident that the show’s core concept has legs akin to Pokémon’s. “Pokémon is kind of at a point where it’s just going to keep going forever, which isn’t quite what we want to do,” Gordon-Montgomery said. “But I think there’s a very, very long runway of different ideas that we’re exploring philosophically with Andy and this world we’ve created. There are a lot of things that haven’t been done in animation here that I see us doing if we get the shot.” Invincible Fight Girl premieres on Adult Swim on November 2nd.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

(If you’re new here, welcome, Batman forever, and also you can read all the old editions at the Installer homepage.)  This week, I’ve been reading about Simone Giertz and billionaire assistants and Checo Pérez and Call Her Daddy, learning about “Earthrise,” listening to Quinta Brunson and Conan O’Brien talk comedy, trying to decide whether to get super into Bluesky or just quit social altogether, and throwing myself into baseball so I can pretend I know what I’m talking about during the World Series. I also have for you an excellent new VR game, a delightful new reading gadget, a nice RSS reader update, a new browser worth trying, and much more.

I reviewed the new iPad Mini this week and, as a result, spent a bunch of time setting up a new tablet and thinking a lot about how to organize the homescreen. I’ve deliberately kept this space phone-centric so far, because I really think you can tell a lot about a person just by looking at their phone, but after spending all that time thinking about my iPad life, I’m wondering if I need to broaden the scope a little bit. Maybe I should get people to share, like, their computer desktops? Or their game console homescreens? Maybe the first screen of their smart TVs? I don’t know, there are a lot of homescreens out there. We’ll try some stuff. All that said, here’s my iPad Mini homescreen, plus some info on the apps I’m using and why: The tablet: iPad Mini, 2024. I love the iPad Mini. I wish this one were a lot better and that Apple would care about the Mini a lot more, but here we are. The wallpaper: Apple’s weather wallpaper, which adapts to the current weather outside. It’s a total gimmick, and I am shocked at how much I love it. The apps: Balatro, Madden, EA Sports FC, Retro Goal, Retro Bowl, Delta, Call of Duty: Warzone, Coffee Golf, Real Racing 3, Tiny Wings, NYT Games, The New York Times, Apple News, The Washington Post, Unread, Netflix, TikTok, Disney Plus, Prime Video, Sling, YouTube, Peacock, Max, Hulu, ESPN, Arc, Kindle, Workflowy, Readwise Reader, Pocket Casts, Spotify, Mela. I feel like there are two ways you can go with your iPad. You can use it to try and do laptop things, or you can decide to use your iPad mostly as a way to avoid doing laptop things. I’ve picked the latter: roughly 100 percent of my iPad use is reading, watching, and playing. I don’t have Gmail or Slack or Google Docs on here; nothing is allowed to send me notifications. My iPad is a place for relaxation and fun, period. I like and use all these apps, but there are a few to call out specifically: I’ve tried a lot of recipe apps, and Mela is still the simplest and the best at pulling recipes out of websites; Balatro is the most addicting game I’ve downloaded in years; I finally became an Apple News Plus subscriber and am blown away by how much I’m using it; the iPad Mini is the perfect tablet to use as a steering wheel, and Real Racing 3 is a fabulous driving game.  My dock is reserved for the apps I use at least close to every day, which means it’s reading, notes, recipes, podcasts, and music. (I just realized I should move Workflowy, so it’s not between the reading apps — I’ll get to that.) The most-used non-dock app right now is probably Peacock, which has Community and Parks and Recreation and Brooklyn Nine-Nine and is, thus, the streaming service I have on in the background basically all the time. For years, I tried to turn my iPad into something like a laptop replacement. But the more I’ve leaned into it being a purely recreational device, the screen for when I don’t want to be stressed out by screens, the more I find myself using it. It’s a weird and expensive strategy, but it’s working for me. Here’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well!

It’s really great at showcasing stats about what you read, rather than the updates-sharing focus of GR, and it has really nice monthly summaries!” – Aurora “Reading about Adi’s suffering with LibraryThing, I remembered that just a few days ago, I started using Hardcover, and so far, I’m finding it really cool.” – AH “Taskly is a very straightforward list app for iOS with absolutely nothing else. I have been looking for something to manage my grocery list or just things I need to buy. Twodos is another such app, except it has a very clever way to separate the list into two categories: Sooner and Later. That’s something I really love about it.” – Karan “I just put about six hours into Wagotabi, and I’m wildly impressed. It is one of the most clever and effective Japanese learning games I’ve ever played. It’s structured like Pokémon, but instead of catching monsters, you’re learning Japanese words and grammar. Instead of battling, you’re engaging in social interactions that put your new skills to the test. Over time, it replaces more and more English text with Japanese. And it’s genuinely fun! Duolingo be damned; Wagotabi is the king.” – Tom “I grabbed a Steam Deck OLED a few weeks back and have been diving into games I just kind of missed. Uncharted 4 and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy were great. Now digging into the modern Tomb Raider trilogy. I guess I like adventure games when FIFA isn’t available.” – Andi “I upgrade phones every two to three years, and one way I keep it fresh is to get a new case every year. This year’s case upgrade was from Keyway Designs. They make gorgeous wood and metal phone cases (and other goodies). Check them out!” – Bill “Trying a new second brain app, Sublime, that adds a few interesting features. Will try for a few weeks and see how it grows on me.” – Miguel “I have a seriously good Switch controller for you: the GuliKit Zen Pro is awesome, supports everything the Pro Controller does, and has Hall effect sticks to boot. It’s also a lot cheaper than the Pro Controller, so I’d recommend it for anyone buying a new Switch, too!” – Ben “I’ve been using Capture for iOS, and it’s low-key amazing. Like should be a built-in feature-level amazing. Anything I come across online, I can set aside, hold it off to the side, and then send it where it needs to go later.” – Max “The premise of MovieCart is simple: it’s for watching full-length movies on an actual Atari 2600. The reality is quite complex. It’s the work of a mad genius, and you may feel like one, too, once you actually get a film running!” – Tom Approximately every single person on the internet has been talking about the Chicken Shop Date episode with Andrew Garfield, which really is as charming as you can imagine. (Garfield has a history of great YouTube moments, like his convo about grief with Stephen Colbert.) The episode sent me down the rabbit hole of all things Chicken Shop Date, and it turns out, host Amelia Dimoldenberg has been through a truly fascinating ride as a creator. Last year, she did a great interview with Colin and Samir, which doubles as a (very funny and silly) masterclass in how to turn a YouTube channel into a show at the very center of pop culture. All my favorite creator stories are equal parts ruthless execution and constant aimless experimentation, and Dimoldenberg is a perfect example of both.

            "content": "\nThis article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.\n      We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site.\n     In an exciting early Black Friday deal, the Garmin Fenix 7 is now available for just $448 down from its regular price of $649. This huge discount marks a record low that we haven’t even seen during Prime Day which makes it a unique opportunity for anyone in the market for a high-quality multisport GPS watch. Remember that the new Fenix 8 is priced between $999 and $1,099—essentially double the cost of a Fenix 7—yet the differences in features are minimal. See at Amazon The Garmin Fenix 7 is designed for outdoor enthusiasts and boasts a rugged and sophisticated design that includes a 1.3-inch always-on display and a battery life that can last up to 18 days in smartwatch mode, 57 hours in GPS mode and an impressive 40 days in Expedition mode. This longevity ensures that you can rely on the watch during long adventures without worrying about recharging. The Fenix 7 has an extensive range of built-in sports apps which allows you to track over 30 different sports. Whether you’re into running, cycling, golfing, swimming, skiing, or even surfing, this watch has you covered. The advanced performance metrics provide insights into your training status and real-time stamina tracking which can help you optimize your workouts and recovery times. For those who enjoy winter sports, the Fenix 7 includes specialized features for backcountry skiing and XC ski dynamics, making it an excellent companion for snowy adventures. For cyclists and mountain bikers, the watch offers MTB dynamics that track your performance on trails and provide metrics like jump count and distance. If you’re a fan of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), the Fenix 7 also supports HIIT workouts with customizable timers to help you stay on track during your sessions. The built-in ClimbPro feature assists climbers by providing real-time information on ascents and descents. In addition to its sporting capabilities, the Garmin Fenix 7 excels in health monitoring: it includes wrist-based heart rate tracking, Pulse Ox (which measures blood oxygen levels), stress tracking and enhanced sleep monitoring. This comprehensive health data allows users to maintain a holistic view of their fitness journey. Navigating the outdoors is made easy with built-in sensors such as a 3-axis compass, gyroscope, and barometric altimeter. The watch supports multi-GNSS satellite systems (GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo), ensuring accurate location tracking no matter where your adventures take you. Preloaded maps for thousands of golf courses and ski resorts worldwide add even more value to this already feature-rich device. With its combination of style and functionality, the Garmin Fenix 7 also offers smart notifications when paired with a compatible smartphone, music storage for your favorite tunes during workouts, and Garmin Pay for contactless payments in supported regions. The intuitive button controls work seamlessly with a responsive touchscreen interface for quick access to all features.

            "content": "OpenAI has announced a set of new search features for its popular chatbot ChatGPT, the likes of which seem intentionally designed to make the app more competitive with Google and other search engines. In a blog post published Thursday, OpenAI announced the new features, which will allow users to search for “timely” information. The answers generated by ChatGPT will come with links to “relevant web sources,” the company announced. Those links can be found by clicking a “Sources” button beneath the auto-generated answers, which will open a sidebar with the relevant webpages. A prototype of the search features, dubbed SearchGPT, went live in July. “ChatGPT can now search the web in a much better way than before. You can get fast, timely answers with links to relevant web sources, which you would have previously needed to go to a search engine for,” the company announced in its blog. “This blends the benefits of a natural language interface with the value of up-to-date sports scores, news, stock quotes, and more.” OpenAI also announced Friday that it had partnered with “news and data providers” to give users “up-to-date information and new visual designs for categories like weather, stocks, sports, news, and maps.” Organizations listed as partners in OpenAI’s work include the Associated Press, Axel Springer, Condé Nast, Dotdash Meredith, Financial Times, GEDI, Hearst, Le Monde, News Corp, Prisa (El País), Reuters, The Atlantic, Time, and Vox Media. Media partnerships with OpenAI have been controversial, given the potential market competition its products pose to news organizations. The New York Times is currently suing OpenAI for copyright infringement, and has accused the company of using its material illegally. OpenAI’s move here is amusing. The obvious implication is that its trying to make ChatGPT more like Google. However, Google has also been trying to make its search engine more like ChatGPT. Earlier this year, the tech giant rolled out AI-generated answers to Search queries as part of its pivot towards broader AI integration. The rollout was rocky (the answers were often wrong, and are still often wrong), but the AI commentaries have stuck around. OpenAI’s ChatGPT feature, coming a full five months after Google’s “Answers” feature, looks derivative, and doesn’t appear to offer anything that Google isn’t already offering. OpenAI claims the number of users for its app is going up, though it’s a hanging question whether web users will ever defect from Google in droves the way Sam Altman hopes. \nChatGPTGoogleOpenAI  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          You can say goodbye to the dreaded \"🥲 to 'why the hell aren’t emoji reacts working?’” from iOS to Android with RCS.\n         \n          OpenAI is going through a rough patch and it's Elon's turn to take revenge.\n         \n          A judge found that two media outlets alleging copyright violations hadn't demonstrated that they'd been harmed by OpenAI removing \"copyright management information\" from its training data.\n         \n          Google accidentally leaked its AI agent on the Chrome extension store but quickly removed it.

            "content": "Every day on the gambling site 1xbet, thousands of sports matches air that the degenerate gambler can lay odds on. There are games like hockey, soccer, and basketball but they don’t look quite right. Everything is broadcast from low-resolution cameras more at home in a horror movie than a sports organization and the games are modified to have fewer players and end quickly. A game of “short football,” a kind of miniaturized soccer, can end in 10 minutes. Some of the games involve players as young as 14. A joint investigation between Bellingcat and Josimar dove deep into the surreal, off-putting, and borderline illegal world of 1xbet. The site is a large gambling website with millions of daily viewers. It’s illegal to access the site in several countries, including the United States. One day in September, the online gambling website 1xbet live-streamed 1,297 games of “short football.” A match is around 10 minutes long and played on a small field between teams of three to five players. The report estimated that 1xbet may be airing half a million games every year. These games are not played for the love of the sport. It’s obvious from the footage that these games are about industrialized gambling. There is no cheering crowd or fancy camerawork, the players appear in converted warehouse spaces filmed from low-resolution cameras that call to mind the early cam-girl era. If there is a crowd of cheering fans, they come in the form of a sticker plastered on the wall of a small room where a game is played. People are betting on air hockey, cricket matches played between teams of two, table tennis, and games like bench soccer and table basketball. In bench soccer, two players sit opposite each other on benches and kick a ball back and forth trying to score goals on each other. Table basketball is like air hockey with a plastic ball played on a glowing arcade cabinet machine. Bellingcat was able to cross-reference some of the players with social media profiles and discovered the locations of many of the arenas. Some of the games are broadcast from Ukraine and Russia and involve 14 and 15-year-old teens. Josimar tracked down one of the adult players of short football who described a shady operation where he worked from 9 AM to 2 PM and was paid about $30 per day. 1xbet was founded by Dmitry Kazorin, Roman Semiokhin, and Sergey Karshkov. Russia issued an international arrest warrant against the three of them in 2020 for crimes related to organized crime and online gambling. The site is banned in multiple countries but continues to thrive and is estimated to rake in billions of dollars a year. The site also has big-time and legitimate sponsors. In July, Spanish football club FC Barcelona announced a partnership with 1xbet that will run until 2029. It also signed actress Urvashi Rautela as its brand ambassador to India, a country where it’s not legally allowed to operate. \nBettingfootballonline gamblingsoccer  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Initially, up to 28 iPhone 14 or iPhone 15 Pros will be used for the task.\n         \n          FIFA is coming down hard on Canada over the Olympic drone-spying scandal.\n         \n          \"Germany's worst period should not be printed on a jersey,\" the German historian Michael König said.\n         \n          Jeff Probst has planted 21 flags in the ground.

But that’s exactly what’s going on right now at Best Buy, where the $1,500 2024 LG 48″ Class B4 Series OLED 4K UHD Smart webOS TV is on sale for just $700. This crystal-clear TV is powered by the a8 AI Processor 4K, an artificial intelligence chip that detects what you’re watching or playing and automatically improves the image and sound quality. This 2024 addition is a huge upgrade even from LG’s powerful a5 Processor Gen 7, and makes the 48″ Class B4 Series TV an incredible buy at just $700. See at Best Buy The 48″ Class B4 Series TV is an incredibly immersive viewing and listening experience. Dolby Vision makes the color truly pop, and Dolby Atmos audio gives an amazing surround-sound effect for action, movies, sports, and gaming. The 48″ Class B4 Series TV also has Filmmaker Mode, which shuts off all the extra processing a TV might apply to movies and shows. This preserves the TV’s full contrast ratio, setting the correct aspect ratio, and maintaining the TV’s color and frame rates, so films look more like what you’d see in a theater. All of that processing power comes in handy when you use the LG 48″ Class B4 Series TV’s built-in WebOS, which includes all of the top streaming apps (subscriptions required) and also the 300+ free channels of content that come with LG Channels. If it seems like there’s a new feature or update to big-screen TVs every other day, just waiting to make your TV outdated almost as soon as it’s unboxed, you’re not wrong. But the 48″ Class B4 Series TV comes with LG’s WebOS Re:New program, which guarantees five years of software updates and feature refreshes that are automatically pushed out to your set. True, there will be no shortage of huge deals on big-screen TVs during the huge holiday shopping events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. But few will likely be able to compete with this one happening right now at Best Buy — the LG 48″ Class B4 Series TV is on sale for just $700, less than half of its usual $1,500 price. It’s a 2024 big-screen TV with every modern feature, and a five-year guarantee of free updates and upgrades that ensures it will remain a top-of-the-line viewing and listening experience.

            "content": "Marvel has finally revealed when Deadpool & Wolverine is coming to Disney+. However, because this promo is related to the pottymouth humor of the film, Marvel went about revealing its November 12 release date in the porcelain bowl of a urinal ordained with Wade and Logan decorated deodorizer blocks. Maximum effort, indeed. If you’re still scratching your head as to why Marvel would promo the film’s release date with literal toilet humor, apparently there’s a fourth-wall breaking method to their madness. According to the film’s press release, multiple sports arena bathroom stalls will have the yellow and red blocks inside their urinals. If you’re that kind of fan wondering where they can see a man about a masked horse, here’s the exact arenas and days these “sacred stalls” will be around: October 30, 2024 October 31, 2024 (Halloween) It seems like Marvel’s little Deadpool & Wolverine publicity stunt seems to just be placing soap bars in urinals and nothing more. Hopefully fans don’t go ape shit like when McDonald’s thought it was a novel idea to start selling Rick and Morty‘s szechuan sauce. Now that the high-brow toilet humor is done circling the drain however, a more palatable fourth wall breaking feature fans can look forward to with Deadpool and Wolverine‘s Disney+ release is a filmmaker commentary track. In it, fans can listen to audio commentary from director Shawn Levy and Ryan Reynolds. As mentioned above, Deadpool & Wolverine, staring Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, isn’t only a rated-R Marvel film, its actually the highest grossing rated R film of all time. A feat it accomplished by edging out the equally brutal and action-packed Keanu Reeves flick, John Wick: Chapter 4.

            "content": "Apple recently realized it could make its watch even smarter by adding sensors to the band and the dial. A recent report reveals that the Cupertino company was granted 38 patents on November 5, 2024, by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for a “smart health and communications band for Apple Watch and a future headset.” The patent looks at a stretchable fabric item with an opening to fit around a certain body part. The band could include sensor circuitry for measuring various health data, such as “electrocardiogram measurements, blood pressure measurements, or respiration rate measurements.” The more interesting thing here is that the band doesn’t necessarily point toward being a wristband. It could be any wearable that sports elastic fabric, such as a “head band, a hat, an undergarment, a shirt, pants, shorts, yoga clothing or other athletic attire, an arm band, an elastic belt, a sock, a glove,” and so on. However, the patent is more focused on specifically the wristband and the headband. So, while it’s possible that we might see Apple releasing entirely new wearables embedding health sensors, the greater probability is that either the Apple Watch will get smarter or the Apple Vision Pro will receive additional health-tracking capabilities. The patent also includes additional uses for the smart band (via TechRadar). It claims that the circuitry along the fabric could be given the ability to recharge wirelessly and to “communicate wirelessly with external electronic equipment.” The latter points towards its ability to connect to other Apple devices (MacBook, iPhone, AirPods). We have seen how big Apple is regarding ecosystem integration, and it only makes sense that “external electronic equipment” would be its own offerings. This isn’t Apple’s first time filing patents for smart fabric. Around a month ago, it put in a request for a touch-sensitive smart textile, and before that, once in 2022 and 2019. If Apple’s plans come to fruition, time will tell how successful they are. Looking at how massively the Apple Vision Pro failed, it’s apparent why Apple is trying to revive it. I wonder how the new health features will affect its price, considering it’s already exorbitantly priced. As for the Apple Watch, considering that it’s already one of the company’s successful offerings, I wonder if stuffing additional sensors would come off as an overkill. The recent stuffing of AI in every other product released this year has shown us that too much of something isn’t always appreciated. \nAppleApple Vision ProApple Watch  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The visionOS 2.2 developer beta for the Apple Vision Pro finally added ultra-wide Mac mirroring, and it's the most exorbitant, premium way of using a MacBook.\n         \n          The iOS 18.2 beta has a ton of awesome features you can try right now, like the Image Playground app and upgraded writing tools.\n         \n          The ‘Zero’ AR glasses run web apps and includes self-made lenses.

            "content": "If you are a gamer who hops between Xbox and Nintendo Switch, GameSir’s new Tarantula Pro might be exactly what you’re looking for. The $69 controller allows you to customize its ABXY button labels and functions, so you can personalize the controller according to the platform you’re playing on. It is designed to work with the Nintendo Switch, Xbox, mobile (Android and iOS), PC and Mac, and the Steam Deck. My fascination with this controller stems from the fact that while many gaming companies now offer workarounds for connectivity for each console, there are not enough solutions for the muscle memory you’ve developed from each button layout on each console’s controller. This rings even more true if you consistently switch from Xbox and PC to Nintendo Switch. The Tarantula Pro uses a gear mechanism to change the face button layout from XABY, which is required for playing Nintendo Switch, to a YBAX orientation for playing Xbox and PC games. The transformation is done by simply long-pressing one of the buttons. The press corresponds to a rotation on the mechanical wheel, where the buttons are placed, and they immediately switch places. There’s an RGB lighting strip, a dedicated ring for the home button, and separate lighting for the ABXY buttons. The controller sports nine mappable buttons, including two quick-latch retractable back buttons, an NFC function, and a built-in six-axis gyroscope. This controller is powered by a 1200mAh battery. Another feature GameSir boasts on its latest controller is its proprietary Mag-Res TMR Sticks instead of Hall Effect joysticks offered on other gaming controllers. The company claims high precision, ultra-durability, and longevity on these sticks. Apparently, they can hit a 1000Hz polling rate and a 4096 sampling resolution. We often see gaming headsets with features that enhance seamless switching between consoles, PCs, and mobile. Cross-platform compatibility is something all gaming hardware companies work towards and proudly tout on their products. However, this mostly means its products are limited to offering multiple connectivity modes (Bluetooth, 2.4GHz dongle, and wired Type-C) that can facilitate a variety of gaming consoles or featuring physical base stations that can act as intermediaries between various inputs and outputs. Logitech’s G Astro A50 X is a good example of a gaming headset that does this by allowing “one-click switching” between all your gaming consoles and PC/Mac. I also recently checked out Razer’s latest Kraken V4 Pro, which comes with an OLED gaming hub for smooth cable management and I/O, among other useful functions. The Tarantula Pro is available to preorder now on the website for $69. If you opt for the bundle with a transparent charging stand included, it’ll cost $79. \nNintendo SwitchXbox  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          While the Switch 2 may be backwards compatible, Nintendo would not confirm whether we'll still be able to use our old cartridges.\n         \n          Hardware hackers prove they can make the Nintendo Alarmo play whatever they want on screen without ripping out its guts.\n         \n          The handmade Xbox handheld includes the console’s original motherboard, and soon it may even connect to Xbox Live.\n         \n          It also features an upgraded mic with auto-mute and voice isolation.\n         \n          You can grab a 1TB Xbox without a disc drive for a slight discount, but even with redesigned internals there’s not much to entice new buyers.\n         \n          Xbox is currently one of the few companies that doesn't let you buy games on its app, but the recent Epic v.

The New York City Marathon is this Sunday. Racers from around the globe will be hitting foot to pavement across all five boroughs of the greatest city on Earth. Maybe you are one, know one, or strive to be one some day. Whether you’re gearing up for these 26.2 miles in a few days or just one or two in the morning before work, you need yourself a good running watch. Amazon has the Garmin Epix for 44% off right now. That’s a $400 discount, bringing the price down to just $500 for a limited time. See at Amazon This second generation smartwatch is built for athletic lifestyles. The large 1.3-inch AMOLED display is always on, so you can see it clearly whether in total darkness or with the high noon sun reflecting right off of it. Each watch is made with a sapphire display with a titanium bezel to withstand getting tossed and banged around on occasion. As any good smartwatch does, the Garmin Epix has built-in GPS. While GPS is on, battery life can las up to 30 hours when in always-on mode. if you set it to gesture mode, as in the display only turns on when you position your wrist to look at it, the watch will last up to 42 hours. When not using GPS, the battery can last up to five days in always-on mode or a staggering sixteen days in gesture-mode. This puts smartwatches like the Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch to shame, which need to charge every day or two. While the watch of course has all sorts of performance metrics and features to gain better insight into your long runs and workouts on the track, the Garmin Epix is built for all kinds of sports. You can even take it to the slopes to view preloaded SkyView maps for over 2,000 ski resorts worldwide.

            "content": "Around 66 million years ago, a massive asteroid stretching 6 miles (10 kilometers) across struck Earth, ending the reign of the dinosaurs. Today, the probability of an asteroid that size wiping out humanity is quite low, but there are thousands of smaller space rocks lurking around Earth’s orbit capable of destroying entire cities, and those have a higher chance of crashing into our planet. The problem is, we don’t really have a viable plan of defense. In September 2022, a NASA spacecraft crashed into a city-killer-sized asteroid to slightly nudge it off its orbital course and test kinetic impact as a means of planetary defense should an asteroid be headed our way. NASA’s DART mission (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) was a success, proving that we may stand a chance against the flying piles of rubble. In his new book, How to Kill An Asteroid, award-winning science journalist Robin Andrews offers a rare personal look at the development of the mission, the team that made it happen, and what it was like to be inside the mission control room when the asteroid got smacked. The book leans into the sci-fi fantasy aspect of the mission, detailing all the cool science while still delivering drama, humor, and a great group of characters. Gizmodo: What got you interested in the DART mission? Robin Andrews: I’m a volcanologist by training. So, I love writing about volcanoes, earthquakes, or anything that’s sort of dramatic, Earth-shifting stuff that makes you feel small—stuff that really kind of affects us in a more literal way. There’s nothing really more literal than something in the solar system coming to crash into us. I covered DART’s launch, and I was surprised that more people, even within NASA, weren’t making a bigger deal with it, because it felt so pop culture. I grew up watching Armageddon and Deep Impact as a nerdy kid, and I knew a lot of it was a bit silly, but like, the idea of asteroids and things crashing into the planet felt so real. It’s a real danger, but it felt really weird that NASA wasn’t making a much bigger deal out of it. It just struck me as weird that that kind of subject of planetary defense hadn’t been covered that much, so I’d felt really stupid if I didn’t pitch it. Gizmodo: Did you plan on writing a book about the DART mission from the start? Andrews: It was through covering it. I think the thing that really fascinated me in particular is that most spacecraft NASA and others build, they want to live for as long as possible. They have this eight minutes of terror on Mars when [the rovers] land and there are obituaries for spacecraft that die. But the point of this spacecraft was to die; if it missed and it kept living, then they had messed up. So there was this weird inversion of what people expect and it just felt very dramatic. Gizmodo: There’s so much humor in your book. Did that just come naturally? Andrews: Sometimes when you speak to scientists for long enough, they sort of get more comfortable and I just got the sense that most of them are quite goofy. I think I really connect with people like that anyway, and it doesn’t matter who they are, whether they’re a journalist or a scientist. If they don’t take themselves that seriously, I think I always get on with them. So it felt a lot easier to slip into the goofiness once you saw a sign of it. Gizmodo: How did this real-life NASA mission compare to some of the movies that portray asteroid collisions? Andrews: It was super surreal, and it felt more sci-fi to some extent rather than just straight science. I love science, obviously—I’m a big massive geek. But it struck me how the science in the mission was relatively straightforward to just allow them to do something relatively simple, as in punch an asteroid. Gizmodo: What was it like to be inside mission control during that time? Andrews: It was amazing. Honestly, I had a feeling we’d hit it, but having spoken to them throughout and finding out that, actually, there were points behind the scenes where they were not as confident as the official statements were portraying, there were malfunctions on the spacecraft and things like that. No matter how sure someone says that they’re gonna do something, if someone’s never done this before, you think anything could happen at this point. And it was properly exhilarating. I’m not massively into sports, but the buzz in that room was better than any sports game anyone has invited me to. There was so much riding on this one thing, and all the engineers looked so pale, white, nervous. You couldn’t make it up how dramatic it was—they only had one shot to do this. You’re meant to be objective to these things but you couldn’t help but get wrapped up in it a bit. I’ve never seen people jumping up and down and screaming so much. Gizmodo: What were the most challenging parts of the mission? Andrews: I think just getting the mission off the ground. It’s amazing that they even managed to fund this mission. It might be like the space debris problem; you just imagine that an astronaut is gonna get killed by a bit of flying debris or a piece of a rocket is gonna land on someone’s house, and maybe then someone will do something. It struck me as very strange that planetary defense was considered the same as planetary science for quite a long time. I can’t remember who said it, but someone was like, “Oh, planetary science is great but it’s pointless if we’re all dead.” Gizmodo: And you’re not just talking about asteroids that would wipe out the entire planet, but smaller asteroids that can still cause significant damage? Andrews: Yeah, I think that was another thing that made me really want to write this book. There’s so much written, fiction and non-fiction, about the planet killers, but these city killers—they come out of nowhere and cause damage to a random spot on Earth. As someone who wrote about volcanoes for so long, you can never stop those from erupting but you can just knock [asteroids] away. Gizmodo: Who do you hope reads this book? Andrews: There’s a time for popular science to really get into the nitty gritty of the science and those books are great as well. But I have this feeling that there are a lot of popular science books that end with a message of, “well, we’re all screwed, I guess,” which I understand. It’s important to underscore that.

            "content": "We weren’t totally thrilled with Apple’s 2023 iMac refresh that came stock with the company’s newfangled M3 silicon. Still, the Cupertino, California tech giant is ready to get into the ring again with a similar-looking, though more powerful, 24-inch iMac, this time with the M4 chip housed inside. Beyond that, all the Apple Magic accessories are getting an upgrade. Before you get too excited, the only change is the switch from Lightning to USB-C. See at Best Buy If you stack the two all-in-one computers side by side, you’d be hard-pressed to spot the difference. However, the major improvement this time is the switch to M4. That chip made its debut with the iPad Pro earlier this year. It’s a more powerful processor than last year’s M3, though it won’t be as much of a dramatic jump as moving from the M1 or M2 chips to the M4. The M4 has a much better neural engine than the previous version of Apple silicon, plus the expanding ray-tracing capabilities born by the M3. Apple claims the new $1,300 iMac with the new chip is around 1.7 times faster than the iMac with the M1 chip in CPU performance and more than two times better in GPU performance. However, the base model only nets you the 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU. As for gaming, you may be limited by a lack of options for an M4 Pro chip, even though you can grab the 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU version for $1,500. The new iMac does not offer an M4 Pro option, though several configurations with more GPU cores and SSD storage are available. Like the 2023, Apple’s latest all-in-one computer sports a 4.5K Retina LCD. The 2023 version offered options ranging from 256 GB of SSD memory and 8 GB of RAM to 2 TB of storage and 24 GB of unified memory. There’s good news on this front, at least. This new version of Apple’s all-in-one comes with 16 GB of RAM across the first three models. There’s a version with 24 GB of memory and 512 GB of storage for $1,900. You can go up to 32 GB of RAM for an extra $200 and a 2 TB SSD for an additional $600. Last year’s iMac sported a wide range of pleasingly subdued colors, including a violet purple and a late autumn orange. The new version sports the same selection of blue, purple, pink, orange, yellow, green, and silver. Despite users having the option to taste the rainbow, you may want to spend more money on the step up from the base $1,300 model. The lower-end iMac only has two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports while the ones starting at $1,500 come with four. The more expensive iMacs also have an ethernet port, where the cheaper one doesn’t. Just like last year, the iMac’s peripherals are meant to match your color selection. The all-new Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad are essentially the same product as before, but now they come with USB-C. That means you can charge them through one of the four USB-C ports on the rear of the new iMac with any spare cable you have lying around. Apple is releasing new Mac products this week in anticipation of its big blowout AI features dropping piecemeal over the next few months and into 2025. Apple launched macOS 15.1 on Monday, sporting the all-new Writing Tools, which uses AI to proofread, summarize, or rewrite text. The next step in its expanding AI-ified OS is ChatGPT, which is directly integrated with Siri and AI image generation with Image Playground. The new iMac starts at $1,300 and is available for preorder beginning Monday. It will ship on Nov. 8. See at Best Buy Apple said it plans to pull the sheet off even more Mac products this week, so keep your eye out for even more new desktops and laptops. \nAppleiMac  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The visionOS 2.2 developer beta for the Apple Vision Pro finally added ultra-wide Mac mirroring, and it's the most exorbitant, premium way of using a MacBook.\n         \n          The iOS 18.2 beta has a ton of awesome features you can try right now, like the Image Playground app and upgraded writing tools.\n         \n          The ‘Zero’ AR glasses run web apps and includes self-made lenses.

            "content": "Microsoft still can’t figure out whether or not to make an Xbox handheld. Sure, it’s never made a real attempt, but if the Redmond tech giant wants inspiration, it should look no further than this DIYer who crafted his own beautiful handheld based on the original Xbox from the halcyon days of 2001. The Xbox Steam Deck-like uses the console’s actual motherboard and will play any of the games that came out over its eight-year lifespan. Before you ask, the creator is working on adding WiFi connectivity so it can return to Halo 2 multiplayer over a revitalized version of Xbox Live. The handheld Xbox is a big, black brick machine, but it takes so many design cues from the original console that it could have come straight from the drawing board of Seamus Blackley and the other Xbox creators. The console’s creator, who goes by Redherring32 online, said the handheld sports a large 9-inch 480p display. The project required him to trim an original Xbox motherboard down to size, which took him four whole months to do. Now, he’s providing a guide for anybody who wants to do the same. Over Discord, Redherring32 told Gizmodo he’s been mostly using it to play Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 2. It’s taken a lot of effort to get here, and he said, “The thought of playing Halo: CE portably is one of the things that kept me going on this project.” The developer first became interested in the “portablizing” scene after he watched YouTuber Shank Mods’ 2018 video, where he ported a Wii into an Altoids tin. The Nintendo Wii has proved surprisingly scalable, but the Xbox hasn’t received the same treatment. Redherring decided to start on the project last year for the 2023 BitBuilt Summer Building Competition, and he’s reentered the project again for this year. The finalists for the indie developer competition won’t be revealed until Nov. 8. Looking at the project now, I feel nostalgic for those odd black-and-white buttons on the original Xbox controller. The designer told me the shell is an original design 3D-printed from industrial-level plastic. Redherring provided the files if you wish to print one yourself. Inside, the pared-down motherboard is combined with 12 custom PCBs for all the various controls and components. The project is fully open source, and you can download all the files for your own handheld on the creator’s GitHub. Of course, the size will limit its functionality. The device usually gets about 1.5 hours of playtime, though it supports up to 100W of USB-C charging. It doesn’t include a disc drive, but Redherring said he can load games onto its internal 128 GB microSD card. The designer added that he plans to build a CompactFlash for storage and—eventually—an M.2 SATA SSD. Redherring speculated he could use the USB-C port to attach a separate controller for local multiplayer, but you’d probably end up shouldering your friend for space on the 9-inch screen. The WiFi connection is another tricky task requiring an extra PCB, but the handheld can connect to Xbox Live with that installed. Well, it won’t connect to the original version that went offline in 2010. There’s Insignia, a project founded by a group of original Xbox fans that brings back the Live servers alongside some external leaderboards. If anything, the Xbox Live connectivity and the promise of returning to Halo 2 console multiplayer would put me over the edge. Yes, I can get my fix with Halo: The Master Chief Collection, but for purity’s sake, there’s nothing like going back to the original. I wonder if anybody still plays ad-hoc Zombies based solely on the honor system. \nXboxXbox Live  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          It also features an upgraded mic with auto-mute and voice isolation.\n         \n          You can grab a 1TB Xbox without a disc drive for a slight discount, but even with redesigned internals there’s not much to entice new buyers.\n         \n          Xbox is currently one of the few companies that doesn't let you buy games on its app, but the recent Epic v.

This is a weekend known through ages as being a time everyone rushed out or logged in to purchase a new TV, hoping to find some big savings on the latest and greatest display for your living rooms. However, you don’t need to wait for that weekend to find a great deal on an amazing new television. Amazon has a number of deals right now on LG smart TVs with a tremendous limited time offer on the 65-inch Class OLED evo C4 Series Smart TV. Normally, this 2024 OLED is priced at $2,700, but at the moment it’s going for a staggering 48% off — bringing the price down to just $1,394. See at Amazon Lots of TV manufacturers like to pack their products with all sorts of features that try to artificially boost the depth of color or increase the frame rate of the media you’re watching with software that nobody asked for. Now these can sometimes be helpful in certain scenarios. For instance, they tend to be pretty decent with sports. You might have an easier time watching the hockey game and following the tiny puck zip around your screen if the content has been upscaled and motion smoothed. But if you are watching a movie or premium network show, in many cases the director of photography and the editor worked hard to choose the right colors, the right, aspect ratio, the right everything to fit the mood and tone of what you’re viewing. That’s what’s wonderful about the LG OLEDs. The evo C4 Series has what’s called Filmmaker Mode and when you turn that on, it turns all that other crap off — so you can watch what you watch the way the director intended. Combine that with the support for both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos sound and what you get is the closest thing to the theatrical experience you possibly can in your own living room. For gaming, the LG evo C4 smart TV makes use of four HDMI 2.1 inputs. This allows for a frame rate of up to 120 fps when playing games on the Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, or a connected gaming PC. This OLED supports Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync, and VRR which prevents screen tearing while maintaining the high 144Hz refresh rate and response times of 0.1ms. The LG evo C4 supports a Game Optimizer setting which like Filmmaker Mode does for films, will change all the minute settings on the TV to give you the best performance you can get while playing video games. Get the 65-inch LG OLED evo C4 series smart TV for this limited time low price of just $1,394 — a nearly 50% discount — over at Amazon.

The newest model of the Samsung HW-Q600C 3.1.2 channel soundbar is just $249 — a 58% drop from its usual $598. This great deal gets even better if you own other Samsung products, like one of their big-screen TVs, or one of their mobile devices with Android 8.1 or higher. With Samsung’s Q-Symphony feature, the HW-Q600C pairs with select Samsung TVs to operate as one unit. And select Samsung mobile devices can send their audio to the HW-Q600C via Tap Sound by simply tapping the phone against the soundbar. See at Amazon The Samsung HW-Q600C’s Game Mode creates a truly immersive gaming experience, including precise sound positioning that’s a huge plus for competitive gaming, action games, or first-person shooters like Fortnite and Helldivers 2. And you can be sure those sounds are spot-on, thanks to Samsung’s HDMI eARC connection, which ensures lag-free delivery of sound from an eARC-compatible TV to your soundbar. All of this great audio comes from the HW-Q600C’s 3.1.2 channels of Dolby Atmos sound, which creates a 3D sound experience with only one front speaker. But if you want to really enhance the full surround-sound performance, the Samsung HW-Q600C is easily expandable — it will wirelessly connect to other Samsung speakers. The 40.6-inch-wide Samsung HW-Q600C is a minuscule 2.2 inches tall and 4.1 deep, weighing just 8.3 pounds. With its sleek, minimalist design and black color, it fits in any room beautifully, from a family room to a gaming room or the basement sports cave. It’s perfect for resting on a mantel, or it can be wall-mounted. Access to a power source and proximity to your TV’s HDMI port is all it needs. The wireless subwoofer is also pleasingly low-profile at just 13.5 x 11.6 x 7.2 inches. If you have a compatible Samsung TV, the HW-Q600C’s included remote control will drive both the soundbar and the TV, eliminating the need to juggle two remotes or hunt for a universal remote that needs to be programmed in order to control both devices. There are going to be home-theater deals flying fast and furious over the next two days of the Amazon Prime Big Deal Days event, but this 36% off deal on the Samsung HW-Q600C 3.1.2-channel soundbar might just be the one that ends your quest for reasonably priced, high-performing surround sound delivered in a compact package that doesn’t take up a ton of space.

            "content": "Some people get a lot of things from their parents. Their eye color, or the shape of their nose, or a crushing, inexplicable loyalty to a terrible sports team, which must be genetic, because why would anyone choose this agony? (Even with the heartache, Go, Habs, Go!) We also inherit some far less obvious attributes, including genetic coding that makes everything else we do possible. Within each of our cells—indeed, the cells of most organisms that have DNA—is a structure called mitochondria, which produces a substance called adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a vital component of the energy we need to stay alive. These tiny cell batteries have their own form of DNA, which is different from that found in cells’ nuclei. In nearly all animals, including humans, that mtDNA is inherited only from mothers. Why that’s the case has puzzled biologists, but new data could provide an answer, and lead to new treatments for some rare disorders. While there are cases of humans having mtDNA from both parents, it’s extremely rare. In 2016, Ding Xue, a professor of molecular and developmental microbiology at the University of Colorado Boulder set out to find out why that is. He discovered a complicated process that causes paternal mitochondrial DNA to essentially destroy itself. “It could be humiliating for a guy to hear, but it’s true,” Xue said in a statement. “Our stuff is so undesirable that evolution has designed multiple mechanisms to make sure it is cleared during reproduction.” In the intervening years, Xue set out to learn what happens in the rare cases where that self-destruct sequence isn’t initiated, and paternal mitochondria is passed down to offspring. He chose to experiment on C. elegans, a tiny roundworm consisting of only around 1,000 cells, but still has some tissues in common with humans, such as a nervous system, gut, and muscles. Scar-Free Healing? A Parasitic Worm Could Be the Key Describing the experiment in the journal Science Advances, Xue said the worms didn’t display any defects when it came to their sensory responses, but were affected in other ways, such as showing a reduced ability to remember or learn from negative stimuli. The altered worms were also less active in their movements. None of this is particularly surprising. Around one in 5,000 humans are affected by a mitochondrial disease, and the symptoms can often include developmental delays, impaired cognition, muscle weakness, and poor growth. Previous experiments revealed that when mice were altered to have two different mtDNA sequences, there were a number of negative effects on their metabolism, activity level, and cognition. What was surprising was that Xue and his colleagues were able to significantly reverse the effects, including returning ATP levels to normal. When they treated the worms with a form of vitamin K2, they found the worms’ learning and memory performance “significantly improved.” Xue’s paper not only explained the benefits of inheriting mitochondria from a single parent—since adding a second parent’s mitochondrial DNA can lead to adverse effects—but also may have laid the groundwork for future treatments of mitochondrial disorders. He said it’s possible that delays in eliminating paternal mtDNA could be what leads to the disorders occurring in humans. “If you have a problem with ATP it can impact every stage of the human life cycle,” he said. Roundworms are simple creatures, and it’s unlikely that simply giving humans with mitochondrial disorders vitamin K2 will fully cure their conditions. But the disorders can be hereditary, and Xue said that, while much more research needs to be done, it’s possible that giving vitamin K2 to mothers with a family history of the disease could lessen the chances of passing them on to their kids. There’s still no hope for a cure for the annual disappointment of missing the playoffs.

What’s more, these deals are now accessible to everyone, including non-Prime members, which makes it an ideal time for everyone to take advantage of significant savings. See all deals at Amazon US See all deals at Amazon UK Top deals for Tuesday: See all deals at Amazon Despite the official end of Prime Day (Oct. 8-9), Amazon keeps on offering massive discounts across a wide range of products. You’ll be pleased to find that popular Apple items are still available at reduced prices: the AirPods Pro 2 remain priced at $199 ($50 reduction from their original $249 price tag). Similarly, the 9th generation iPad is still 32% off and a 4-pack of AirTags can still be snagged for $79. Amazon’s own lineup of devices continues to see price cuts. Echo speakers and Ring security cameras are still available with discounts ranging from 40% to 70%. This extended sale period also encompasses a variety of other product categories, including audio equipment from premium brands like Sony and Bose. Home appliances and gaming consoles such as the PS5 Standard and Digital Edition remain part of the deal roster. Additionally, a range of beauty products and toys are still available at discounted rates on this Tuesday, one week after Prime Day. See all deals at Amazon Lego enthusiasts have not been left out of this extended promotional period of Prime Day: the Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar continues to be available at a 20% discount (top seller on the platform) which makes it an attractive option for those looking to add a touch of galactic fun to their holiday countdown. The Lego Harry Potter Castle is now priced at $135 down from its original $169 and it is also very popular. While Amazon extends its promotional period, other retailers are not sitting idle. Samsung is offering significant discounts on its latest technology through its official store. This includes special deals and trade-in offers on new Galaxy S24 smartphones and the Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 foldable models, with potential savings exceeding $1,000 for trade-ins. As this extension of Prime Day deals continues, stock levels for very popular items are becoming a concern. High-demand products like the MacBook Pro, AirPods Max and certain headphone models from Beats and Bose have already sold out. You should act quickly as some more might run out of stock by the end of the day. In a departure from the typical Prime Day format, these extended deals are now accessible to all shoppers regardless of Prime membership status. This democratization of discounts provides an good opportunity for non-Prime members to enjoy savings reserved for subscribers. While this extended Prime Day sale period offers substantial savings, Black Friday is on the horizon. Savvy shoppers might consider this an opportunity to get a head start on holiday shopping and potentially avoid the rush and stock issues often associated with Black Friday sales.

            "content": "Focal is an exclusively luxury audiophile brand that’s been producing extravagantly priced monitors since its inception, so the whopping $40,000 price tag on its latest release, the Diva Utopia, shouldn’t push you out of your seat. This is the audio company’s first-ever wireless, connected loudspeaker, and it’s only available at select Focal stores starting this month. I attended a briefing and listening party (of sorts) of the Diva Utopia on Tuesday night at a private event in New York. I was blown away by its brilliant sound quality and extremely elegant design. I left feeling like I had gone to an ear spa. It was a much-needed treat for my ears after being subjected to overwhelming Manhattan noise all day. The Diva Utopia is a three-way bass reflex floor-standing speaker. It uses three speakers—bass, midrange, and treble—instead of just the bass and treble speakers found on many similar loudspeakers. The bass reflex bit refers to that vent you usually see on the bottom of a floor-standing loudspeaker. It helps dispel air outside, assisting with a better-sounding low-end. The standout feature of the Diva Utopia is its UWB (Ultra Wideband) tech. UWB allows a wireless connection between the pair’s left and right speakers, so no cables are running between your setup. Before the listening demo, we assumed that the speaker was yet to be connected to an external amp, but we were pleasantly surprised upon learning that it comes equipped with a built-in speaker, DAC, and amp. All that this monstrosity needs is a simple connection to an AC outlet, which is hard to tell by just looking at it. I’ve heard speakers with UWB often can’t tolerate someone standing between them, which results in distortion. The briefing was fairly chaotic, with media and PR circling the speakers every now and then, but they didn’t experience a single signal drop. Focal says this is possible via an Intelligent Dynamics Clocking tech that ensures the internal components of the speakers always work in perfect sync. We all took turns playing our favorite songs on the Utopia via Bluetooth on Tidal. I played Kahani Suno by the Leo Twins and Mr. Sandman by Oppidan, and I felt sad at the thought of these songs never sounding the same again. The low-level detail was intricate enough for me to even make out the decay of an instrument’s reverberation that follows right after it’s played. The treble produced by the M-shaped Beryllium inverted dome tweeter was sharp and crisp and retained its strength even at the highest frequencies in Kahani Suno. The bass on the four 6.5-inch W-shaped woofers was enough to send vibrations throughout the event space with its punchy thump. Every instrument was reproduced with unbelievable accuracy and precision, resulting in a wide, spacious, crystal-clear soundstage. Despite the heavy bass, the vocals reproduced on the 6.5-inch W-shaped midrange driver were able to cut right through it. The Diva Utopia can be controlled by its dedicated remote, the Focal companion app for iOS and Android, or voice assistance via Google Assistant or Siri. Apart from Bluetooth, it supports AirPlay 2 and Google Cast. It connects to a TV via a regular optical or HDMI eARC input and also supports turntables on an RCA line input. A connectivity feature that stood out to me was the inclusion of a hi-res cable in the box. The speaker supports your standard 24-bit/96kHz audio, but for even better, recording studio-worthy sound, it can go up to 24-bit/192kHz with the hi-res cable. The speaker looks as stunning as it sounds. It sports an extremely minimal and subtle look with just a backlit Focal logo at its bottom. The overall vibe is contemporary, with polyester fibers lining its walls, which the company claims also helps with insulation and improved sound. The Diva Utopia is now available for $40,000 a pair at select Focal stores.

            "content": "I know you’ve waited until the eleventh hour to do your Halloween shopping, so this list should come just in time. Whether you’re hosting a bash at a haunted mansion or squeezing your guests into a coffin-like studio apartment, the fright-making tech here will elevate your party. Several of these items will come in handy after Halloween is over, too, like the clip speakers and portable projector. But hey, who says an eyeball doorbell isn’t appropriate year-round? This 500-watt fog machine for $60 carries high potential to be the star of the show at your next party. It promises to send out bursts of fog that will slowly take over your home and convert it into a real haunted affair. The best feature is customizable, remote-controlled RGB lighting. There are 13 colors to choose from. AGPTEK’s fog machine is advertised as non-toxic and unscented. See AGPTEK Fog Machine at Amazon This $40 waffle maker is perfect for creating on-theme waffles or pancakes in minutes. It makes seven designs: pumpkin, ghost, haunted house, spider, bat, cat, and cauldron. It has a non-stick surface and weighs just a little more than 3 pounds. You can snag it in a black or white colorway. Honestly, you don’t even need to wait for Halloween for this one. See Waffle Maker at Amazon This is my favorite item on the list. I mean… look at it. Priced at $50, this doorbell features a bulging green eyeball. Spooky sound effects are icing on the creepy cake. See Eyeball Doorbell at Amazon This $36 LED mask is an absolute steal. It uses over 200 lamp beads that light up when you turn the mask on and change their appearance when you use a pre-determined gesture. There are 25 dynamic and 25 static patterns that the mask is capable of showcasing. Moyaka says the material used (plastic and sponge) and pre-cut eyeholes make it comfortable enough for long wear, and the head strap is adjustable for various head sizes. On a full charge, Moyaka’s LED mask should last eight to 10 hours. See Led Mask at Amazon This 300-light strip has embeeded motion sensors, which means it will automatically turn on as someone approaches, hopefully giving them a little scare. They spread out to a whopping 114 feet, so they should be good to cover a quite large outdoor area. They also sync with four spooky music tracks. See String Lights at Amazon These creepy eyeball lights are just $10 for two packs of six eyeballs. These are solar powered, so simply stick them in your garden and wait for your guests to scream in delight. Personally, I’d install these in my garden even outside of Halloween. Their subtle green glow makes them ideal for gently illuminating a driveway or walking path. See Solar Eyeball Lights at Amazon JBL’s recently launched $50 Go 4 and $80 Clip 5 speakers are ideal to play spooky soundtracks in the background at your Halloween house party. The best feature on these speakers is their Auracast compatibility. This means you can pair the two and have them work in unison to offer louder, more powerful sound. The setup takes less than a minute and is one of the most budget-friendly ways to access multi-directional stereo sound. Halloween parties can get messy, which is another reason these highly water- and dust-resistant speakers are a great choice. The Go 4 and the Clip 5 last about seven and 12 hours, respectively, which should be enough for a wild night. See JBL Go4 at Amazon See JBL Clip5 at Amazon This camera initially looked like a gimmicky toy to me, but taking it out for a beach day made me realize how much I underestimated it. This is one of the most hassle-free, no-BS instant cameras I have checked out. It retails for $150, which makes it roughly as much as other instant cameras on the market, such as the $200 Instax Fujifilm Mini 99. This Kodak camera creates impressively bright photos. Admittedly, it’s not the sharpest image quality, but the results carry excellent saturation and vibrance. A viewfinder lets you preview your photo before you print it. I know the plastic body can give off a flimsy vibe, but if you can get past its aesthetic, there’s a lot of utility on this thing. This $500 XGIMI projector is the perfect tech to handle your spooky movie binge-watching. The MoGo 3 Pro is the latest addition to the company’s popular MoGo lineup. What makes this one stand out is its dramatically reduced form factor. It’s been trimmed down to the size of a soda can and weighs about the same as a carton of milk. This should make it easily portable from room to room, if the need arises. There’s a dedicated “extra powerbase stand” that features a Type-C outlet for charging and also serves as a nice stand to place the projector on while it’s in use. XGIMI also gave its flagship projector Google TV capabilities. This means it’s good to run any streaming service of your choice straight out of the box; you don’t need to pair the MoGo 3 Pro with a set top box or a smart TV dongle. Its remote also sports dedicated buttons for select streaming apps, streamlining the process even more.

            "content": "It’s Prime Day deja vu. Once again, we’ve returned to the halls of Amazon’s warehouses for the online retail giant’s ultimate deal-a-thon. Now that we get Prime Day twice a year, we’re doubly inundated with awful deals for products we want and slashed prices for junk we certainly do not want. Here at Gizmodo, we like to remind consumers that you don’t necessarily need to shop on Amazon to get good deals. Hell, you don’t need to shop on Prime Day, either. Best Buy, Walmart, and other big box shops regularly put hot-ticket items on sale around the same time. Not to mention that Black Friday is on the horizon, and we suspect many of the products on sale now will have similar discounts at the tail end of November. As usual, we find companies inflating the prices of their products to make the deals seem more dramatic. While you may certainly find a few hundred dollars off that phone you’ve wanted all year, we’re here to remind you not to fall for any “exclusive”-seeming deals. Always check price-checking apps and sites like camelcamelcamel for recent pricing history. Remember, if that smartwatch went for cheaper in the past, it would likely hit the same price again. We have a separate guide for helping you spot a bad Amazon deal yourself, but if you need more advice for Prime Day shopping, you can find it here.  Amazon is chock full of personal health products. On the last prime day, we found an ice tub claiming it was going 90% off (even though, in reality, it was only $20 on sale). The LifePro Sauna Blanket advertises its “Prime Big Deal” is taking it from $200 to $150. What you get is a large sleeping bag with slots for your arms. It even comes with a large thermal wrap to cover your body for extra heating. It looks like a good option for those who ever wanted to feel like a steamed clam at the bottom of a pot. The $150 price is lower than where the product usually goes. Normal sales prices typically take it to around $170. And if that’s not enough, there’s even more. This “Personal Sauna” from the company Sunakie may be the most awkward way possible to sweat yourself into better health. The company claims it gets hot in just 10 minutes, and you can still look at your phone thanks to zip-open arm sleeves and a hole in the top for your head. The Mets are finally in the playoffs, and since it’s been a while for some fans, they may not be used to the feeling of chilly stadium seats going into late autumn. You could dress warmly for the weather or grab a heated massage stadium seat that warms your buns and makes you take over an inordinate amount of room on the bench. It supposedly folds up enough to take it around as a backpack, but it’s the most outlandish piece of bleacher tech you may be afraid to stand up to grab a beer. The seat is $88 now, down from a typical $110. The real question for any potential customers is whether your warm butt is so important you take over two or three seats on the bleachers. You should check if your local sports venue allows you to bring an outside seat warmer. I know many folks who took part in “Caging” their friend’s room with actor Nicolas Cage’s mug. I also have a lot of experience with “reversible” sequin pillows, and I can tell you straight up that this Nicolas Cage Sequin Pillow Cover certainly isn’t worth it for just $3 off its base $15 price. Those sequins often get stuck in the wrong position, meaning you have to manually fix them and potentially break the strings holding them in place. Plus, they’re just uncomfortable, not the least, because you’re literally sitting on Cage’s crazed eyes and shining white teeth. The last time I talked about Prime on Prime Day was in 2023. Since then, the drink company and the brand’s main face, controversial influencer Logan Paul, have been inundated with lawsuits for lagging sales and failing to pay vendors for the ingredients used in the drink. So, should you jump the gun for a 24-pack of Prime drinks for a mere $18? Not so fast. The product normally goes for just $23, making the savings a mere $5. It’s one thing to buy color-coordinating clothes for your family during the holidays; it’s another to get matching Halloween pajamas sporting a mass of skulls. Listen, if your family is truly the goth band you’ve always wanted, you probably don’t require matching leggings. The Transwarrior-brand electric compressed air duster claims its fan goes 300,000 RPM with a 300G wind pressure. If that’s true, then why, oh why, does the company’s main image advertising its product include somebody sticking the product directly at their face? You probably don’t need gale-force winds to blow the dust out of your case, and any compressed air can do the trick. This duster is selling for $60 with an outlandish 91% off a claimed $700 base price. Yes, as you can guess, that’s absolute bullshit. The blower normally sells for around $85. Amazon is advertising many kinds of console sticker covers for Prime Day, but one that caught my eye, unfortunately, was this Xbox Series S and Xbox One cover. It made me so uncomfortable that I debated censoring the image. It’s a whole $2 off the original price, advertising a “limited-time deal” that seems like the quickest way to ensure anybody visiting your home stops talking to you immediately. I get it. Some older folk still don’t understand that you don’t have to buy physical software keys for security software. However, Norton and its owner, Gen Digital, are still pushing the ridiculous notion that you can get an amazing deal for Norton 360 antivirus for $20. However, as you might expect, the company’s antivirus normally costs an average of $30, not $90. This means the deal may net you $10 off for a pre-paid year-long subscription. \nAmazonPrime Day  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          BioWare veteran Michael Gamble will serve as the series' executive producer.\n         \n          Hundreds of employees signed a letter criticizing Amazon's 'non-data-driven' reasoning for ending hybrid work.

            "content": "In its heyday, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 era produced many still-ongoing franchises, but few have endured quite as interestingly as Borderlands. Gearbox Software’s shooter-RPG series has been so definitive and so infamous for so long in ways that will never truly go away. At the same time, it’s always been itself: for better or worse, Borderlands has no interest in changing what it is, or at least not for very long. Gearbox and 2K released the first Borderlands on October 20, 2009 for the two consoles (and a week later on PC), and it almost wasn’t what it is now. While it always seemed destined to be “Halo meets Diablo” and center on four Vault Hunters looking for alien Vaults on the planet Pandora, its initial showing had a more brown and tan palette similar to Fallout or Mad Max. Its now classic cel-shaded art style was chosen when the developers decided it needed a more distinct visual hook, much to the dismay of the game’s original art director. But the new look did its job: in addition to making it distinct, it inspired the team to get more outlandish, such as nixing “boring” class abilities in favor of more magical, RPG-like powers. The end result is a shooter that felt like a breath of fresh air compared to others at the time. Back then, Borderlands came onto the scene with a lot of confidence and personality. From its still-iconic opening set to Cage the Elephant’s “Ain’t No Rest for the Wicked” to the flashy, witty title cards for key characters and bosses, it was clear the aim here was to have some good shoot-and-lootin’ fun. Audiences largely grooved with that; it sold two million copies within two months, and that number climbed over the years. It didn’t hurt that four well-sized DLC packs gave it a long tail and reason to come back, possibly with some newcomers joining in on the fun. In 2012, Borderlands 2 came out with more: more story, new classes with more ridiculous abilities, more location variety, and most importantly, more guns. There’s a lot of game in that game, even before its own DLC expansions added onto the pile. Acclaim for the new release was even higher than the first, and it wouldn’t be wrong to say it’s the most important (and possibly still the best) entry of the series. But that definitive status cuts both ways, particularly when it comes to the writing. Borderlands 2 is where the cast becomes especially… chatty, to put it charitably, and that doesn’t always go over well. The humor can be a lot and not for everyone. In going through some of the games in recent years, I found myself not really paying attention to the story. If there’s any series of games that’ll help you whittle down your podcast or YouTube essay queue, it’s this one. Do the Borderlands games deserve to be punched at so often? Proooooobably not; their sense of humor isn’t offensive so much as it just excessive, to the point tuning out the dialogue becomes second nature. Really, the only time people have fully grooved with the writing was the first Tales from the Borderlands, in part because TellTale decided to dial it back several notches. The shadow of that beloved, episodic narrative adventure looms over the larger franchise, and Gearbox eventually folded characters from the original Tales into Borderlands 3. But an expansive megafranchise this is not; Gearbox has been careful to keep Borderlands big, but not so big it could cause the studio’s downfall. The bad movie from this past summer may as well have not happened, and it’s easy to imagine it won’t affect the series long-term. Unlike other franchises from the PS3/360 era, Borderlands hasn’t had some kind of critically and commercially catastrophic low point. Everyone may have a specific entry they don’t like, but that hasn’t led to an installment that exists mainly to apologize for the previous game, as is the case with Mass Effect, Assassin’s Creed, or Halo. Gearbox was also ahead of the game in terms of preservation: the studio’s made a continuous effort to not just expand the franchise to other systems, but also make sure older entries and their DLC come to the current console generation to exist forever. Whether intentionally or by complete accident, this has grown into a future-proof, bulletproof franchise. The Vault Hunters and locations may change, but Borderlands has otherwise stuck to the same playbook during its 15-year run. It’s kind of remarkable that a major, non-sports triple-A franchise from a western studio not concern itself with reinventing the wheel with each new installment. As the start of the current looter shooter era, this is even more notable; it hasn’t gotten lost in itself like Destiny sometimes does, and attempted competitors to both have been hobbled by an inability to fully understand what makes either so important. Gearbox isn’t interested in making these games chase current trends like a seasonal post-launch model or battle pass, even with more recent entries like the 2022 spinoff Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands. Instead, players are incentivized to keep chasing loot and stats that are all right there in the game proper, just waiting to be found. If there’s a word that best fits Borderlands, it’s “reliable.” Across the three mainline games and two shooter spinoffs, it can just be a blast to play with friends and watch bandits and monsters explode or be lit on fire (or both) and bust out a variety of wacky abilities. It isn’t for everyone, and it’s more than aware of that; but it’s comfortable in its own skin and is perfectly fine being dunked on while its devout audience keeps coming back for more. And as someone who pops in and out of that demographic, I say: bring on Borderlands 4, which is currently slated for 2025. Want more io9 news?

            "content": "There are plenty of birds that are widely referenced in popular culture today, whether as a sports team name or as the origin for an ubiquitous turn of phrase—looking at you, ugly duckling. But few have the linguistic range of the cuckoo. The name can evoke both a delirious state of mind (going cuckoo) and a shameful romantic betrayal (being cuckolded). They’re also a type of clock, a symbol for the arrival of spring, a beloved breakfast cereal mascot, and the inspiration behind a recently released indie horror flick (a very solid one, in this reporter’s opinion). Cynthia Chris, a professor of media culture at the College of Staten Island, City University of New York, has long studied how people view animals like the cuckoo. And in her newest namesake book Cuckoo, out in paper this month, she details the extensive cultural and scientific history of the bird. Gizmodo spoke to Chris about why she decided to tackle the legacy of the cuckoo, the origins of cuckolding, and what the future might look like for everyone’s favorite feathery brood parasite. The following conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Ed Cara, Gizmodo: This is the second book you’ve written about a specific animal, following 2021’s Crab. What made you want to take a closer look at the cuckoo in particular? Chris: The two books came from very different starting points. I had been following Reaktion’s Animal series for a long time, and wanted very much to write for it. My scholarly work had long focused on the history of nature films and representations of human-animal interactions in film and TV, and I knew that Reaktion was putting out beautiful books by wonderful writers. But every time I thought of an animal I’d like to write about, I’d discover they had already published a volume on that creature. Horse? Done. Donkey? Done. Squid? Done. Then my partner and I traveled to Costa Rica, and we were staying in a remote location on the Osa Peninsula, on the Atlantic coast. The first evening, I was walking alone on the beach, and I suddenly felt that the ground below my feet was moving. I knelt, and realized I was surrounded by thousands of tiny hermit crabs that were scurrying from the surf to shelter on shore for the night. And I thought: what fascinating creatures! Who are they, what are their lives like? We were off the grid, with no wi-fi, but I made a note to get to see if the Animal series already included a crab book. It didn’t, so I contacted Jonathan Burt, the series editor and an important voice in animal studies, to pitch the idea. He asked me to submit a proposal, which was accepted, and Crab was published in 2021. “We’d be better off being curious about animal life than moralistic about it.” I had so much fun researching and writing that book that I immediately asked if Reaktion might be interested in another contribution from me. I hadn’t yet settled on “my next animal,” but the editor I had worked with made a couple of suggestions. One of them was Cuckoo. I was puzzled at first—while in the U.S. we have yellow-billed and black-billed cuckoos, they are not terribly common backyard birds, very elusive, and I’d never seen one, let alone the common cuckoo, which breeds in the UK and much of Europe, which was really the bird Reaktion was interested in. But I started learning about the cuckoo, and I couldn’t resist: a fascinating bird, and one that is a common character in myth, folktales, and superstitions. Gizmodo: In your opinion, just what is it about these birds that have made them so enduring and widely referenced across so many contexts, from cuckolds to cuckoo clocks, throughout the span of human culture? Chris: One of the cuckoo’s behaviors seems to be the source of their charm—and another seems to be the source of its dicier reputation. The common cuckoo migrates long distances each year, from wintering grounds in Central Africa, to breeding grounds in the UK and Europe (or from South and Southeast Asia to Russia and elsewhere in the north). The British Trust for Ornithology has an amazing Cuckoo Tracking Project, where you can follow the movements of a few tagged birds during their migration. Their arrival has long been heralded as a welcome sign of Spring. That sign is often an aural one, as the common cuckoo is really good at staying out of sight. But the two-note call of the male (“ku-ku”) is unmistakable, and in the breeding season, they call a lot. Given that their migration is so reliably timed each year, it’s no wonder that Bavarian clockmakers copied their call for their famous clocks—and it didn’t hurt that the two notes were far easier to recreate with mechanical bellows than the more complex calls of roosters, quail, or nightingales. “The common cuckoo population is still large, but it is on the decline, as are some of the songbirds that are its regular hosts. Climate change is making their migrations more difficult.” But there is another aspect of the cuckoo’s lifecycle that is a big part of cuckoo lore, and it’s one that humans have found disturbing. Common cuckoos are obligate brood parasites. After they mate—which entails only a brief encounter—the male goes on his way to seek his next mating opportunity, and the female lays an egg in another bird’s nest when it’s unguarded. That nest usually belongs to a much smaller bird, a warbler or pipit, for example, who happens to have eggs of a similar color to that of the cuckoo. The host birds will incubate the egg as if it were their own. The cuckoo egg typically hatches first, and the cuckoo hatchling will force unhatched eggs or newly hatched baby birds out of the nest. As the sole survivor, the cuckoo is in a great position to demand food to sate its enormous appetite. They grow quickly, and soon loom over their much smaller hosts, who continue to parent the cuckoo as if it were their own offspring. Eventually, of course, it leaves the nest and goes on to live its cuckoo life. But the hosts have lost a brood, and may not have an opportunity to reproduce again until next year. The word “cuckold” derives from “cuckoo,” and has been slung around by writers from Chaucer and Shakespeare to James Joyce to poke a bit of fun at men whose wives may be carrying another man’s child. And this trope—the mysterious pregnancy, or the sudden appearance of child of unknown parentage—has become the stuff of any number of horror stories, such as the 1957 novel The Midwich Cuckoos by John Wyndham, which was made into movies under the title Village of the Damned in 1960, and again in 1995, and then under its original title as a TV series a couple of years ago. Vivarium (2022) and Cuckoo (2024) also draw their inspiration from brood parasitism. Gizmodo: What are your own thoughts on the cuckoo’s horror-inspiring breeding strategy? Chris: Truth be told, the animal kingdom creates new life in many, many ways, and the cuckoo’s is just one of them, however uncomfortable it might make some people. It seems silly to me to judge a non-human animal’s reproductive strategies, and the disgust evoked by brood parasitism says more about us than it does about them. We’d be better off being curious about animal life than moralistic about it. The ‘Molecular Devils’ That Cause the Most Fatal Diseases Ever Known Gizmodo: How are the birds themselves doing? Are there any reasons to be worried about the future of the cuckoo, particularly the common cuckoo most well-known to us? Chris: It’s complicated. The BTO’s surveys indicate that the common cuckoo population is still large, but it is on the decline, as are some of the songbirds that are its regular hosts. Climate change is making their migrations more difficult—wildfires in Spain make it more difficult for them to rest and feed along the way; the Sahara Desert is expanding, which means that migrating birds have further to go over dry, sparse land with few spots for them to refuel. As for the larger cuckoo family, Cuculidae, which includes malkohas, couas, and coucals, there are certainly species listed as vulnerable or endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), largely due to habitat loss in Sri Lanka, the Dominican Republic, Vietnam, Laos, and elsewhere. Ten years ago, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service declared the Western Yellow-Billed Cuckoo threatened, and has taken steps to protect some of its habitat. These are all reminders of how much humans have degraded the environment in which all animals—non-human and human alike—depend on. Gizmodo: Is there anything else that you would want to tell prospective readers? Chris: I hope that readers who are curious about animals of all kinds will take a look at Cuckoo and the other books in Reaktion’s wonderful Animal series—there are over a hundred volumes in print! Cuckoo, published by Reaktion Books and distributed through The University of Chicago Press, is now available to buy as a e-book or in paper. \nBirdscuckoosCultureQ&As  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          In a paper published today, scientists argue that plenty of animals are regularly consuming and using alcohol, though many questions about the practice still remain.\n         \n          Power wires normally pose no threat to birds, but that can change if they start trying to find snacks in the wrong places.\n         \n          These bird species haven't been seen in over 10 years.

            "content": "It’s face-off time, and you know what that means. Two smartphones go in, and one comes out the victor with plenty of bragging rights. This time around, we’re looking at a pair of entry-level smartphones: the iPhone 16 and Google Pixel 9. The gateway to their respective premium flagship brethren, these devices can be lost in the chase for snazzy new features. That would be a mistake, however, as both phones are great in their own right. But only one can be the best. So, let’s meet our fighters. In one corner, you have the iPhone 16. Instead of rocking last year’s processor like the iPhone 15, Apple outfitted the iPhone 16 with its new A18 Bionic chip, which, according to Apple, is noticeably more powerful than its predecessor. The phone also gets two new buttons that have proven to be pretty useful. Plus, with the rollout of iOS 18, we’re getting our first taste of Apple Intelligence, which will surely be a game changer for Apple fans. In the opposite corner is the Pixel 9. With a gorgeous design that mimics the iPhone, the Pixel 9 is affordable and has a long battery life. Using the same Tensor G4 chip as its more expensive siblings, the Pixel 9 isn’t an outright powerhouse but gets the job done. The dual rear cameras have gotten a noticeable upgrade, allowing the smartphone to capture stunning images and video. And as we continue to explore AI’s possibilities, Google is at the forefront with the feature-rich Google Gemini. So, in a battle of standard smartphones, will it be the Pixel 9 or the iPhone 16? Let’s find out. Both the iPhone 16 and Pixel 9 start at $799 sans trade-ins. That’s downright affordable compared to their more premium brethren with their fancy foldable hinges and high-powered cameras. But let’s see what $800 buys you these days. For the iPhone 16, you get a smartphone with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of onboard storage. Doubling the storage will cost you $899, while the 512GB version tops at $1,099. There are only two versions of the Pixel 9 available. The $799 base model has a whopping 12GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, while the 256GB model raises the price to $899. Normally, this round would have gone to the Pixel simply because of the RAM. However, Apple takes this round since the iPhone 16 has three different models on tap. Let’s get one thing straight: both the Pixel 9 and the iPhone 16 are beautiful phones. The Pixel 9 sports an aluminum frame with a Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 rear panel and display. The smartphone comes in four colors: Peony, Wintergreen, Porcelain, and Obsidian. Like its larger siblings, the Pixel 9 has frosted strips along the sides. It looks eerily familiar to an iPhone. However, the sides are one of the biggest differences between the two phones. The Pixel 9 has the power button and volume rocker on the right side with a slot that looks like a microSD slot but is annoyingly only a speaker. There’s also a USB-C port and a nano-SIM slot. Meanwhile, the iPhone 16 has the power and camera buttons on the right, the configurable Action button, and volume control on the left. A pair of speakers on the phone’s bottom sandwich the USB-C charging port. For once, the iPhone is the more colorful option, offering five colors (Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, Black, and White. Like the Pixel, the iPhone 16 has an aluminum frame and siding with a glass rear panel. Instead of Gorilla Glass, Apple uses the latest version of Ceramic Shield, which the company says is four times stronger than glass in previous generations of iPhones. While the iPhone 16 (6 ounces, 5.8 x 2.8 x 0.31 inches) isn’t as small as the last iPhone SE (5.1 ounces, 5.5 x 2.7 x 0.29 inches), it’s not that far off. That will make folks with smaller hands or just like a smaller phone happy. But as a lover of big phones, I’m firmly in the Pixel 9 camp. At 7 ounces, it’s not much heavier than the iPhone 16. However, with its 6 x 2.8 x 0.3-inch dimensions, the Pixel 9 is taller and has more display real estate than its Apple competitor. As much as I love a big smartphone, I’m giving this round to the iPhone 16 as it offers more color choices. Nowadays, the only thing that can beat an iPhone is another iPhone. With the new A18 Bionic chip, Apple says the iPhone 16 is 30% faster than its predecessor. Considering that the iPhone 15 runs on the A16 Bionic chipset, which is two years old at this point, it’s an easy dunk. Although the base model of the A18 isn’t as powerful as the A18 Pro chip in the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, it still ranks as one of the strongest mobile CPUs available. That stated, I had a hard time taxing the iPhone 16. Even after launching a number of apps, including Adobe Photoshop Express, Facebook, Instagram, and Spotify, along with 30 Safari tabs, I didn’t see any slowdown. I got a bit of a stutter when I played Resident Evil 4 Remake, but it was just that – a stutter. Other than the initial launch, the game ran smoothly. Did it have a console or PC-level graphics? No, but the fact that the game runs at all is still a modern miracle in my book. Apple is not the only company that can make its own silicon, as Google has been making its Tensor processors for a while now. The Pixel 9’s Tensor G4 processor had no problems with my multitasking, allowing me to run the same apps I used on the iPhone plus 30 open Google Chrome tabs. Instead of Resident Evil 4 Remake, I used Alien: Isolation and got smooth gameplay. Again, the gameplay wasn’t as pretty as the PC or console versions, but it’s a testament to how far we’ve come in mobile technology. I ran several rounds of Geekbench 6 on both phones to get concrete performance numbers, and it was no contest. The iPhone 16 left the Pixel 9 in the dust on both the single and multi-thread tests, scoring 3,412 and 8,416 compared to 1,699 and 4,241. Without question, this round goes to the iPhone 16. But I’m curious how the winner would fare against the Galaxy S24, OnePlus 12, and more premium phones. Finally, iOS 18 is here, so I can get a little taste of what Apple Intelligence offers. Currently available as a public beta, you can take some of Apple Intelligence’s more intriguing features for a test drive, with the rest debuting later this year. Like most AI software, there’s a big focus on creating summaries and streamlining some of your more tedious tasks, such as shooting off a response to an email in a long multiperson string. A big Summarize button in my Mail app quickly reduced a 20-entry thread to three scannable paragraphs in less than four seconds. The generative AI also came in handy when taking notes, providing options to proofread my text. Apple Intelligence can also rewrite, summarize, or break your notes down into key points or create a list. It can even write for tone, including professional, concise, or friendly. But the features don’t just reside in email or note-taking apps. Notifications can now be summarized into easily scannable bites. And like Gemini, Apple Intelligence can record calls, create transcripts, and summarize everything. I jumped into the Photos app to take some of the AI features for a spin. The Natural Language Search worked like a charm, quickly pulling together pics of my puppies when I asked for “dogs playing.” I did a little on-the-fly photo editing with the Clean Up feature, highlighting a rather large camera from a shot of my boyfriend. Not only did the offending tech disappear, but Clean Up also did a great job filling in the grain of the wood in the newly empty space. I chatted with Siri while it looked up fancy spots for my birthday dinner. Despite fumbling my words, the digital assistant managed to pull up a list of French restaurants in a 20-mile radius. It’s a cool feature for those of us whose mouths sometimes move faster than our brains. And while Siri isn’t new, it’s still coming with new tricks, such as letting you continue to scroll or navigate around the phone while using Siri. If you don’t like talking to Siri, you can type your request using the new Siri keyboard. You know, for the inquiries that require a bit of discretion. However, since it’s still in beta, not every Apple AI feature is currently available, so we’re still waiting to create AI-generated images via Image Playground and Genmojis, Apple’s cutesy name-generative AI emojis. Google’s Gemini AI is one of the leading AI platforms to date and has a host of features that range from helpful to fun. And while Gemini can do a myriad of things, I think it shines the brightest when it comes to photography. The redesigned Magic Editor is an absolute force as it has features like Reimagine that lets you modify pictures by simply typing a phrase. Or you can augment your group shots with Add Me to ensure everyone is in the picture. Meanwhile, you have Zoom Enhance, which uses generative AI to fill in the gaps when you zoom in on pictures, so you always have crisp detail. Google also has some AI sauce for video, bringing the ability to upscale to 8K and reducing or enhancing audio as you see fit. If you’re not a shutterbug, I can introduce you to Gemini Advanced. Here, you have AI summary tools and a conversational digital assistant that can organize and summarize your screenshots with Pixel Screenshots. Google Keep can also create lists. And if you need to record and transcribe a call, Gemini and Apple Intelligence can get the job done. Right now, both AI solutions are free. But that won’t last for long, at least not with Google. The company wants consumers to pay $20/month to access some of Gemini’s deeper feature sets. No word yet on whether Apple plans to follow suit with a paid subscription model. For now, I’m going to give this round to Google as it has a fuller feature set to explore. However, Apple Intelligence looks like it will give Google and Microsoft a run for their money on the AI front. Neither the Pixel 9 nor the iPhone 16 have the fancy cameras of their more premium brethren. However, both smartphones can snap a pretty picture. Historically, iPhones have delivered stunning stills and video, and the iPhone 16 is no different. Just like its predecessor, the iPhone 16 has a dual camera setup. The main camera is a 48 megapixel with a ƒ/1.6 aperture and a 12 MP ultrawide ƒ/2.2 sensor. The phone also retained last-gen’s 10x zoom. Flip the phone over to its front camera, and you have a 12 MP ƒ/1.9 aperture. Now, onto the Pixel 9, which also has dual rear cameras. Last gen’s 50 MP wide ƒ/1.68 sensor returns, but the ultrawide camera has gotten a big boost, jumping from 12 MP to 48 MP. When you need to capture a long-distance shot, there’s Super Res Zoom that extends to 8x. The front sensor has 10.5 MP with a ƒ/2.2. One thing I noticed during the shootout is color. Although the stills on both cameras look great, more often than not, the iPhone had more vivid colors while the Pixel delivered more natural hues. A quick note. The first pictures in each sliders are images shot with the Pixel 9 while the second come from the iPhone 16.  I took both phones for a walk around my neighborhood, snapping shots. One of my favorites is a picture of a baby blue Lincoln Capri. For once, the Pixel 9 result is more oversaturated, displaying a deeper blue than the actual color. As far as detail is concerned, the iPhone was the winner with cleaner elements. Zoom in on the white wall tires, and you can make out the finer etching on the hubcaps as well as the cracks in the sidewalk. It was more difficult to pick a winner on the next shot – a colorful poster of a man with a captivating gaze. I spent about 20 minutes trying to find fault with either camera; I even had my boyfriend, a professional photographer, look. And outside of tiny differences such as fine creases in the poster, as displayed by the Pixel 9, this was a virtual dead heat. As expected, the Pixel had slightly deeper colors in a shot of a charcuterie board. However, from the random pattern on the tabletop to the seeds in the sliced tomatoes, I was surprised to see that the iPhone also displayed sharper details. While some people prefer more natural colors, I don’t particularly mind a little oversaturation, especially in this shot of sample doughnuts on tap at a local shop. While both images look absolutely delectable, the brighter sheen on the chocolate-dipped pastry from the iPhone was more appealing than the Pixel. Zooming in on both shots, the phones were almost even detail-wise. However, the Pixel’s results were slightly crisper than those of its competitor. It was the same story in a picture of a shelf of flowers outside the local grocery store. Once again, the iPhone had the more vibrant hues, with the Pixel 9 delivering better detail. A quick zoom-in on the grate at the bottom of the shot lets you see a clearer view of the design. Meanwhile, the marigold petals were fuzzier on the iPhone 16. A shot of a brownstone produced a dead heat in terms of color and details. I pored over both images side by side, and outside of extremely minor details, the level of sharpness was nearly equal. For this test, I took two shots with each phone, one with the lights dimmed as far as my dimmer switch could go and the other with the lights turned out. The Pixel produced a more accurate color in the low-light shot, as my Hulk and Sully figurines looked darker on the iPhone. Looking at the lettering on the Yamaha soundbar and the old camera, the Pixel’s shot has cleaner results. In the no-light images, the iPhone had richer color, particularly on the golden dragon statue, the pink tin, and the Hulk. While you can’t make out any of the lettering on the soundbar, the Pixel gave better details on the camera lettering. This isn’t a contest. The Pixel did a much better job capturing my skin tone, makeup, and hair color than the iPhone. If not for how well it captured how badly my eyebrows need threading and the smaller pores on my face, I would have thought I accidentally enabled a beauty filter. Google has done a great job on zoom, but Apple’s not too far behind. I took a shot of a memorial plaque. The cameras are evenly matched in terms of color, and while you can totally read the names in both shots. However, the Pixel was more legible and had cleaner lines in a night shot of New York City traffic from a rooftop. The Pixel excelled with clearer shots of the taillights and surprisingly better color. I captured some NYC fauna munching on an errant chicken bone. You can see individual rat hairs in the Pixel shot, while the critter looked a lot blurrier on the iPhone. However, you could see the critter’s little feet better on the iPhone. Neither of my night shots of the Chrysler building came out the best. The Pixel’s version had lots of visual noise, while the iPhone’s was blurry. When it comes to taking panos, I prefer the Pixel as it has more accurate guidelines to produce a more even capture. On the iPhone, it’s more of a freestyle deal. My hand dropped a little, and the iPhone threw up a prompt so I could course-correct it, but the damage was already done. In terms of color and detail, the phones produced nearly identical results. This round was tough, with both phones notching wins in specific categories. But the round goes to the Pixel for its consistent color accuracy and crisp detail. They’ll keep going and going and going. I ran the Gizmodo battery test on both phones side-by-side, with the brightness set to 200 nits and streaming a 24-hour YouTube video. The Pixel 9’s 4,575 mAh battery lasted 22 hours and 32 minutes, which is not too shabby. The iPhone’s 3,561 mAh battery tapped out at 23:29. I don’t know how Apple does it with all that performance, but it continues to pop out with powerful products without sacrificing longevity. When a new smartphone line comes out, it’s easy to get caught up in the hype of the more expensive versions. But spare a glance at the entry-level devices that offer an affordable option, which might trump all the fancy bells and whistles of the more premium versions in this day and age. The iPhone ultimately wins this face-off in a hard-fought battle between the iPhone 16 and Google Pixel 9. Not only does Apple offer more configurations and colors of the iPhone 16, but it’s also more powerful and lasts longer on a charge. But before you write the Pixel 9 off, remember it has some serious photography chops. And depending on how the full version of Apple Intelligence plays out, it might have the best smartphone AI. Plus, it didn’t do too badly on the battery test, and it’s a pretty phone in its own right, as it’s doing its best iPhone impersonation. But if you want the best entry-level smartphone, the iPhone 16 is it. \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The iOS 18.2 beta has a ton of awesome features you can try right now, like the Image Playground app and upgraded writing tools.\n         \n          The ‘Zero’ AR glasses run web apps and includes self-made lenses.

Here’s how it works.\n Polar is launching a new sporty smartwatch that builds on its stylish craft with the robustness you'd expect from a fitness partner. In a press release, Polar debuted the Vantage M3 smartwatch, a sporty alternate following the launch of the Vantage V3. The M3 features a 1.28-inch AMOLED display to replace Polar's old MIP screen. The company states this upgraded touchscreen should provide users with a more vibrant screen that retains its clarity in outdoor conditions. Users can also enable the M3's AOD (always-on display mode) for workout stats at a glance. Gorilla Glass protects the M3's display for an added layer of protection against nicks and scratches. The post reiterates the 2023 launch of the Polar Elixir biosensor, which is featured on the Grit X2 Pro. The company states consumers interested in this \"next-gen\" sensor fusion platform can experience it on its sporty M3. The back of the device is where the magic happens as the M3 catalogs your heart rate with its 4th-gen OHR sensor. SpO2 levels are made readily available alongside skin temperature readings. Additionally, Polar states users have an on-wrist ECG by placing a finger on the M3's button. The device requires 30 seconds before delivering its heart analytics. Polar states those looking to stay active will find the M3 loaded with over 150 sports profiles, as well. Sleep tracking capabilities are the other side of the M3, as the post states it delivers SleepWise, Sleep Plus Stages, and Nightly Recharge. The latter is Polar's \"overnight recovery measurement.\" According to the company, this feature lets the M3 inform you how well you've rested/recovered from the previous day's shenanigans. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android What's more, Polar states it's provided the Vantage M3 with on-wrist map navigation capabilities. The watch contains a dual-frequency GPS, which should deliver a more accurate telling of your current location. The M3 features a full-color map experience, meaning users will find an \"accurate\" visual representation of the surrounding buildings, streets, places, and more. The company adds that users can combine Komoot with the M3 for \"turn-by-turn guidance.\" Other specifications include the M3's 32GB of storage. Moreover, the watch contains a 310mAh battery. Polar states the device can last up to seven days in \"smartwatch mode\" or 30 hours in \"training mode.\" The Polar M3 is available today (Oct 23) in Greige Sand and Night Black. Users can pick up the device for $399. Nickolas is always excited about tech and getting his hands on it. Writing for him can vary from delivering the latest tech story to scribbling in his journal.

            "content": "No offers found I might finally be able to go all Android, all the time soon. \nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.\n Android 15 is now available on Pixel devices! Along with the myriad of changes and new features is a taskbar update that transforms Android tablets in a way that’s been sorely needed for a long time. In short, the taskbar can finally be pinned like it can on a desktop OS, and app pairs can be easily made and pinned for quicker productivity.  Android Central Labs is a weekly column devoted to deep dives, experiments, and a focused look into tech you didn't know you needed. It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between. You’ll be able to check out these changes on a Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold first, but they’ll be headed to plenty of other Android foldable phones and tablets soon. Of course, just because it’s now finally part of Android doesn’t mean you weren’t able to use these features on some other devices on the market, including foldables like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and tablets like the Honor MagicPad 2. In fact, the Honor MagicPad 2 is the very device I’m writing this article on and has been my go-to productivity device for over the past two weeks since Hurricane Helene devastated my hometown. It, along with the Honor Magic V3, has been the device combination I never knew I needed until I had no power, no home internet connectivity, and no real way to do my at-home job. The combo is made possible by what the company calls Honor Magic Ring which enables instant screen, connection, and control sharing between Honor devices in a way that’s been utterly clutch during this difficult time.  Let’s say you had a work-from-home job like me but had no internet connection or power at your house, and no cafes or other places with reliable internet were open because your entire town didn’t have running water. That’s the exact scenario I found myself in over these past two weeks, and it left me with an interesting problem to solve: how do I continue to do my job? At first, I figured I’d just use the hotspot on my phone to tether the Honor MagicPad 2 and carry on as usual. Problem is that I’m on a grandfathered T-Mobile plan with limited hotspot data and no way to increase this limit without changing my plan. I’ve kept this cheaper plan for well over a decade and this isn’t going to be the thing that changes that, so that option was out.  So I decided to dive a little deeper into the Honor Magic Ring, a technology that pairs Honor devices together in a way that others would be envious of. Two swipes and two quick taps mirrored my Honor Magic V3’s large foldable display onto the tablet, letting me run it split-screen alongside Honor’s note-taking app on the tablet. I was even able to stream music from my phone to the Honor MagicPad 2’s unbelievably good speakers, helping to closely recreate the feeling of working in my (now dark) basement office. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Since the Honor MagicPad 2 can easily make and save app pairs, it was easy to quickly launch into my mirrored workspace with notes on one side of the screen and my phone’s screen on the other. Once I had this set up, I was golden. I wrote from the comfort of the large tablet display, then used the mirrored phone display to upload things to Google Drive or Android Central’s CMS. Because I was using my phone and not tethering off the data connection, I was able to use my unlimited phone data plan like it was natively running on the tablet. At one point, I accidentally figured out how to change the mirrored phone screen into a full screen tablet display ON the tablet, taking things one step further.  So while I’ve really been enjoying how deeply Honor ties its products together, a few small changes will take things to the next level. Android 15’s new pinnable taskbar will complete the “laptop experience.” By that, I mean a dedicated taskbar at the bottom that can be used to launch and swap between running apps quickly. Some tablets like the OnePlus Pad 2 let you temporarily pin the taskbar, but on Android 15, you'll be able to pin it permanently like a laptop. I fully expect this feature to come to all Android tablets that get the Android 15 update, too. Next, I’d love to see more enhanced content sharing between devices. Honor launched it’s revamped Magic OS 8 interface with the Honor Magic 6 series earlier in 2024 — including a clever new side-mounted share UI — but there’s no easy way to drag-and-drop content between devices using split-screen windows. Copying and pasting text between devices works very well, but moving images or other media is still clunkier than I would like, requiring you to use Quick Share or Honor Share to get them there instead of just dragging and dropping between windows. Lastly, Honor’s Magic OS doesn’t let you force all apps into a split screen view. This doesn’t make much sense to me since it lets you float any app and then adjust its aspect ratio freely, so I’m not sure what the hold up is here. What I ultimately drew from this forced experiment was that tablets are truly ready to replace laptops for a large number of tasks — even if they are a bit clunky at time — making it possible to do a large majority of my job from a device that’s got a lot better battery life than a laptop. Now, if we could just get Adobe to put the FULL Creative Cloud suite on Android, or at least essentials like the full version of Photoshop, so I can ditch the Windows or Mac laptop forever.

Here’s how it works.\n Since the early days of VR, we've heard the promise that it could challenge traditional sports-watching. Why watch the Warriors game on your flatscreen TV when you could (virtually) sit courtside and see your sports heroes up close as if you'd paid thousands to hang out with the celebs and venture capitalists? On Saturday, I strapped on my Meta Quest 3, opened the Xtadium app, and transported myself to the Toyota Center in Houston for the Warriors-Rockets game, one of 52 basketball games streamed in VR for free for the 2025 season. I had a blast...but I also didn't make it a full half. And not because the Warriors almost blew a 30-point lead! Your typical TV broadcast uses an eagle-eyed view above the court, interspersed with close-ups of yelling coaches and slo-mo replays. But in VR, it's all about you \"being there,\" so they place 360-degree cameras at center court and above each basketball hoop so you can look wherever you want, immersed in the action with the play-by-play commentary mixed with the actual sounds of the court. At its best, NBA on Quest really does feel immersive. From the backboard cameras, you get close-up views of the players' faces and how they dance in patterns across the court to shake off pursuit, far better than you can from the usual top-down view. I wish Curry hadn't been injured for the game, but seeing my other faves splashing down 3s and bullying the Rockets on defense was fantastic. But there's a reason why broadcasts default to a top-down view in arena sports: you need a wide, tall vantage to see the full flow of a game for fast breaks and long passes. And the default side-view camera for Xtadium broadcasts is weirdly low to the ground — probably to avoid blocking people behind it. You feel like a child staring up at giants from the floor.  There's a bigger problem: If you're close up on the action on one side and then there's a fast break, it's completely disorienting to suddenly jump to a courtside angle, then to the other hoop. There's no warning, so you jerk your neck left or right trying to re-find the dribbling player. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android I missed a few highlights because of the hectic camera-warping, and I found myself watching the floating TV screen above the arena at times because it was easier to follow. That obviously defeats the whole purpose of basketball in VR! Lastly, you have to accept that you're not at the arena; you're wearing a 1.1-pound headset for 2.5 hours, your eyes straining unless you add prescription lens inserts, and you're sitting alone. The Xtadium app lets you see your mixed-reality surroundings beside and behind you, but if you're sitting on a couch or in bed, all you're really seeing is that arena. When you're on the commercial break sitting and watching giveaways, cheerleaders, and other fan distractions without being able to talk to anyone, it's a bit lonely! For all those reasons, I took the headset off before the half and switched to my local broadcast to give my tired eyes and twisting neck a break. IMMERSIVE NBA WEEKEND!!Friday: Bulls at Bucks.🔴🟢Saturday: Thunder at Bulls.🔵🔴Remember we also have multi-game nights with all NBA League Pass games!#NBA #IMMERSIVE #BULLS #BUCKS #THUNDER #Sports #fyp #VR pic.twitter.com/lM3mAoTCJuOctober 25, 2024 I know this goes against the usual broadcast strategy of curating what people see, but there's one obvious solution to make VR sporting events less hectic and more immersive: Give us camera control. Let us point a controller or use hand tracking to select a back-court or side-court view at any time so we can decide which \"seat\" we're in at any given moment! That way, we can decide to stay in one spot (as if we really were at the game) or jump angles when we're ready for it, not when the broadcast team thinks we are. I also think it should be easier to swap from the immersive courtside view to your mixed-reality living room at any moment, especially during commercial breaks! If you're at home watching the game, you'll want to check in on family, pets, or your phone without taking the headset fully off. If Xtadium makes watching VR broadcasts less \"traditional\" and more interactive, then it would truly feel next-gen! As it is, I'll tune in again for the next Warriors game in VR — December 8 against the Timberwolves — to see Steph's antics up close, but I still don't think I'll last the whole game.   Immerse yourself Want to dive into VR games and broadcasts without spending too much? I love my Quest 3, but it's on the expensive side; the Meta Quest 3S costs $200 less but uses the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip, 8GB of RAM, and full-color mixed-reality cameras to keep you grounded in your living room. Aside from VR broadcasts, it has a wide array of fun VR sports games to keep you active in your living room! Michael is Android Central's resident expert on wearables and fitness.

It's certainly nothing special if you're looking for peak performance, but those wanting a decent phone at a low price point might appreciate this deal. Samsung Galaxy A35 5G: $399.99 $299.99 at Amazon The Samsung Galaxy A35 5G is currently $100 off at Amazon, representing a 25% discount on a phone that's already pretty reasonably priced. This phone is a pretty basic device overall, sporting a solid battery life and a nice AMOLED display—especially given the price. If you're already a fan of the Samsung Galaxy ecosystem and you're looking for a phone that won't break the bank, this might just be your stop. Price comparison: Best Buy - $324.99 | Walmart - $339.92 ✅Recommended if: you're looking for a super affordable phone that doesn't compromise too much; battery life is a major selling point for you; you want a device that's going to come with years of Android updates. ❌Skip this deal if: you need a phone with top-tier performance; you want something with a headphone jack. The Samsung Galaxy A35 5G is a no-frills, budget-friendly phone. That's why we've chosen it as our top pick for the best cheap Android phone for Galaxy fans, and this price makes it look even more appealing. We love the A35's 6.5-inch AMOLED display, which sports a 120Hz refresh rate, as well as its solid battery life backed by a 5,000mAh battery. This phone also comes with 128GB of storage, a microSD port for expandable storage of up to 1TB, and four years of Android updates. While we do like the A35, it's worth noting that you can't expect it to perform as well as Samsung's premium offerings. Performance certainly isn't going to blow anyone away with just 6GB of RAM and the Exynos 1380 processor, but this is a price point that's truly hard to beat for what's being offered.

Best Buy has cut $1,700 off the 100-inch 4K Hisense Class U8 Series TV, representing a 34% discount on a certifiably massive display. This TV features Hisense's ULED Mini-LED, offering 4K and four times as many pixels as a regular Full HD TV.

Hisense TVs have developed name-brand recognition by this point, and while the U8 Class Series is our top mid-range pick for the best 4K TVs to use with Chromecast, the 100-inch version doesn't exactly fall into the mid-range price category so much as its smaller sizes. However, this discount chops an impressive $1,700 off the TV's price, so if you're in the market, now might be a great time to buy. The 100-inch Hisense U8 Class Series sports a 144Hz regular refresh rate with motion frame rate enhancements backed by Motion Rate 480. As such, this is a solid option for high-speed movie or show watching, gaming, or really anything where you want to catch each and every frame.

Here’s how it works.\n Update (October 21, 11:50 am ET): AYN has revealed the full list of specs, along with colors and pricing.  While the temperatures outside continue to drop, the Android gaming handheld scene is starting to heat up. AYN surprised many by announcing its next handheld in the Odin 2 Portal.  There are a few key differences between the Odin 2 and the upcoming Odin 2 Portal, starting with the display. The Odin 2 sports a 6-inch LCD display paired with a 60Hz refresh rate, while the Odin 2 Portal features a 7-inch AMOLED screen, with a 120Hz refresh rate.  Something that remains unchanged is that AYN will continue to lean on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 with the Odin 2 Portal. This might come as a bit of a surprise given that the Ayaneo Pocket S and upcoming Pocket EVO are powered by the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2.  We aren't really sure if this is due to an exclusive deal between Ayaneo and Qualcomm, or if AYN would rather just stick with what it knows. In reality, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 still provides more than enough oomph for a dedicated Android gaming handheld.  Not much else is known about the Odin 2 Portal just yet, as we'll likely have to wait until the Indiegogo campaign is live. We're curious to see what storage and RAM configurations there are, and of course, how much it will cost.   AYN has been fairly quiet in 2024, with the only major release coming in the form of the PS Vita-like Odin 2 Mini back in June. Besides that, the Android gaming handheld space has been dominated by the likes of Ayaneo, and more recently, Retroid with the Pocket 5 and Pocket Mini.  Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Speaking of which, the Odin 2 Portal appears to be a direct competitor to the Ayaneo Pocket EVO. The EVO was announced in early August but has yet to actually be released, although the Indiegogo page says it's expected to arrive sometime in November. It too features a 7-inch OLED display but with a higher 165Hz refresh rate, and a starting price of $499.  It's been about a week since AYN initially announced the Odin 2 Portal, leaving us with quite a few questions about the upcoming handheld. In that time, a bit of information has trickled out, but now, we know pretty much everything there is to know about the Odin 2 Portal.  Initially, it was expected to only be available in two colors, but AYN is \"Indigo\" color joins the Silver and Black options. This is definitely going right for the nostalgia, as it looks fairly similar to the GameCube colorway.  We already knew that Odin 2 Portal would be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, and sport a 7-inch OLED display. However, AYN has revealed the rest of the spec-sheet for its next handheld. Besides the screen and design, these specs pretty much match up to what AYN offered with the Odin 2. The only major difference is that the Odin 2 Portal ditches the 256GB of storage option while introducing 1TB of storage.  Lastly, AYN revealed how much the Odin 2 Portal is going to cost. Along with the different configurations, there are also three different phases for pricing. It all starts with the Indiegogo Super Early Bird, as the Base model comes in at just $299, complete with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.   The \"Pro\" version includes 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage and costs $379. Rounding out the pack is the Odin 2 Portal \"Max\" with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage for $479. However, the Super Early Bird campaign won't last long, as there will be limited quantities in this price bracket.  Once satisfied, the IGG Early Bird period will kick in, raising prices across the board. The Odin 2 Portal Base will cost $329, with the Pro priced at $399 and the Max coming in at $499. After the Indiegogo campaign has come to an end, the retail pricing will be in effect, with price tiers of $349, $429, and $529, respectively.  Those interested in pre-ordering the Odin 2 Portal will be able to do so beginning on October 23 at 8 am ET.    Sleek, comfortable, and powerful Although we don't yet have all of the Odin 2 Portal details, it's clear that this is going to be one of the best gaming handhelds of the year. We just have to hope it won't be made available at an exorbitant price.  Andrew Myrick is a Senior Editor at Android Central.

Here’s how it works.\n Earlier this year, OnePlus dropped an unexpectedly incredible budget-minded phone and now the OnePlus 12R is at one of best prices we've ever seen. Best Buy is selling it for a cool $70 off, making this legit flagship killer phone and even more killer price just after Halloween. As Harish said in his OnePlus 12R review, this is the return of the \"flagship killer\" that OnePlus became famous for. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor inside is faster than anything else you'll find at this price, and OnePlus's famous ultra-fast charging tech means you'll never have battery anxiety again. Seriously, 20 minutes on the included charger and you're good to go for an entire day. It's game-changing in the best of ways, and it'll make you completely forget about worrying about battery life ever again. Get the phone you want for a lot less including blazing-fast charging, a processor that can handle anything you throw at it, an incredibly eye-friendly OLED screen, and more for $70 off on Best Buy. Aside from amazing processing power and battery life, the OnePlus 12R features one of the most eye-friendly OLED screens on the market. Forget Apple, Google, or Samsung, OnePlus has gone out of its way to ensure that the OnePlus 12R won't give you headaches or eye aches with its fantastic anti-flicker technology. For folks like me who are particularly sensitive to the harsh dimming methods often employed in LED technology, this phone has been a life saver. Beyond that, OnePlus's Oxygen OS software is filled to the brim with features and a UI you're going to love. You'll get all the same features as the more expensive OnePlus 12, plus great software support for the next four years including three major Android updates. In fact, the Android 15-based Oxygen OS 15 open beta was just released for the OnePlus 12 and 12R, making them the first Android phones in the U.S. to receive Android 15 immediately after Google Pixel phones. Wondering about the rest of the phone? Don't worry, because OnePlus' build quality and haptics are among the best in the industry. This one sports an IP64 water and dust resistance rating, so it's good to go for sandy beaches and rainy days; just don't submerge it in the water for a long time. Plus, the camera is surprisingly capable given the price, going toe-to-toe with the more expensive OnePlus 12 in my camera tests.

You also get a 5,000mAh battery, stereo speakers, and more. ✅Recommended if: you want a well-rounded yet affordable Android smartphone with practical features like NFC, good ingress protection, and long software support. ❌Skip this deal if: you want top-of-the-line everyday performance, great cameras, and would rather have a phone that's a bit more compact. Samsung's Galaxy A-series devices are (and have always been) renowned for offering excellent value for money, and the Galaxy A35 5G is no different. Hands down one of the best Samsung phones available out there, the mid-ranger offers many features that are usually found in smartphones costing over two to three times as much. The Samsung Galaxy A35 5G is a well-built device with flat front and back panels, and a plastic frame sandwiched between them. Its 6.6-inch Super AMOLED panel sports a resolution of 1080x2340 pixels and a 120Hz refresh rate. Under the hood, the Galaxy A35 5G features Samsung's homegrown Exynos 1380 chipset and 6GB of RAM. While this hardware obviously can't go against high-end flagships like the Galaxy Z Fold 6, it's more than sufficient for things like web browsing, multimedia consumption, and even some light gaming. The smartphone also comes with 128GB of internal storage, and there's even a good ol' microSD expansion slot thrown in the mix. Then there's the IP67 certification, which means minor splashes shouldn't be an issue at all. Talking about software, the smartphone runs Android 14 (with One UI 6.1) out of the box, and thanks to Samsung's excellent update policy, it'll get up to four years of OS updates and five years of security patches. The triple-lens primary camera setup can take decent-quality photos and videos, and you also get a 13MP front-facing camera for selfies and video calls. All modern connectivity and I/O options are there, and the whole package is backed by a 5,000mAh battery with 25W wired charging support. Samsung Galaxy A35 5G has its fair share of limitations too. The inclusion of a virtual proximity sensor is a letdown, and the third macro lens at the back doesn't do much. That said, for a smartphone priced this low, we really can't complain.

Here’s how it works.\n Rugged smartphone maker DOOGEE has just launched its latest model, the S200. This tough little device isn’t just built to last; it's also the first 5G smartphone in the DOOGEE S lineup. Like the leading rugged smartphones on the market, the DOOGEE S200 is built to handle harsh conditions. With its tough components and aerospace-grade aluminum body, it’s earned the MIL-STD-810H certification and IP69/IP69K ratings, making it resistant to water, dust, sand, and impacts. This means the phone has been put through rigorous drop tests to prove it can withstand just about anything. The S200 sports a 6.72-inch 120Hz main display and a handy 1.32-inch rear screen that quietly shows you the time and other quick info. Its rear camera setup includes a 100MP sensor boosted by AI and Morpho Imaging tech, plus a 20MP night vision mode and the ability to shoot 4K video. Doogee claims this rugged phone can take photos underwater at depths of up to 5 feet (1.5 meters), making it perfect for your aquatic escapades. Plus, with its AI doing all the heavy lifting on the settings, you can just point and shoot and pretend you're a professional photographer. Armed with the MediaTek Dimensity 7050 processor, the S200 delivers performance that won’t make you want to throw it against the wall in frustration (though it can probably take that beating since it's a rugged device, after all). It’s got Wi-Fi 6 for those who need speed and up to 32GB of RAM with 256GB of storage, so multitasking is as easy as pie. Its gigantic 10,100mAh battery supports 33W fast charging and reverse charging, meaning you can keep your phone alive all day. The S200 is rocking Android 14, so you know it’s got performance, stability, and energy efficiency on lock. It also comes with some privacy features like fingerprint recognition. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android The device retails for £260 on Amazon UK, and DOOGEE is currently offering a sweet £70 discount.

Here’s how it works.\n Here's a surprising duo you never knew was coming: Amazon's Prime and Apple TV Plus. Amazon announced in a Newsroom post that it will \"soon\" bring an Apple TV add-on to its Prime Video streaming service. The Senior Vice President and Head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, Mike Hopkins said in a statement, \"... we are proud to welcome Apple TV+ and its popular and critically-acclaimed shows, films and events to Prime Video.\" Hopkins also stated the inclusion of an Apple TV Plus add-on would give users a more \"personalized\" streaming experience with additional options. The company highlighted shows like The Morning Show, Palm Royale, Shrinking, and Hijack. Additionally, it stated a host of Apple Original films joined the fray, including the movie CODA. Sports lovers who already have Prime Video for the NFL's Thursday Night Football broadcasts can grab games from Apple TV Plus' MLS Season Pass. The MLB is featured on the streaming service every Friday for its \"Friday Night Baseball\" featurette. This brings a double-header to subscribers every Friday. Prime Video subscribers in the U.S. can grab the Apple TV Plus add-on for an extra $9.99 monthly. The subscription will roll out \"later this month,\" letting users watch extra content across multiple devices. Moreover, as Android Police noted, Amazon's Apple TV Plus add-on helps relieve stress for Android. The streaming service didn't previously have any \"native\" support on Android, but this will rectify that in one fell swoop.  You may not remember, but Android TV launched an Apple TV app back in 2020. Content is also available through Google TV; however, both avenues lack total support as the app doesn't offer \"purchases within the app.\" With the streaming service arriving soon on Prime Video, users will likely find a much smoother experience with the choice. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android In July, Amazon announced the rollout of its Prime Video UI redesign. It came with a navigation bar full of pre-made options like \"Prime,\" packed with content at no extra charge. Similarly, the bar features a section for add-on content. All subscription services tacked onto your already recurring Prime Video membership will appear beside the \"Prime\" icon. Apple TV Plus will likely fall into this category if purchased. Additionally, scrolling over an add-on's icon will display what you were watching as its hero image. Amazon stated generative AI found its way into the redesign to give users \"relevant content\" if they're stuck on what to watch. Nickolas is always excited about tech and getting his hands on it.

Here’s how it works.\n Whether or not you have any interest in owning or riding in a self-driving car, Qualcomm says that its automaker clients want to pack their cars with more AI technology. With its new Snapdragon Cockpit Elite and Ride Elite, the company is promising ambitious, futuristic AI capabilities that hover between exciting and science-fiction. Available starting in 2025, the 2nd-gen Cockpit Elite uses the same Oryon CPU tech found in its new Snapdragon 8 Elite CPUs—which were announced yesterday at the Qualcomm Summit—with 3X the CPU performance of the last Snapdragon Cockpit. It also sports a Hexagon NPU with 12X-boosted AI and an Adreno GPU capable of supporting an absurd 16 4K displays simultaneously in one car, as well as \"real-time ray tracing\" and \"immersive 3D experiences\" for \"critical visual information.\" I asked the Qualcomm team why any car would need that much graphical power; they explained that this allows your car's infotainment display to span the entire front dashboard while still leaving processing power for TVs on seatbacks for passengers and graphical augmentations on your side mirrors. Presumably, non-autonomous vehicles wouldn't need as many distracting screens, but luxury automakers would have that option.  The boosted CPU supports simultaneous tasks like navigation, music, calling, and gaming simultaneously. But the flashy star of Cockpit Elite, unsurprisingly, is the AI tech. Qualcomm says its Hexagon NPU is \"built to handle Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters.\" Each car's specific hands-free assistant would be trained on the car's manual so you could, for example, ask what a warning light means. Snapdragon Cockpit Elite would also \"learn and adapt to your preferences,\" Qualcomm claims, and even \"take actions automatically.\" This part of the presentation felt looser on hard details; I asked what exact preferences the AI could learn, and heard examples like your car routing you home without your input if you usually do so at that time. It could also recognize which backup route you like to take during heavy traffic, or guide another driver (like your spouse) towards your usual parking spot. In addition, Snapdragon Elite would recognize the number of passengers and change its usual patterns accordingly, like preventing phone notifications if someone else could hear them or using \"zonal audio\" to localize relevant audio to the driver while focusing on music for the passengers.  Qualcomm also announced the Snapdragon Ride Elite, which essentially pairs with Cockpit Elite as a single SoC for self-driving cars. Ride Elite supports up to 40 sensors, including multiple 16MP cameras with 360º FoV and passenger-facing infrared cameras. It's meant to capture signs, lanes, and objects clearly, as well as recognize passenger gestures. It simultaneously supports radar/lidar point-cloud processing, automotive security when parked, and other behavioral AI tricks like auto-rerouting around accidents, self-guided parking, and opening your sunroof depending on the weather.  All combined, the Qualcomm Snapdragon Cockpit Elite and Ride Elite seem to promise smarts that are good enough to power the talking AI car from Knight Rider. We'll have to see how much a powerful SoC like this costs, both for automakers and for consumers, and whether the ambitious AI promises actually lead to helpful automation for drivers.

The COROS PACE Pro is an upgrade over the PACE 3, with a 2X faster CPU and tripled RAM, five extra days and 16 extra dual-band hours of battery life, 3X faster wi-fi downloads, and downloadable offline maps instead of breadcrumb navigation. While the PACE 3 remains a great option for budget-minded runners, the PACE Pro arguably makes the APEX 2 a bit obsolete. Both the PACE Pro and APEX 2 cost $349, and the latter uses titanium instead of polymer and stronger sapphire glass. That aside, the PACE Pro has far better battery life, quadruple the storage, more accurate GPS, the same sensors, and the aforementioned AMOLED upgrade. COROS even says its maps zoom in three times faster than the APEX 2's. I've only had a few days with the COROS PACE Pro thus far, not enough to properly judge its new satellite chipset or heart rate accuracy, but the switch to AMOLED is a welcome one for my eyes, and even with the silicone band it doesn't feel especially heavy.  Its battery life has impressed me thus far, and it comes with a new keychain charging dongle that lets you plug any USB-C cable into it to charge your watch. It's a unique solution to the problem of proprietary charging cables. It's far too soon to say if this is one of the best running watches, but it has the exact same in-depth training software as other COROS watches, paired with excellent battery life and a full-color display that'll make the PACE Pro more appealing to some runners. Now that COROS has gone the AMOLED route, I'm excited to see how the PACE Pro compares to the $449 Garmin Forerunner 265, our current top pick. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android The COROS PACE Pro costs $349 and is available from coros.com now; it should become available from retailers like Amazon and REI soon. If you're still more of an MIP display fan, you thankfully still have plenty of options from the COROS PACE, APEX, and VERTIX series!

            "content": "No offers found There's even a surprising deal in here.  \nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.\n For years, we had to deal with a bunch of Chromebooks with little ability to differentiate one from another. That all changed with Google's Chromebook Plus initiative, making it easy to decide. And thanks to Prime Day, the decision is now much easier, as there are a few fantastic Chromebook deals to be had.  It all starts with the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3, which has helped play a part in the Duet line being \"the best selling Chromebook of all time.\" Just recently, Lenovo launched its successor, but that's fine by us, as the Duet 3 can be had for $150 off at Best Buy.  Part of what makes the Duet 3 so unique is that it's one of a handful of Chromebook tablets. It sports an 11-inch display with a gorgeous 2000 x 1200 (2K) resolution, while also including the Keyboard Case in the box. With this, you're able to get up and running in no time, without needing to worry about buying a case or keyboard separately. However, you will need to snag a USI 2.0 Pen if you want to use this to take notes. Lenovo IdeaPad Duet 3 Chromebook: $379 $229 at Best Buy Although there's a refreshed model now available, the Duet 3 is a steal at this price. You'll get decent performance while enjoying one of the few Chromebook tablets on the market.  If there's one device that I can't wait to review, it's the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus. I was fortunate enough to spend a few hours with it and I came away quite impressed. Coming as little surprise, this is about as premium of a Chromebook as it gets, before you get into the $999+ range.  It offers a beautiful 15.6-inch AMOLED display, along with the latest Intel Raptor Lake chip for power. However, this is also the first Chromebook to debut with the new \"Quick Insert Key.\" This aims to make you even more productive, giving you access to documents and tools that you rely on.  Although this isn't technically a deal specific to Prime Day, you'll get a $50 gift card for free when picking one up from Best Buy. Plus, Google includes 12 months of Gemini Advanced for free with every new Chromebook Plus device.    Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus: $699.99 w/ free $50 Gift Card and 12 months of Gemini Advanced Announced alongside the Chromebook Duet 11, Samsung is making a splash in its return to the Chromebook scene. This time, it comes courtesy of the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, a stunning and slim device that aims to compete with Acer at the top end of the market. Speaking of high-end Chromebooks, Acer's Chromebook Spin 714 remains a favorite of ours, even if it lacks the \"Plus\" moniker. You'll still enjoy all of the same great features as the updated Chromebook Plus Spin 714 but without the higher price tag.  This is thanks to Best Buy slashing the price by almost $300, bringing it down to just $429 for a limited time.  With the Chromebook Spin 714, we have a convertible design, allowing you to use it as a traditional laptop, or flip it over to write on the screen. Under the hood, it's powered by Intel's Core i5-1335U, paired with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Not only that, but it also features a variety of ports, including Thunderbolt 4 and HDMI 2.1.  Acer Chromebook Spin 714: $699.99 $429.99 at Best Buy This too has been replaced by a newer model, but this is the one you should consider. The Spin 714 remains one of the best Chromebooks, and now you can save almost $300 on it.  Another fantastic deal to be had is for the ASUS Chromebook Plus CX3402 over at Best Buy. Normally, this Chromebook retails for about $500 but is down to just $349 as part of Best Buy's 48-hour Flash Sale.  When looking at the CX3402 next to the Spin 714, there's really not much in the way of differences between the two. At least when it comes to what these two Chromebooks are capable of. However, something that helps justify the lower price of the CX3402 is the non-convertible design and the omission of a touchscreen display. That's probably more of a concern if you were paying full price, but thankfully, you don't have to worry about that.  ASUS Chromebook Plus CX3402: $499 $349 at Best Buy Performance-wise, the ASUS Chromebook Plus CX3402 is identical to the Spin 714. But, as long as you're okay with not having a convertible design and a touchscreen display, this deal should be a no-brainer.  Rounding out the pack for some of the best last-minute Chromebook Prime Day deals is the Acer Chromebook 516 GE. This one has already been replaced by the Chromebook Plus 516 GE, but much like the Spin 714, that's not really a big deal. It also helps that with a newer version available, we're able to enjoy deals like saving $90 on the 516 GE at Amazon.  Most of the time, I'm a fan of high-end options like the HP Dragonfly Pro Chromebook or the Framework Chromebook Laptop. However, Acer managed to surprise me with the Chromebook 516 GE. The \"claim to fame\" of the 516 GE is that it's one of a few gaming-focused options in the space. These include things such as RGB keyboard backlighting, along with a 120Hz refresh rate packed into the 15.6-inch IPS display.  Acer Chromebook 516 GE: $599.99 $509.99 at Amazon Who knew that you could game with Chromebooks? Not only that, but Acer's Chromebook 516 GE is designed with gaming in mind. It sports a 15.6-inch display, complete with a 120Hz refresh rate, and even a keyboard with RGB backlighting.  Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Andrew Myrick is a Senior Editor at Android Central.

            "content": "No offers found Chromebooks have come a long way. \nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.\n  Beyond the Alphabet is a weekly column that focuses on the tech world both inside and out of the confines of Mountain View. After Apple recently announced its latest M4-powered series of MacBook Pro's, the company made another change that was unexpected. Every current MacBook in Apple's lineup now ships with 16GB of RAM as a base, an upgrade from the previous minimum of 8GB. Originally, I was going to compare the MacBook Air to the current crop of Chromebooks until I realized that you can't get a new MacBook for less than $1,100. Meanwhile, the most expensive Chromebook is the new Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, which is $400 cheaper. Yes, I know there are still a few HP Dragonfly Pro Chromebooks floating around, but those aren't as widely available and are clearly being phased out. After some prodding in a meeting, I turned my attention to a comparison that does make sense: Chromebook vs. iPad.  Currently, there are six different iPad models to choose from, starting with the iPad (10th generation) for $349 and going all the way up to the M4 12.9-inch iPad Pro for $1,299. Meanwhile, the cheapest Chromebook that's been released in 2024 is the HP Chromebook 14-inch, which retails for $249. From there, we have a variety of options at different price points, and while the majority of them are laptops, there are a couple of tablets thrown into the mix. These include the likes of the ASUS Chromebook CM30, and more recently, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11.  While both of these are tablets, ASUS and Lenovo include a keyboard case in the box. In doing so, it removes any potential stress and additional cost for those who want a true 2-in-1 device. On the other hand, no matter what iPad you're considering, the only other thing that comes in the box is a charging cable. Making matters worse for the iPad is that if you want to go with first-party accessories, Apple's Magic Keyboard Folio is priced at $249. Plus, if you want a stylus, tack on another $79, bringing the grand total to about $680. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android That immediately puts the \"cheapest\" iPad in the same price bracket as the Galaxy Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Plus Spin 714. It is also almost $300 more expensive than the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11. And we haven't even talked about the hardware or specs.  So, what are you getting with the base model iPad for $349? It's powered by the A14 Bionic SoC, which debuted with the iPhone 12 and iPad Air in 2020. This is paired with 4GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage, and if you want to use it anywhere, there are Cellular options available. I'm not going to sugarcoat anything here, but there's a good reason why Apple is able to \"get away\" with using a four-year-old processor without facing much backlash. Since Apple controls the entire \"stack,\" it's able to better optimize the software and hardware, when it relies on older processors. This is also why Apple was able to maintain its position as a leader in the industry when it comes to providing software updates for longer than the competition.  As for Chromebooks, the aforementioned ASUS Chromebook CM30 is powered by the MediaTek Kompanio 520. It also sports 4GB of RAM and 64GB of non-upgradeable storage. But as I mentioned before, ASUS includes the detachable keyboard folio case in the box, which is already a huge benefit, even if you don't plan to use it all that much. Performance is where things take a sharp turn. On Geekbench, the Kompanio 520 offers a single-core score of 510 and a multi-core score of 1532. Despite being four years old, the A12 Bionic achieved scores of 1590 and 4247, respectively. Let me put it this way: the cheapest iPad is closer to the Intel-powered Galaxy Chromebook Plus in terms of performance. It's not even close; the iPad wins by a landslide here.  Software is the key to everything, and this is where a sub-$300 Chromebook outshines even a $1300 iPad. With a Chromebook, you not only have access to the ever-growing world of web apps and extensions, but the Play Store is also just a click away. Not to mention that there's an even bigger repository of apps at your disposal if you feel comfortable enough to enable Linux support. On an iPad, everything is powered by either the App Store or Safari, and there is just a little bit of wiggle room for anything else. While you can use Chrome or Firefox on an iPad, you won't find any extension support, and for whatever reason, web apps don't always feel as fluid as they do on a Chromebook. While important, I'd argue that usability is even more important, especially when it comes to things like using more than one app at a time. The iPad is superb if you're trying to stay focused on one app, but it immediately begins to fall short when you want to toss another app into the mix.  \"But what about Stage Manager?\" You might be asking, and I'm glad you did. When enabled, it lets you use up to four different apps at the same time. Allowing you to resize and move them around with relative ease. There's even a slide-out \"dock\" of sorts, letting you basically work within different spaces that are comprised of different apps. Technically another app can be used, provided that you can remember that the Slide Over is at your disposal or even how to use it. But it's cumbersome at best, and downright useless more often than not. None of that is a problem with a Chromebook, as it works just like any other desktop operating system. The only difference comes when using either a ChromeOS tablet or a Chromebook with a convertible form factor. When doing so, it's more similar to using any Android tablet or iPad, with your app windows locked to a few different layouts. However, I'd still argue that Google's implementation is still a bit better. Instead of trying to guess where to put app windows, you can just swipe down from the top of the screen and pick from a few different layouts. These include being able to put an app off to the side and slide it back into view.  This might just sound like a puff piece for Chromebooks, and to a certain extent, it kind of is. But it's just because I feel as though we're finally moving away from the days of seeing a million different cheap Chromebooks that are underpowered or just bad. In years past, I would have likely recommended an iPad to just about anyone who asked, regardless of how they planned to use it. However, the landscape has shifted quite dramatically for Chromebooks. For one, with Chromebook Plus, you know exactly what the minimum specs are, so there's no need to worry about compromising. Regardless of whether you want a tablet or a laptop, you have options to choose from, both of which are going to be either in-line or less expensive than what you would spend on an iPad.   Best Chromebook in the Galaxy The Galaxy Chromebook Plus is a powerful ChromeOS machine, thanks to the Intel chip and 8GB of RAM. The 1080p OLED display is vibrant and you have enough ports and battery life to get you through the work day. Andrew Myrick is a Senior Editor at Android Central.

            "content": "No offers found It may be the most important VR device of all time. \nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.\n The Meta Quest 3S has been a wonderful escape from the clunkiness of life brought about by the aftermath of Hurricane Helene for me. Being able to literally jump into another world by popping a headset on during the day has been more than just mood-changing for me, it’s been an important part of recovery time to return to normal life again. Throughout this, the most impressive thing to me is how little of a compromise this feels when compared to the $200 more expensive Meta Quest 3. While the lenses aren’t as clear, I didn’t notice any other real differences while playing. Even with that in mind, most people won’t be able to appreciate the lens difference unless they’ve already used a Quest 3 before, anyway, so it’s a bit of a moot point. While the experience is unbelievably close to the Quest 3, I don’t want to write a full review after using it for just a week. Instead, I’ve come up with five takeaways and why this should absolutely be the VR headset you buy this year, especially if you’re a Quest 2 owner who’s looking to play games like Batman Arkham Shadow.  When I first put the headset on, I marveled at how similar the Meta Quest 3S’s color mixed reality vision was to that of the Meta Quest 3. It was easy to see the room around me, put my controllers on, and interact with things in the room — including petting my kitten who was roaming around. The best mixed reality games all feel and play nearly identically on the Meta Quest 3S. Turning your living room into a racket ball court in Racket Club still feels magical, and unique mixed reality-only games like Starship Home still transform your existing room into something new and special. In fact, I still had that funny feeling of something missing in the room every time I stopped playing Starship Home because the mixed reality quality was so convincing. For Meta Quest 2 owners upgrading to a Meta Quest 3S, color mixed reality will be the biggest, most immediate difference. Mixed reality simply doesn’t exist on a Quest 2. Calling the ultra low-res black & white passthrough vision “mixed reality” is simply inaccurate, and it’s this that will bring that immediate “wow” factor to your purchase.  I’ve already been able to play some Quest 3-exclusive games on the Meta Quest 3S that I’m not allowed to talk about yet, but let me tell you that the graphics on these titles are going to blow you away. This is a 100% full generational upgrade from the Meta Quest 2, and it’s immediately palpable on many of the biggest upcoming Meta Quest games. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android While some existing games you might have already played got impressive visual upgrades — The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners is one of the best examples of impressive updates to existing games — the new games coming out this year are the ones that’ll truly blow you away. That’s because it’s not just about the upgraded details, better textures, improved lighting, and other graphical improvements. It’s about scale. The extra RAM and 100% improved processing power over the Quest 2 mean that games made for the Quest 3 can feel bigger and more robust. Many Oculus Quest games from the 2019 and 2020 eras often felt like mobile games in a new perspective because of their graphical and environmental simplicity. Meta Quest 3 games feel straight out of the PS4 era of gaming, and that’s something to truly celebrate.  From day one, I was able to use nearly every single one of the best Meta Quest 3 accessories (link) that I had on hand with the Meta Quest 3S. The lone exception is the facial interface, which is a different shape and size compared with the Quest 3. But every alternative head strap I had, every controller accessory — including fancy golf clubs and controller grips — and every battery pack or haptic feedback vest worked with the Quest 3S without any tinkering. That means Quest 3S users have access to an entire year’s worth of third-party accessory work, allowing them to choose the best accessory for the job instead of settling with overpriced options that end up disappointing. That's a massive change from every other Meta Quest product launch, which often saw only first-party accessories available for months at a time. If you’re picking up a Quest 3S, I'd recommend two accessories to get a significantly better experience. First, grab a BoboVR M3 Pro head strap replacement. Its brilliant design helps offload the Quest 3S's weight from your face, balancing it better on your head with cushy, easily removable, washable padding. It also includes a magnetically hot-swappable, rechargeable battery pack that adds hours of playtime to your experience.  I'm also testing out KIWI Design's H4 and K4 head straps, both of which offer much better comfort over the stock strap while adding a big battery for additional playtime. KIWI Design prides itself on battery safety, which is something to think of since it's strapped to your head! Next, grab these inexpensive AMVR controller grips. They replace the battery cover on your Quest 3S controllers with one that has a grippy texture and a comfortable hand strap. That strap not only more evenly distributes the controller's weight but also makes it easier to throw things in VR since you can actually let go of the controller without it falling out of your hands. I personally dislike the stock facial interface for any Meta Quest headset and often prefer ones from AMVR or Kiwi Design, but neither company has one that works with the Quest 3S yet. Once I use one I like, I'll add a recommendation.  We just overhauled our best Meta Quest games list, and let me tell you how difficult it was to narrow down the selection of \"best games\" to just a few. The Meta Quest platform sports thousands of games, and while plenty of 2024 games have been phenomenal, there are still plenty of classics worth playing. New releases like Dimensional Double Shift put a new spin on the old VR classic Job Simulator by adding in multiplayer and hand tracking, plus a new theme with tons of unique interactions. Metal: Hellsinger VR takes the console classic into VR with a head-banging good original soundtrack and gameplay that feels straight out of the best Doom games. NFL PRO ERA 2025 just upgraded its gameplay and roster to give you the fantasy football experience you've been dreaming of, and Hotel RnR Rockstar Simulator lets you step into the shoes of a rockstar who is fed up with not getting their way all the time. In just a week, you'll be able to play Batman Arkham Shadow, the first original game in the Arkham franchise in a decade. That, of course, is a game for free with the Meta Quest 3S, so you don't have to purchase the game separately. And the upcoming Meta Quest games list is stacked with other big-name releases we're sure to love. Alien: Rogue Incursion is the first made-for-VR game in the classic Ridley Scott series. Skydance's Behemoth brings Shadow of the Colossus-style gameplay to VR, and Metro Awakening is an original VR entry into the acclaimed Metro 2033 series that gamers have loved for years.  The worst part of buying any new system is having to shell out a bunch of money to play games on it. That's where Meta Quest Plus comes in. It's a subscription service similar to something like Xbox Game Pass, giving you access to 22 of the best Quest games right away. Each Meta Quest headset comes with a three-month trial of the service, and it's just $7.99 per month thereafter. Here's how it works. A library of 20 games is available to play right away, giving you access to a regularly rotated, curated list of titles. You don't own these games, so be sure to play them when they're available. Beyond that, you'll get access to two games each month that you can claim permanently on your account. That's 24 games per year added to your library and accessible so long as you keep a subscription to the service. That's in addition to the regularly rotated list of 20 games, meaning you'll have plenty to play for just a few bucks a month.  Meta absolutely knocked it out of the park with the Meta Quest 3S. This is the Quest 2 follow-up the VR industry needs because it comes in at the price people want. A $299 headset is probably the single most important thing to get VR into more hands and on more heads, and a product as good as the Meta Quest 3S is going to absolutely blow people’s minds this Holiday season. I don’t hesitate at all when I say this is the most important VR product ever made. It takes all the lessons Meta learned from the Quest 2 era, adds in all the improvements made with Quest 3 hardware and the software experience over the past year, and somehow melds them perfectly into a $299 package. It’s an unbelievable feat for the company to have achieved, and yet, here it is for all to enjoy. The VR boom cycle is about to be back in business after a year of slow down, and the Meta Quest 3S is leading the charge.   Don't spend more! Get the Meta Quest 3S and get the best of VR gaming and mixed reality content with the same powerful processor in the Quest 3, the same controllers with advanced haptic feedback, and a massive library of content to enjoy every day.

Here’s how it works.\n  Beyond the Alphabet is a weekly column that focuses on the tech world both inside and out of the confines of Mountain View. Earlier this year, I wrote about how I hoped to see the Android equivalent of an iPad Mini. While we have plenty of options to choose from if you want a powerful tablet with a big screen, smaller tablets are usually packed with less-than-impressive specs. More recently, I've wondered whether a small and powerful Android tablet is really necessary, given that I always carry a foldable phone with me. In terms of performance, foldables take the cake, and it's not even close. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the OnePlus Open uses the 8 Gen 2, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold relies on the Tensor G4. Sure, the Pixel might fall short of the other two foldables I mentioned, but it's no slouch.  As for tablets, there just aren't that many options if you want flagship specs but a screen under 10 inches. Lenovo is really the only game in town, as the Legion Y700 sports an 8.8-inch screen and is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. That presents a different problem, however, as the Y700 isn't officially sold in the States, meaning that you have to go through Giztop or AliExpress to get one. The smallest flagship tablet that I've come across that is readily available, is the recently-released RedMagic Nova Gaming Tablet. It too makes use of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 but comes with a 10.9-inch screen. While Samsung ditched the 11-inch model with the Galaxy Tab S10, the Tab S9 and its Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is still available. But even then, we don't know how long that will be the case, and it's still too large. All the while, foldable phones offer screens that fall right within the size range that I would want. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is one of the smaller ones with its 7.6-inch display, while the Vivo X Fold 3 Pro offers up an even larger 8.03-inch panel. Unfortunately, Vivo's foldable presents the same problem as the Y700, as you can't just pick it up in Best Buy or on Amazon.  With all of that being said, do I really need to jump through a bunch of hoops just to get a powerful tablet? Or are foldable phones simply the better overall option for those who either have one or are considering one? The short answer to this question should be fairly obvious. But there are a few wrinkles that have kept me from coming to a definitive conclusion. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Foldable phones are mostly the better option, simply because they're both a phone and a tablet in a single device. With the work that Samsung, Google, and OnePlus have been putting into the software, the experience is also largely the same between each company's foldable phone and tablet offerings.  The biggest difference comes in the form of multi-tasking, at least to a certain extent. Many of the best Samsung phones and tablets include the ability to use DeX Mode, essentially turning your device into a Chromebook. However, unlike the Galaxy Tab S9 or Tab S10, the only way to use DeX on the Fold 6 is to either plug into an external display or connect to one wirelessly. Meanwhile, you can just tap a button on the Galaxy Tab keyboard and switch over from the traditional tablet interface to DeX mode. This isn't the case when looking at the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the Pixel Tablet. Even while running the latest Android 15 beta, I'm unable to do anything but mirror the screen from the 9 Pro Fold, which is simply disappointing. My disappointment is further compounded by the fact that you can use desktop windowing on an external display with the Pixel 9 Pro XL but not the Pro Fold. On the bright side, after enabling the \"Freeform windows\" toggle in Developer Options, I can have up to four free-floating windows on the Pixel Tablet. Things work surprisingly well, and Google has done an excellent job of making things look more aesthetically pleasing than in the days of old. The only downside is that this isn't a feature that's enabled out of the box, but I expect that to change sooner rather than later. Although OnePlus doesn't have a specific desktop mode for its Pad 2 or the OnePlus Open, it has another trick up its sleeve. You can actually use your phone from the Pad 2, bringing Phone Mirroring to a tablet, which is something I didn't have on my bingo card. Much like the experience is largely the same with Samsung devices, the various features and multitasking options are pretty similar between the OnePlus Pad 2 and Open.  One area where all of the tablets mentioned have an advantage is when using a stylus. Samsung includes one in the box, Google doesn't sell one at all but relies on the USI 2.0 standard, and while OnePlus does offer one, you have to buy it separately. But that's not the advantage that I'm talking about. Excluding the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which lacks stylus support, you'll have to contend with the crease on foldable phones. It's fine for the most part and is a lot better than it used to be, but the crease can still be a source of frustration. None of those problems exist with the slabs of glass on a tablet. Drawing a straight line is entirely dependent on your ability to actually draw a straight line. On the flip side, you don't exactly want to whip out the 14.6-inch Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra while you're waiting in line at the store and want to turn a picture into a meme. The same sentiment rings true even with the OnePlus Pad 2 and Galaxy Tab S9. Meanwhile, provided that you have the S Pen Fold Edition or Oppo Pen you can do exactly that with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 or OnePlus Open.  There's no arguing or denying that foldable phones are more versatile compared to the best Android tablets or even phones. However, there is one argument to be made, and it's the most important one of them all — price. Without taking trade-ins or deals into consideration, you could import the 16GB/512GB model of the Lenovo Legion Y700 2024 from Giztop for about $600. Heck, you could even go so far as to toss in the official leather case, Legion Gaming Controller G7, and Lenovo's Stylus Pen, and you would be looking at around $760. Meanwhile, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 starts at $1,899, which includes 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. If you want to match up the storage, the 512GB model will set you back just north of $2,000. Samsung doesn't offer the Fold 6 with 16GB of RAM, and that doesn't include the S Pen or case.   You're looking at another $60 for just the stylus or $100 if you want the official S Pen case. At that price, I could buy two Y700 tablets, complete with accessories, and still have money left over to snag a couple of different controllers or an external SSD to house my ROM collection.  Now, there's a good chance that you might be swayed into changing your mind in the very near future. The 2024 holiday shopping season is already underway, with Black Friday right around the corner.  If Prime Day was anything to go by, then I suspect that we'll see some pretty incredible deals pop up for both foldable phones and tablets. With that in mind, don't just jump at the first deal that you see just for the sake of it. Even still, I'm hoping to see some steep discounts on foldable phones, but I suspect there will also be plenty of tablet deals to be had.  For as much as I want foldable phones to take over the world and replace the slabs of glass that we've been reliant on for years, we're just not there yet. Frankly, I don't know if we'll ever actually get there with book-style foldables as flip phones continue to rise in popularity. Simply based on the price alone, and ignoring all of the convenience that foldables offer, tablets are still better. Now, I just need companies to release these small and powerful tablets in the U.S., so I don't have to pay extra just to get one imported. Andrew Myrick is a Senior Editor at Android Central.

Here’s how it works.\n Meta has once again surpassed all expectations of what a standalone VR headset can be for just $299. The Meta Quest 3S is quite literally a Quest 3 with the Quest 2's lenses and display, better hand tracking and low light tracking, a new mixed reality button on the headset, and all the exclusive games the more expensive Quest 3 gets. Enthusiasts will want to spend the extra money to get the better display and lenses of the Quest 3, but everyone else will likely choose the Quest 3S because of the price, yet get very little trade-off in the process. Powerful new chipset Excellent mixed reality quality Next-gen controllers and hand tracking Thousands of games, including Quest 3 exclusives A history of excellent monthly updates from Meta Unbelievable price Older lenses produce a dull image compared to Quest 3 90-degree FoV can feel constricting compared to PSVR 2 or Quest 3 No 3.5mm audio jack Why you can trust Android Central \n\n\nOur expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. When the Meta Quest 3S was first leaked, the idea of having a $299 Quest 3 headset seemed preposterous. How in the world could Meta possibly deliver a headset that's $200 cheaper without sacrificing the Quest 3's power, color mixed reality vision, new controllers with advanced haptic feedback, and all the improvements to the Quest ecosystem that have happened over the next year? Somehow, they've done it. The Meta Quest 3S is a triumph in nearly every way, from its highly polished onboarding presentation to the excellent mixed reality content that's been developed over the past year. It feels like a palpable upgrade from the Quest 2 and even sports some design and UX improvements over the more expensive Quest 3. Obviously, there have to be some concessions to get to a $299 price point but there are surprisingly few. The biggest is the display stack, as it uses the same lenses and display from the Quest 2 but still features plenty of visual upgrades and tweaks. That includes a next-generation processor, improved rendering and processing, and much more. If you're looking for a next-gen VR headset upgrade from a Quest 2 at an affordable price, you've found it.  The Meta Quest 3S retails for $299 and includes 128GB of storage, while the Meta Quest 3S with 256GB of storage retails for $399. Both models come in a white colorway and come with a pair of Quest 3 touch controllers, a preinstalled cloth head strap, and a preinstalled cloth facial interface. Every Meta Quest 3S comes with a free copy of Batman Arkham Shadow and 3 months of the Meta Quest Plus subscription service until April 2025. Some Meta Quest 2 accessories work on a Quest 3S, so you can keep some of those around instead of having to buy new ones. Likewise, most of the best Quest 3 accessories work on a Quest 3S, with the exception of the facial interface, which has a new design.  Meta has learned a thing or two about headset comfort over the past few years, but that doesn't mean the Quest 3S is perfect. It's only a gram lighter than the Quest 3, which was a few grams heavier than the Quest 2. All of this, despite still shipping with a cloth strap that I find generally uncomfortable, although it's fine for short play sessions. The biggest problem with the cloth strap is that it rests on the top of my ears and irritates my skin rather quickly. Meta is using the same Y-shaped top strap design it launched with the Quest 3, which means it better allocates weight across the head but still doesn't work anywhere near as well as the BoboVR M3 Pro head strap does, for instance. Beyond that, though, the Quest 3S is just as comfortable as the Quest 3 out of the box and maybe even more so thanks to the new facial interface design. The new, more padded, and supple face pad that was preinstalled on the headset feels wonderful. Historically, I couldn't wait to swap out the facial interface with a third-party one, but I've been pleasantly surprised by how comfortable this one is. The headset is also 20mm slimmer than the Quest 2, so it has a weight distribution closer to your face. Quest 3 is an additional 10mm slimmer than Quest 3S. However there are still three main reasons to choose a good third-party facial interface replacement once reputable companies release them. First is hygiene. The cloth is nice and soft but also absorbs sweat. Grab a $12 pair of silicone covers for now, especially if you sweat a lot or share the headset with other people. The second reason to replace the stock facial interface is because of lens fog. I haven't had issues with it during the review period because it's been cool and dry here, but as soon as the humidity ramps up again in half a year I'll need something more breathable. For now, Meta makes an excellent breathable facial interface with semi-transparent sides. I used this one at the Quest 3S hands-on event and loved it. Third, if you use glasses, some third-party facial interfaces have built-in glasses spacing adjustments. The default Meta Quest 3 facial interface includes a way to adjust for glasses, but the one on the Quest 3S doesn't. You'll need to use the glasses spacer in the box to do this which doesn't offer as many spacing options as the Quest 3 method. That said, the new interface design makes it far easier to swap out the facial interface than any other Quest headset to date. This has been improved with every generation, so it's good to see it continue to happen. But even if you don't swap out any of these modular parts right away, I think short play sessions will be comfortable enough. Thankfully, all the best Meta Quest 3 accessories work on the Quest 3S, except for the replacement of the facial interface. You'll need one specifically made for the Quest 3S. Keep in mind that the Quest 3S does not have a 3.5mm audio jack, so if you want to use headphones instead of the excellent built-in speakers on the Quest 3S arms, I recommend picking up a pair of PrismXR Vega T1 earbuds. Regular Bluetooth earbuds or headphones won't work in VR because Bluetooth's latency is too high. This can actually make you feel sick because of an odd disconnect between what your brain hears and what it sees. In my testing, I've found that the Quest 3S has the best battery life of any modern Quest headset. On average, I got around two and a half hours of use from a single charge, with more power-hungry games like Batman Arkham Shadow bringing that down to around 2 hours. I'd say if you were planning to just use the Quest 3S with the default head strap and facial interface, this is more than enough time before any kind of fatigue sets in. Grabbing a new head strap with built-in battery like the BoboVR M3 Pro or Kiwi Design H4 will add several hours of battery life and significantly better comfort overall, making it a worthwhile $50 upgrade.  If you directly compare the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S, this section holds the only real differences you'll notice. The Meta Quest 3S uses the same display and Fresnel lenses as the Meta Quest 2, so if you've only ever used a Quest 1 or Quest 2, you probably won't be particularly disappointed in the Quest 3S's display or lenses. All in all, they're fine and suit a $299 headset rather well. As with all Fresnel lenses, there's a small \"sweet spot\" right in the middle of each lens where you'll get the clearest view. Anything outside of this circle gets blurrier the closer you look to the edges. The Meta Quest 3S uses the same lenses and display as the Quest 2, foregoing most next-generation upgrades from the more expensive Quest 3. The 90-degree FoV on the Quest 3S's lenses feels a bit constricting compared to the substantially wider 110-degree FoV of the Quest 3. This difference cannot be understated, and it all melds together to show just how superior the lenses on the Quest 3 are. The Meta Quest 3S's lenses also adjust the same way as the Quest 2, so if you're coming from a Quest 2 you'll know exactly what to do. The only difference is that there's no 1/2/3 preset number in the middle of the lenses that changes as you adjust the spacing. Meta says it cut this mechanism to keep the manufacturing cost of the headset as low as possible, allowing it to hit that $299 price point. That being said, if you have an interpupillary distance (IPD) over 72mm you're probably going to find the Meta Quest 3S uncomfortable. If you find yourself in this boat, a 3D printed IPD expander like this one will push the lenses out a bit and help. If you plan to work in VR or use it for a lot of text-based applications, it makes more sense to spend the extra money on a Quest 3. Like the lenses, the display on the Meta Quest 3S is the same as the one on the Quest 2. It gets plenty bright, but the contrast is fairly low, the colors are a bit on the dull side, and the resolution is noticeably lower than the Quest 3's panels. As far as clarity is concerned, I'd say the resolution difference between Quest 3 and Quest 3S is similar to playing games at 1440p vs 1080p. The Quest 3S isn't as sharp, and fine detail gets a bit lost, but it's not offensively lower resolution. If there's any one area where the resolution and lenses make a big difference, it's for folks who want to work in VR. If that's going to be a big part of your headset usage, stick with the Quest 3.  The Meta Quest 3S and Quest 3 use identical controllers. These new controllers ditch the LED ring and tighten up some ergonomics for a much smaller profile than the Quest 2's controllers. Tracking is still done with LEDs, though, which are situated around the controller face and handles. Tracking is enhanced through better camera positioning around the headset—particularly the lower side-mounted cameras, which can see better along the sides and below the headset than on the Quest 2—and Meta's Horizon OS, which fills in any visual tracking gaps with gyro sensor data from inside the controller and an AI algorithm that predicts hand position based on arm and shoulder movements. The Meta Quest 3S uses the same advanced controllers as the Quest 3 and are powered by a single AA battery. Each controller is powered by a single AA battery. Based on my extended usage of the Quest 3 over the past year, you'll only need to swap them out once every two months or so, depending on how often you play. I recommend picking up these cheap Amazon Basics rechargeable AA batteries for a few bucks so you can keep reusing them. Each controller has a battery door that can be swapped out for any number of excellent controller accessories, like these AMVR controller grips, which add grip and help balance the controllers better with a handy hand strap. Quest 3S also supports what's called Inside-Out Body Tracking, which only a handful of games currently support. However, developers may start to use it more now that another Quest headset supports the feature. With this, in-game character movements will feel more realistic as the headset can properly align the virtual character's torso, shoulders, and arms with your actual movements in real life. Meta Quest 3S has also been outfitted with two IR illuminators on the front, positioned on the outside of each triple camera array on the front. This is a new feature for any Quest headset and allows the Quest 3S to see completely in the dark, provided you're in a small enough room. I tested different rooms at night with the lights off, and while tracking didn't work at all in my living room, it worked perfectly in any bedroom I tried it in. Essentially, as long as the Quest 3S can see walls, it will be able to track spatial movement in the dark. Likewise, hand tracking is better than ever—particularly in low light—than with any Quest headset to date. While I found daytime tracking performance and accuracy to be essentially identical to the more expensive Quest 3, Quest 3S can also track hands in the dark. That should help significantly in some dimly lit rooms when playing hand-tracked games or during casual entertainment when you're just using your hands to navigate the UI.  While you'll notice the controller differences and slimmer profile of the headset when unboxing it, nothing prepares you for the color mixed reality vision until you've tried it. It's not as clear as an Apple Vision Pro or even the Meta Quest 3 because of the lenses, but it's beyond just a generational upgrade from the Quest 2. If anything, it's like going from a 1950s black-and-white TV to a color HDTV. The Meta Quest 3S uses the same 4MP dual front-facing cameras as the Quest 3 and tends to look even brighter thanks to the lenses. Yes, Fresnel lenses aren't as crisp as the pancake lenses on Quest 3, but they allow more light in from the display giving it a distinctly brighter look. Because the lenses aren't as sharp and the display's resolution is lower, it's a bit harder to read text on a phone while wearing the headset, but this isn't a common mixed reality use case, anyway. Instead, you'll marvel at how fun games like Starship Home are. Mixed reality games allow you to turn your living room into a spaceship, defend against hordes of zombies in Drop Dead: The Cabin, or play a D&D-like board game together with other headset-wearing friends on your dining room table. When you're not viewing an augmented version of your real room, you'll be diving dungeons deep in Dungeons of Eternity, fighting bad guys in Batman Arkham Shadow, or just socializing on a Friday evening in Gorilla Tag or Orion Drift. There are thousands of games on the Meta Quest platform, and that number is growing every single month thanks to a new, more open marketplace and more VR players than ever. Of course, we maintain a list of the best Meta Quest games to give you a good starting point, and there are plenty of great ones to look forward to, like Skydance's Behemoth, Alien Rogue Incursion, Metro Awakening, and many more. All in all, Quest 3 games look a lot better than Quest 2 games, especially when they're Quest 3 exclusive. The Meta Quest 3S doesn't include a depth sensor like the Quest 3 has, but that doesn't seem to affect its mixed reality performance in my testing. As you can see in the video above, the Quest 3S is a little slower at mapping than the Quest 3 but not inordinately so. It took the Quest 3S roughly nine seconds longer to map my living room, but some of that time was because I ran into an early bug where hand tracking in some UI elements felt laggy. Realistically, it probably only took the Quest 3S around seven seconds longer to do the actual mapping, which is impressive given that it just uses cameras to do the work.  Meta's Horizon OS has been notably upgraded in its mixed reality capabilities since the launch of the Quest 3 last year, including automatic room mapping and object identification that makes mixed reality effortless. Additionally, a new mixed reality button on the bottom of the Quest 3S makes it effortless to jump between virtual reality and mixed reality. It's a substantial upgrade from all prior Meta Quest headsets which required you to perform an awkward and extremely unreliable double-tap on the side of the headset.  Because the VR gaming industry is relatively small compared to traditional consoles, the Meta Quest 3S's closest competition is made up of Meta headsets. The Quest 3S replaces the Quest 2 as the new standard in affordable VR. Its processor is 100% more powerful than the Quest 2, enabling it to play far richer and more detailed games and render impressive color mixed reality in your room. It's an easy recommendation to upgrade from a Quest 2 because of the price, but the full next-generation upgrade can be found in the Meta Quest 3. Compared to the Quest 3S, the Meta Quest 3 sports next-generation lenses with a 20-degree wider field of view (FoV), significantly enhanced clarity, a higher resolution display, and better contrast and colors than the Quest 3S. Surprisingly, Quest 3 doesn't include IR illuminators, so it can't play in the dark like Quest 3S. If you're a PCVR-only player, it would also make more sense to get a Quest 3 because of the enhanced clarity brought about by the lenses and display. Otherwise, if you prefer a headset with an OLED display or a much smaller headset, Bigscreen Beyond is your best bet.  You should buy if... You shouldn't buy if... The Meta Quest 3S is a triumph in every regard. It's an unbelievable bargain at $299, yet it still exhibits the best mixed reality and virtual reality gaming available today. The only real compromises are the lenses and display, which are worse than the Quest 3 but not detrimentally so. If I had to compare the experience to more traditional gaming specs, I'd say it's similar to the difference between a 1080p and 4K setup. Otherwise, the Meta Quest 3S is everything you need in a VR and mixed-reality headset today. It not only offers the highest-quality standalone VR games available—including the incredible free pack-in Batman Arkham Shadow—but it also connects to any PC and can play PCVR games completely wirelessly. It's a win-win-win for anyone looking to get into VR or upgrade from an older headset. There are certainly reasons to choose a Quest 3 over a Quest 3S, but for most people, the price point and overall value of the Quest 3S make it a must-buy console this Holiday season.   Get next-generation virtual reality and mixed reality games and apps with the Meta Quest 3S, a surprisingly affordable headset with capabilities beyond your imagination.

Such is the case with the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11, which continues to provide an excellent overall experience for any device, not just in the ChromeOS world. Not only does it feel like Lenovo listened to its customers, for the most part, but it also sets the bar even higher for the competition. That being said, it's not absolutely perfect, as there are things that we would've liked to see done differently. But, none of those gripes are deal-breakers in any fashion.

Find out more about how we test. In a world where value is king and functionality is secondary, Lenovo's Chromebook Duet series has reigned supreme for years. It all started with the original Duet back in 2020, before it was refreshed in 2022. Keeping with the two-year cadence, there's a new Duet in town with the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11. It comes as little surprise that Lenovo released a refreshed version of the Chromebook Duet. Not only has it been two years since the previous iteration, but, I was interested to see what kind of improvements Lenovo would make. More importantly, Google shared that the Duet is the \"best-selling Chromebook of all time.\" So in order to keep that train moving, a new version was inevitable. I was fortunate enough to spend some time with this new Chromebook tablet as part of Google's Chromebook Fall Event. At which point I came away feeling as though Lenovo has mostly hit its stride in this form factor. After spending more time with it for this review, I still largely feel the same, but with a few caveats that you should keep in mind.  The Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11 was announced alongside the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus on October 1, 2024. There are two models available for order, with a 4GB/64GB model and an 8GB/128GB version. Pricing for the former comes in at $339, while the latter comes in at $399. As an added bonus, whichever variant you decide to go with, Lenovo includes the Folio Keyboard with stand and the Lenovo USI Pen 2. This might not be the case with every retailer, but it should be available at many of them.  Before we take a look at the Duet 11 itself, it's important to talk about something that I'm extremely happy about. In my hands-on, I said, \"I can't help but feel as though Lenovo missed an opportunity by not including the stylus in the box.\" It turns out that this isn't the case, as Lenovo is including both the Folio Keyboard with Stand and the Lenovo USI Pen 2 in the box. This makes me happy because it means that you'll get everything you need to start using the Duet 11, without making separate purchases. When Lenovo released the IdeaPad Duet 3, the biggest upgrade came in the form of an incredibly improved display. Thankfully, Lenovo didn't really try to make too many differences with the Duet 11, as it still sports a 10.95-inch 2K screen. While my aging eyes aren't what they once were, it's still a joy being able to adjust the display and text size to fit more on the screen, while providing a crisp screen. Speaking of the screen, Google explained that the palm-rejection has been improved at the OS level. It's not really something that can be measured, but I have enjoyed using the Duet 11 as a digital notebook. Most of the time, it's right next to my mouse, so I can start jotting down notes whenever I need. I've used my fair share of USI pens over the years, but I did notice something about the Lenovo USI Pen 2 that's included with the Duet 11. I thought something was different compared to the last one that I bought, and after digging in my desk drawer, it turned out that I was right.  There's nothing functionally different than before, but Lenovo ditched the pen cap-like design with the clip on the end. Instead, it's more similar to the Penoval USI 2.0 Pen, with the exception of the replaceable AAAA battery. I'm not much of an artist, outside of just drawing stick figures, but I have mostly enjoyed using the Duet 11 paired with GoodNotes. It's still not as smooth compared to using Samsung's S Pen with the Galaxy Tab, or the Apple Pencil with an iPad. But it's really just a solid experience, and I doubt you'll run into any issues. As a tablet, the Duet 11 feels just like any other 11-inch tablet that I've used over the past couple of years. If Lenovo was aiming to create a premium device, the company definitely nailed it. Although hefty, you won't find anything that feels cheap when holding and using the tablet. This extends to the physical webcam switch found on the top, which happens to also be another change over last year's model. There's an attention to detail here that I really didn't expect, but I guess that's what happens when a device reaches its third generation.  One of the biggest upgrades I was hoping for out of a new Chromebook Duet would be an updated processor. Not just because the Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 is getting long in the tooth, but we need a bit more \"oomph\" with all of the AI features being implemented into ChromeOS. For the most part, the Dimensity 838 seems to deliver, a chip that was introduced in May 2024. Along with simply being more powerful than the Snapdragon 7c Gen 2, the Kompanio 838 also has an \"AI-enabled NPU,\" which should mean that the Duet 11 shouldn't struggle when you're using the on-device Gemini AI features. I'm also a fan of the new \"Welcome Recap\" feature that appears whenever I wake the Duet 11 from sleep. Although I don't use it all of the time, I enjoy having the option to either pick up from where I left off or get the day started with a clean slate. It's important to point out that although the Welcome Recap feature was announced alongside the Duet 11, it's not limited to the Duet, and is coming to all Chromebook owners.  So far, I've been pretty darn positive on the Chromebook Duet 11, and for good reason. However, it's not been all sunshine and rainbows, Since I kind of left off with performance in the last section, I'll touch on a couple of things that stuck out. I'm not entirely sure if it's just a \"me\" thing, but I can't help but feel like the cursor isn't as smooth as it should be. There seems to be the slightest bit of stutter, regardless of whether I'm using the trackpad that's built into the keyboard case or a Bluetooth mouse. It could have something to do with being on the ChromeOS Beta Channel, but I've already tried to Powerwash it for a different reason, and the stutter is still there. Another problem that I ran into was that the Duet 11 just completely froze while I was working on this review. There were about 10-15 Chrome tabs open, on one side of the window, with the Obsidian app open on the other. I was going back and forth between the different tabs and then tried to open the Slack PWA only to end up with a frozen screen. The weird thing was that after I left Panera and got home, I grabbed the Duet 11 out of my bag, opened it up, and everything was still right where it was.  While that might seem like a lot going on all at the same time, there's really no excuse as the model I'm using is equipped with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. There shouldn't have been any bottle-necking to speak of, but that leaves me a bit worried about Duet 11 with 4GB of RAM. Having multiple configurations of a Chromebook is great, and I completely understand that the 4GB/64GB model should be sufficient for many. But is that really going to be the case a few years from now? Frankly, I would have liked to see the 8GB/128GB version as the starting point, and then either an 8GB/256GB or even a 16GB/256GB variant. This isn't something directed solely at Lenovo, as there are plenty of Chromebooks out there with just 4GB of RAM. We already know how popular Chromebooks are in classrooms, so perhaps reserve the lower-end models for deals Google makes with school districts. In relation to the Duet 11, I can't help but feel like it takes away from the premium hardware experience. Even with the 8GB Chromebook Duet 11, you might find yourself bumping up against the 128GB limit. There are ways to work around this, but not everyone has fast internet speeds to take advantage of cloud storage solutions such as Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive. Of course, there's also the option of relying on a portable SSD or hard drive, and while that's convenient, it doesn't help if you left it behind and you need an important file.  This could have been solved by implementing a microSD card slot, and it's not like there isn't room in the chassis. Not only did Lenovo add a 3.5mm headphone jack, but there is also the physical webcam switch on the top. At the end of the day, it feels like a missed opportunity, even if some companies are trying to phase out expandable storage. Lastly, it's a bit disappointing to see another new Chromebook released in 2024 without some form of biometrics. There are a variety of ways that ChromeOS attempts to keep unwanted people from using your Chromebook, but all it takes is just one time for the walls to come crashing down.  As I've mentioned a few times here, there's not much standing in Lenovo's way when it comes to Chromebook tablets. The ASUS Chromebook Detachable CM3001 is the most recent contender and is almost $100 cheaper. However, it also has some rather thick bezels and isn't nearly as powerful with the Kompanio 520 at the helm. Your next best bet would be to get either the Chromebook Duet 3 or the Duet 5, despite these being a bit older. And if you like the idea of a ChromeOS tablet, but want a larger screen, then the Duet 5 is still your only choice. We were hoping to see a successor to Lenovo's larger Chromebook tablet, but I guess it just isn't in the cards. The number of alternatives quickly begins to grow, provided that you're okay with a more traditional design. Acer's Chromebook Plus 515 costs the same amount as the higher-end Duet 11, coming in at $399. But thanks to the Intel Core i3, you'll enjoy all of the new and upcoming Chromebook Plus features that won't be available on the Duet 11.  You should buy this if: You shouldn't buy this if: There's no such thing as the perfect device, but it feels as though Lenovo is getting closer and closer to creating the perfect Chromebook tablet. The original Duet provided a solid foundation, and it was one that Lenovo has just been building on since then. The Chromebook Duet 11 is a great example of when a company makes meaningful improvements, listens to feedback, and implements changes in the \"right\" way. Sure, there are gripes and complaints to be had, but in reality, I fully expect this new model to sell just as well as its predecessors. It also wouldn't surprise me if it flies off of the shelves as soon as the first round of discounts arrives. I can (and will) wholeheartedly recommend the Duet 11 to anyone who asks, with one caveat — pay the extra $40 so you can get double the RAM and storage. We don't know what the future holds, but I would venture to guess that it won't be too long before performance takes a hit with the entry-level version.   It's incredible, if you get the right one There are two models of the Chromebook Duet 11, but only one of them should be on your radar. The entry-level 4GB/64GB variant will probably start to feel a bit sluggish much sooner than the 8GB/128GB model. So just spring for the extra $40 and thank yourself later.

Find out more about how we test. The competition for control over your TV has heated up in recent years, as Amazon, Roku, and even Walmart offer a variety of options. It has been four years since Google announced a \"flagship\" streaming device, the Chromecast with Google TV (4K). Now, Google is trying to work its way back into the fight with the all-new Google TV Streamer. Instead of the plug-and-play solution that the Chromecast and Fire TV Stick offer, Google opted for a completely different approach. Part of this is due to Google attempting to improve its image while also trying to provide a more premium experience for its customers.  The Google TV Streamer was announced and made available for pre-order on August 6 alongside the Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen). It was subsequently released on September 24, coming in either Hazel or Porcelain, and retails for $99.99. You can currently purchase the TV Streamer from a variety of retailers, including Best Buy, Target, and others, or directly from Google.  No matter how you look at it, the Google TV Streamer is a sleek and well-designed device. It sports the same soft-touch finish found on the Chromecast, which extends to the color-matched (and new) Voice Remote. Since this isn't just a dongle that hangs out of sight, it was important to provide a sleek design that won't stick out like a sore thumb. I think that Google nailed it here, as the TV Streamer has looked pretty darn great in both my home office and on the TV stand in my living room.  I'm also a big fan of the trio of ports found on the back. We have a Gigabit Ethernet jack, along with HDMI 2.1, and the USB-C port provides both data and power, which is rather important. There's also a small button that can be used to find your remote, another benefit of the TV Streamer. I've only had to use this once so far, but it was nice not needing to lift up my couch in a frantic search after my son decided to put it in his bin of toys. In general, I don't really have much to say about the actual Google TV experience from a streaming standpoint. Almost all of my streaming apps are available, and with the upgraded 32GB of storage, I can sideload apps without much worry. So far, my favorite feature of the TV Streamer has been the various smart home implementations that have been made. The Home Panel has been a dream, letting me turn off lights in a room, lock the front door, or adjust the thermostat without needing to get up. As such, I was excited to swap out my Ring Doorbell for the Nest Doorbell, only to find out that something happened to the Nest, making it unusable. Even still, I can also keep an eye on my dog while she's lounging on the porch courtesy of the Nest Cam mounted on the back corner of my house. All of that is great, especially for my wife, but the TV Streamer brings two things in particular that are more exciting to me — Matter and Thread support. More specifically, the TV Streamer doubles as a Thread border router, so I don't need to worry about getting OEM-specific accessories when I want to upgrade my smart home gear. Technically, you can add the TV Streamer to Apple HomeKit, but I don't recommend it. A surprising discovery was that I could even add the TV Streamer to the Apple Home app. But it doesn't show up or operate as a streaming device, instead appearing as a series of switches. So while we're one step closer to the dream, it's obvious that we aren't there just yet. Now onto a rather niche use case.  Something I rather enjoy doing with my streaming devices is attempting to turn them into retro gaming boxes. The easy part is getting RetroArch installed and set up, but storage has almost always been the Achilles heel. The 32GB of storage on the Google TV Streamer is plenty for the majority of people, but I wanted more. They say that the third time's the charm, as that's how many different USB-C hubs I had to try before finding one that would recognize my thumb drive. The Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub is definitely overkill for the situation, but since it was the first one that worked, it's the one I've stuck with. Although I'll probably try and find a different one so that I can put this back in my backpack.  After plugging the USB-A thumb drive into the Dockcase USB-C Hub and plugging that into the TV Streamer, everything worked just as you'd expect. The 64GB of extra storage was immediately recognized, so I fired up RetroArch and started messing around. For the most part, this offers decent performance, but there have been a few hiccups that I'll cover a bit later. Nevertheless, I can't get over how much fun it is being able to fire up RetroArch with my Stadia controller and play those classic retro games.  Here's something I don't understand — why is Google, or any company for that matter, using a processor that's more than three years old? That's exactly what we have in the TV Streamer, as it's powered by MediaTek's MT8696. This just so happens to be the same SoC found in Amazon's Fire TV Stick 4K Max from 2021. The same one that was replaced by a faster model about a year ago. To be clear, the only hiccups in performance that I've seen have been with trying to mess around with RetroArch and different emulators. However, there's no way this is going to be able to still be this snappy a few years down the road. I really would've liked to see Google stop this \"glass half-full\" approach that we've seen in various devices over the years. Part of the reason I don't really have much to say about the interface is that it's not all that great. Sure, it gives me some pretty solid recommendations while putting my installed apps near the top. But that's about where it starts to fall short for me.  Despite having the app set up and installed, the only options shown within the \"Live\" tab are for Google's Freeplay service. That's great and all, but why can't I access the channels from the streaming service I want? It's not like Google isn't aware of the other streaming services out there, so let me connect and use the pay that I pay for. Maybe the onus is on the streaming service, and not Google, but I have a feeling that's not the case considering there's no settings panel that lets you connect to other live TV services. Another potential issue feels more like an oversight. You just picked up the TV Streamer, and you're excited to get it all set up and everything. You tear the box apart, go to plug everything in, and realize that you're missing something—the HDMI cable. That's because Google doesn't include one in the box but will sell you an \"Ultra High-Speed\" cable for another $20. Of course, this doesn't help much now that you already have the TV Streamer without a cable to connect it to your TV.  Google is attempting to semi-rectify the situation by offering a $10 discount code if you pre-ordered the TV Streamer. However, this only applies to pre-ordered units, and the \"deal\" will expire at the end of November. There's a good chance that you have an HDMI cable lying around, but the point is that it's something Google should have included in the box. My last gripe has to do with game streaming apps, and how few of them are actually available. Xbox Game Pass, PS Remote Play, and Amazon Luna are nowhere to be found. When trying to download them from the Play Store website on my PC, the Streamer is greyed out and says \"This item is not compatible with your device.\"  I have no earthly idea what's happening here, but this isn't it. Sure, GeForce Now and Steam Link show up, which is great. But we should also be able to use the others, and I wish we knew why this isn't the case. Maybe Google is playing \"keep away\" after Game Pass landed on the Fire TV earlier this year. Whatever the reason, it's time for these tactics to stop because, at the end of the day, you're only hurting the people who end up buying your products.  The Apple TV 4K (3rd Gen) includes double the storage (64GB vs. 32GB), a more powerful processor (A15 Bionic), and an excellent streaming experience for about $30 more than the TV Streamer. However, the base model lacks an Ethernet port, nor does it double as a Thread border router. If those features matter to you, then you'll be looking at $149 for the Wi-Fi + Ethernet Apple TV. More recently, Roku released its most powerful streaming device yet, with the Roku Ultra 2024. The company claims it's \"more than 30% faster than other Roku players,\" along with upgrading to Wi-Fi 6 and HDMI 2.1. There's smart home connectivity too, however, it appears that the integration is only available if you make use of Roku's growing lineup of smart home devices. Rounding out the pack is Amazon. Currently, you won't find a Fire TV device at the same price as the TV Streamer, as the Fire TV Stick 4K Max retails for $60, while the Cube comes in at $140. It's a surprising \"hole\" in Amazon's lineup, so we wonder if Amazon might end up introducing something to go toe-to-toe with the TV Streamer in the future.  You should buy this if… You shouldn't buy this if… When it comes to whether I would recommend the TV Streamer, I'm kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place. For me, it's a no-brainer, as the ads aren't as annoying, I'm comfortable with side-loading apps, and the Streamer features Matter and Thread support. These are some of the things that I care about, in addition to offering seamless integration into my Google-focused smart home. On the other hand, it's not as powerful as I feel it should be at this price. It doesn't help that the Streamer uses a less performant SoC than the latest Fire TV Stick 4K Max, which costs $40 less. Do I think Google missed the mark with pricing? Not in the slightest, but I do think corners were cut for the sake of margins, and it's just disappointing. That being said, I've really enjoyed using the TV Streamer, and I'm already planning on picking up another one so I can stop moving this one back and forth between my home office and living room. I only hope that with a bit more RAM and storage wiggle room, Google can continue to improve the experience.   Different, in a good way It's not without its flaws, but the Google TV Streamer is a rather interesting piece of hardware, and one that should flourish much more than the device its replacing.

Not only is it extremely powerful thanks to the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2, but there are more bells and whistles than you can imagine.

Find out more about how we test. After what felt like an eternity, the Ayaneo Pocket S was finally released, aiming to redefine the premium Android gaming space. Part of the problem was that it was announced in December 2023, and you couldn't even buy one until April 2024. Fast forward to now, and the Pocket S remains one of the most powerful handhelds that money can buy. It seems that very few corners were cut in order to keep you gaming for hours and hours. From the borderless display to the industrial design and all of the power offered by the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2, the Pocket S could be everything you ever wanted.  There's a lot to like about what this handheld has to offer, but it's not the perfect experience, if there is such a thing. So without further adieu, let's dive into the Pocket S and see what it's really made of.   After being announced in December 2023, the Ayaneo Pocket S launched on Indiegogo in April 2024 before it began shipping in June 2024. As of September 2024, the Pocket S can now be purchased directly from Ayaneo. There are three different RAM and storage configurations to choose from, along with two color options. Pricing starts at $509 for the base model with 12GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, while the \"Unmarked Edition\" will set you back $749.  Something I've come to appreciate as I've grown older is the feeling of a premium device. Having used several Ayaneo products in the past, this is clearly an area of focus for the company, and it's immediately apparent with the Pocket S. This Android handheld is made from a combination of aluminum, glass, and a smidge of plastic. As a result, it provides a nice hefty feeling in the hand, letting me know that it won't break if I get frustrated while playing games. While the all-glass front panel is surely prone to glare, it still looks incredibly stunning. Much of this is helped by the borderless 6-inch screen, available in either 1080p or 1440p. Luckily, my Pocket S is the latter, with my games looking about as good as it gets from an IPS display. It's pretty obvious that Ayaneo practically went all-out with the Pocket S, as it's packed with bells and whistles. This thing has everything from a microSD card slot to a power button that doubles as a fingerprint scanner and almost everything in between. There's even a hardware switch on the side that lets you quickly activate the different performance modes. Speaking of performance, let's talk about what the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2 has to offer. The configuration I have pairs the G3x Gen 2 with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, offering one of the most powerful Android devices out there. Because the G3x Gen 2 is basically a slightly overclocked version of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, you can expect slightly better performance. When it comes to emulation, the Pocket S is simply a beast. It's capable of handling up to Switch-level games and even some Windows emulation via Winlator, mostly without breaking a sweat. Thanks to the reliance on a Snapdragon chip, there aren't as many issues with emulating more powerful systems. However, you'll still want to play around with the settings and try out different drivers if you're running into any issues. As you'd suspect, the Pocket S performs incredibly well, even if you stick to the confines of the Google Play Store. There were some hiccups at launch, as there were reports that many couldn't play COD: Warzone Mobile for one reason or another. Thankfully, that's no longer a problem, but this is the one game that the Pocket S struggled with. Frames were inconsistent and choppy and the image quality looked like it was straight out of the early 2010s. So while I was happy that I could jump into a match, and didn't need to even remap the touchscreen controls, I do hope that this is just a symptom of a recent update. Speaking of mapping controls, there are some games on the Play Store that simply don't want to work with a controller. This is even the case if you're trying to play a game from your phone or tablet with something like an Xbox or DualSense controller. Somehow, Ayaneo managed to workaround this with its implementation of \"No Feeling\" button mapping. All you need to do is slide out the AYASpace overlay from the right, then enable Key Mapping under the Controller section. Then, follow the on-screen guide to map the touchscreen controls to the physical controls on the Pocket S. This should work for pretty much any game that you download, but your mileage may vary.  One of the biggest problems that I have with many handhelds and controllers is that some of them are just too uncomfortable. It could be the most powerful Android gaming handheld ever, with all of the bells and whistles, but that experience could be ruined within minutes if my hands start to cramp. Unfortunately, it's something I had to deal with when using the Pocket S when it first arrived. Don't get me wrong; it's a beautifully designed handheld that is as premium as can be, but the flat edges and lack of curves just really don't let me enjoy playing games for more than 30-45 minutes at a time.  Surprisingly enough, Ayaneo has a \"fix\" for this, but it's one that you can't actually buy from the company's website. When the Pocket S Indiegogo campaign launched, Ayaneo also introduced a line of accessories, which included both an \"Ergonomic Case\" and a \"2-in-1 Ergonomic Case.\" This is basically just a plastic shell with a matte finish that attaches to the handheld. Instead of needing to take it out of a sleeve or bag, the Ergonomic Case is designed to remain attached to the Pocket S all of the time. At the same time, it makes it feel more like you're holding a controller, as opposed to just a slab of glass and aluminum.  Thankfully, I received this a couple of days after the Pocket S arrived, and that's mostly where it's stayed. However, others aren't so lucky, as it's surprisingly not available on the Ayaneo website. You can find it on AliExpress, but I think it would have been a better move to just include it in the box.  Ayaneo's Ergonomic Case might be a \"must-have\" if you have concerns about hand cramps.  It's not the most perfect or elegant solution, as you aren't able to access the aforementioned performance switch on the right side or the microSD card slot on the left. With the former, you can still toggle between performance modes via the software, and I'd recommend just tossing your microSD card in there first before attaching the case. Another issue that I have is the cost. A starting price of a touch over $500 could be a tough pill to swallow for everyone. At this tier, the Pocket S includes 12GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, which might seem like plenty, but there's more to it than that. For just $40 more, you can get a much more powerful Steam Deck OLED or ROG Ally.  While being able to play Windows games on an Android gaming handheld is great, it does require a bit more than just tapping the \"Download\" button in the Play Store. Meanwhile, the Steam Deck is well-optimized for playing almost everything, and the ROG Ally is just a portable Windows computer. Not to mention that the Steam Deck OLED has an OLED display with a faster refresh rate, along with the ability to physically upgrade the storage while also including a microSD card slot. It's an argument that I really try not to think too much about with the variety of Android handhelds. Still, it's difficult not to, especially when you have a handheld like the Pocket S, which becomes more expensive than the Steam Deck OLED just by bumping up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. A couple of smaller gripes that I have with the Ayaneo Pocket S is that I really would've liked to see either an OLED display or an IPS screen with a faster refresh rate. Funnily enough, Ayaneo is already rectifying those complaints with another handheld that's slated to arrive later this year with the Pocket EVO.  In the realm of Android gaming handhelds, it's really just been a two-horse race, as we've yet to see a refresh of the Razer Edge. Instead, Ayaneo and AYN have been trading blows, each offering something a bit different from the other. AYN exploded onto the Android gaming scene with the Odin 2, which remains one of the most popular handhelds on the market. It's powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and is much more ergonomic while also being more affordable. The 16GB/512GB Odin 2 can be had for $459, whereas this same configuration will cost you more than $600 with the Pocket S. Earlier this year, AYN surprised many as it introduced another option in the Odin 2 lineup with the Odin 2 Mini. It trades the LCD panel from the Odin 2 for a miniLED display, while also looking like a PS Vita if it were released in 2024. Performance is also handled by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, and it's priced even more affordably, coming in at either $339 or $399.  As I mentioned previously, Ayaneo has already announced a handheld that looks to solve a few of my concerns, as the Pocket EVO is slated to arrive before the end of the year. It shares much of the internal DNA from the Pocket S, but in a much more ergonomic, and sports an OLED display with a 165Hz refresh rate. The Indiegogo campaign is currently ongoing, with the price starting at $389 for 8GB/128GB and going up to $645 if you want the \"RetroPower\" model with 24GB of RAM and 1TB of internal storage. Not to be outdone, AYN recently announced its latest handheld, the Odin 2 Portal, and the Indiegogo campaign is officially underway. The Portal features a 7-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and still relies on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for power. Three configurations are available, with Early Bird pricing starting at $329 and topping out at $499.  You should buy this if... You shouldn't buy this if... Although I have issues and concerns with the Ayaneo Pocket S, I still can't deny how fantastic it's been to use. The bigger problem is managing to find the time so that I can jump into a game for more than just a couple of minutes. If it weren't for the Pocket EVO and Odin 2 Portal slated to arrive within the next month or two, I'd feel pretty comfortable recommending the Pocket S. It's powerful and sleek, and Ayaneo continues to improve the software experience with useful features. I will admit, however, that the launcher leaves a lot to be desired, but that's remedied with the help of ES-DE for Android. With that being said, if you don't want to wait for the EVO or the Portal, then I'd definitely recommend grabbing the Pocket S. It's got almost everything you could want from a dedicated gaming Android handheld. Just be prepared to empty your wallet to get one.   The definition of premium Android gaming Ayaneo's Pocket S manages to pack an incredible punch in one of the sleekest designs that we've seen. It'll set you back a pretty penny, and as long as you don't want an x86 handheld, it's worth every cent.  Andrew Myrick is a Senior Editor at Android Central.

Throughout their trip, Cook has been active on Weibo. Cook and Williams met students from China Agricultural University and Zhejiang University, exploring how they use iPhones and iPads to improve sustainable agricultural practices. Cook thanked the China Rural Development Fund (CFRD) and everyone involved in the Science and Technology Backyards initiative for their work in promoting efficiency and sustainability in farming. They also met renowned Chinese fashion photographer Chen Man, who captured images of Cook using the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Cook spent time with musician Lexie Liu, who shared insights into her creative process and how she uses Apple products, including the iPhone and Mac. Cook and Williams also visited developers at Gala Sports, where they witnessed a demonstration of the game NBA Rivals on the iPhone 16. A significant aspect of Cook's trip was the announcement of Apple's support for a national parks initiative in China through a partnership with the China Green Carbon Foundation (CGCF). The visit marks Cook's second trip to China in 2024, following a visit in March, which included the opening of Apple's 57th store in the Greater China region and meetings with key suppliers.  Simultaneously, Apple's Senior Vice President Worldwide Marketing Greg Jozwiak is visiting Europe. Get weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.

Prime members will be able to subscribe to Apple TV+ for $9.99 per month directly within the Prime Video app. The partnership potentially allows Apple's streaming service to reach a wider audience through Amazon's popular Prime Video platform, thereby avoiding the need to download additional apps or navigate separate billing systems. Subscribers will have access to Apple TV+'s full catalog of original content, including hit shows like \"Severance,\" \"Ted Lasso,\" and \"The Morning Show,\" as well as films and live sports events. Mike Hopkins, senior VP of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, described the move as part of Amazon's strategy to expand Prime Video's offerings and allow customers to \"personalize their streaming experience within a single app.\" Apple's senior VP of services Eddy Cue was also quoted in Amazon's press release:\n \"We want to make Apple TV+ and its award-winning library of series and films from the world's greatest storytellers available to as many viewers as possible. We're thrilled that Prime Video will now offer Apple TV+, giving viewers an incredible breadth of viewing options.\" The arrangement mirrors Apple's own strategy of offering third-party video subscriptions through its Apple TV Channels feature, though Prime Video is not currently available as an Apple TV Channel. While Apple TV+ is already accessible on various platforms, including smart TVs and streaming devices, this partnership may simplify the subscription process for Prime Video users who were previously unfamiliar with how to access Apple TV+. The companies have not disclosed specific details about their business arrangement, but it's clearly mutually beneficial. Apple gains increased visibility and potential subscriber growth, while Amazon enhances its content offerings within the Prime Video ecosystem. Get weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.

When photographing anything dynamic like sports events, wildlife, or children at play, burst mode increases the likelihood of obtaining sharp, well-timed images. By taking multiple shots in quick succession, you can select the best frame where the subject's motion is perfectly frozen. Here's how to shoot Burst mode photos on iPhone.\n  When shooting in Burst mode, notice how the counter increases in the shutter's original position for as long as you hold it down. This indicates how many shots are being captured in the current burst.  Apple also includes an option in iOS settings that when enabled lets you press and hold the Volume Up button to take Burst shots. Go to Settings  ➝ Camera, then turn on Use Volume Up for Burst.\n  When you take a series of burst photos, they automatically appear in the Photos app under the Album name \"Bursts.\" You'll also find them in the Recent Days section.

The 17-minute movie is set in World War II, and it follows a group of sailors that are struggling to survive a deadly torpedo attack. Submerged was directed by Austrian filmmaker Edward Berger, who also directed 2022 movie All Quiet on the Western Front. Apple shared a behind the scenes video on the making of Submerged, showing off the full-scale 23-ton submarine set that was used for filming. Submerged, like other Apple Immersive Video content, features high-resolution 3D video that's meant to be viewed on the Vision Pro, and it is meant to make the wearer feel like they are part of the action. Spatial Audio is included for a more immersive experience.\n \"Apple Immersive Video allows Apple Vision Pro users around the world to experience the next generation of sports, documentaries, and music performances. With Submerged, an immersive film from visionary director Edward Berger, we're excited to premiere the next generation of narrative filmmaking,\" said Tor Myhren, Apple's vice president of Marketing Communications. \"Vision Pro places you in the middle of the story -- inside a densely packed submarine, shoulder to shoulder with its crew. That deep sense of immersion just wasn't possible before, and we can't wait to see how it inspires filmmakers to push the boundaries of visual storytelling.\" In addition to introducing Submerged, Apple also highlighted additional Apple Immersive Video content coming in the next few months. Next Friday, Apple plans to release an immersive short film featuring the 2024 NBA All-Star Weekend, and in November, Apple will team up with The Weeknd for an immersive music experience celebrating his new album, Hurry Up Tomorrow. In December, Apple will release the next episode of its Adventure series. \"Ice Dive\" will follow freediver Ant Williams as he attempts his best record for the longest distance dive under ice with a single breath. Adventure will continue in early 2025 in Majorca, Spain, with sport climber Kai Lightner. A new series called Concert for One will also come before the end of 2024, and it will feature intimate performances from some of the world's biggest artists. The first episode will feature British singer-songwriter RAYE. The next episode of the Elevated series will come in early 2025, and it will feature a crisp autumn in New England, with an aerial journey along winding coastlines and rivers. Apple Vision Pro is available in Australia, Canada, China mainland, Hong Kong, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, the U.K., and the U.S. All Apple Immersive Video is available at no additional cost and it can be viewed in the Apple TV app in most countries. In China, the video content can be watched in the Migu Video and Tencent Video apps. Get weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.

I Tried It The rules are pretty much the same as the regular game. You're given 16 words and asked to put them into four groups that are somehow connected. The main difference is that all the words and categories have some kind of sports tie-in. Sometimes the categories seem obvious, but the game attempts to trick you by using sports-related words that can fit into more than one group. And the four groups of words have different difficulty levels. Yellow is the easiest and purple the hardest, but you won't know which color group is which until you solve the puzzle. You don't have to be a sports obsessive to solve Connections: Sports Edition, but it helps to know a little bit about a bunch of different sports and athletes. The words might include player names, team names or sport-related activities. Here are four hints for the groupings in today's Connections: Sports Edition puzzle, ranked from the easiest, yellow group to the tough (and sometimes bizarre) purple group. Yellow group hint: Beantown icons. Green group hint: Not western teams. Blue group hint: Splish-splash. Purple group hint: Tops in the draft. Yellow group: Boston sports icons. Green group: AL East cities. Blue group: Gold-medal swimmers in Paris. Purple group: Recent WNBA No. 1 picks.

Reviews ethics statement \n    From NBA League Pass to ESPN, TNT, FanDuel Sports Networks and more, you can catch every game during the 2024-25 NBA season without cable from opening night through to the NBA Finals.\n   Basketball is back. After another busy offseason that saw trades of all-stars like Karl-Anthony Towns as recently as earlier this month, it's time for action to go from the Twittersphere to the actual hardwood. The 82-game marathon regular season begins on Tuesday night, runs through the holidays, Christmas Day games and All-Star weekend in February 2025, and concludes in April. The NBA playoffs start their mini-marathon in April and conclude sometime in June with the NBA Finals.  The in-season tournament is back for its second year with teams competing for the NBA Cup. The tournament games start on Nov. 12 and end with a championship game -- the only one that doesn't count toward the regular season standings -- on Dec. 17.  That's a lot of awesome basketball, and NBA fans looking to stream their team throughout the year will need access to a few different services to catch every game. In addition to your regular regional sports network -- the local channel that carries your team's games week in and week out -- you'll also need ABC, ESPN, TNT and NBA TV for nationally televised contests.  The NBA's new media deals, which will see Amazon's Prime Video and NBC/Peacock replace TNT, start next year for the 2025-26 season. Yes, TNT still has the NBA this season.  All out-of-market games will continue to air on NBA League Pass, which is a great choice if you follow a team in a different city from where you live. Getting the service for the full season (with the NBA TV channel included) costs $110, while a \"Premium\" option that includes in-arena feeds in place of commercials and the ability to watch three games at once runs $160 for the season. It's important to note that local fans aren't able to watch their team play on League Pass, as broadcasts of these contests air exclusively on regional sports networks. National games are similarly blacked out. While you absolutely don't need cable to watch basketball this year, it still might be the easiest and cheapest choice depending on where you live. Read more: How to Watch NFL Games With or Without Cable in 2024 Jayson Tatum and the Boston Celtics will look to repeat as champions after winning it all last season.  As usual, die-hard sports fans are beholden to regional sports networks that carry the majority of the games for their local team(s). Examples include MSG in the New York area and Spectrum SportsNet in Los Angeles. These RSNs are usually included in local cable packages, so most cable subscribers never have to worry about gaining access to the broadcasts on these channels: They can simply turn on the TV and watch the game.  Cord-cutting basketball fans have a tougher path. Because of rights agreements, our favorite live TV streaming services like YouTube TV or Hulu with Live TV don't carry many RSNs. DirecTV Stream and Fubo are the exceptions; both offer numerous RSNs, including the FanDuel   Sports channels (formerly Ballys), but they're more expensive than other options. Fubo also still lacks TNT.  Ultimately, depending on your location, getting a cable subscription that includes ESPN, ABC, TNT and the local RSN might actually be cheaper and easier than streaming -- especially if it's bundled with the home internet you'll likely be getting anyway. Read more: DirecTV Stream Review: Expensive, but the Best Option for Streaming NBA and NHL A Bally Sports San Diego microphone.  Diamond Sports Group, which owns what's now called FanDuel Sports Network (formerly known as the Bally Sports regional sports networks), has been dealing with bankruptcy filings, and it remains to be seen what this means for watching basketball on those RSNs this season. FanDuel Sports Network airs games for 13 teams, or close to half the league. For now, games will air on those stations as they always have, but the situation could change.  FanDuel Sports Networks' NBA teams include the Atlanta Hawks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Charlotte Hornets, Detroit Pistons, Indiana Pacers, Los Angeles Clippers, Memphis Grizzlies, Miami Heat, Milwaukee Bucks, Minnesota Timberwolves, Oklahoma City Thunder, Orlando Magic and San Antonio Spurs.  The Dallas Mavericks and New Orleans Pelicans were on FanDuel Sports Network last year, but both have now gone on their own and will make their local games available for free over-the-air (with an antenna).  Read more: Our picks for the best antennas in 2024 The Chicago Bulls also have a new home, with games this season airing on a newly created Chicago Sports Network instead of NBC Sports Chicago. Right now the channel requires a cable or satellite package with a free over-the-air antenna option only available in certain areas (with more promised to be coming soon).  The Phoenix Suns (formerly on Bally Sports) and Utah Jazz (previously on AT&T SportsNet) already announced new partners last year and both have led the charge in making their games available for free with an antenna.  The Houston Rockets (formerly on AT&T SportsNet), meanwhile, are now on Space City Home Network, which the team created in partnership with baseball's Houston Astros after the clubs acquired their local SportsNet channel from Warner Bros. Discovery.  In addition to making their games available locally over-the-air, the Suns and Jazz have also launched new streaming services for those looking to stream in-market. The Suns' streaming service will run $100 for the season (through a \"limited time\" offer, the monthly cost remains $15), while the Jazz's service will run $125.50 for the year (or $20 per month if paying monthly). A Jazz option that also includes the new Utah Hockey Club's NHL games is $175 for the season.  They aren't alone either. Other teams offering their own in-market streaming options include the Portland Trail Blazers (BlazerVision, $120 for the season), Los Angeles Lakers (Spectrum SportsNet Plus, $20 monthly, $195 annually), Los Angeles Clippers (ClipperVision, $20 monthly or $125 for the season) and Washington Wizards (Monumental Sports Network, $20 monthly or $200 annually).  The Brooklyn Nets (YES Network, $20 monthly or $240 annually) and New York Knicks (MSG Plus, $30 monthly, $280 annually) have teamed up on a new joint venture for New York teams called Gotham Sports. This lets you get either team individually or as a bundle together ($320 annually or $42 monthly). The YES Network airs Nets and MLB's Yankees games while MSG Plus has the Knicks plus the NHL's Rangers, Islanders and Devils.  For those who still have teams with FanDuel Sports Network, you can actually get the channel without subscribing to cable. The streaming service offers users in its coverage area a way to stream just the FanDuel Sports Network channels. The service generally costs $20 a month or around $190 a year for your local FanDuel   Sports channel, including NBA and NHL games (plus MLB games in certain areas). In markets where you normally have two different FanDuel   Sports channels, you can choose to only buy one or you can bundle them together for $30 a month.  While the normal pricing is $190 annually, the service is currently offering an option to sign up for a full season in certain markets at $108 for a \"season pass.\"  FanDuel Sports Plus uses your billing ZIP code to determine which channels are available to you, though you'll be able to log into your channels from anywhere in the country. You can check your options at FanDuel Sports Network's website here.  It is worth noting that this option does not include national games like the ones that are broadcast on ABC, ESPN or TNT.  This service is only available for those whose billing ZIP code falls in locations covered by FanDuel Sports Network channels. Users can pay $20 a month or $190 a year for streaming access to their local FanDuel Sports Network channel without cable ($125 if you want just through the season). Those who live in areas covered by multiple   FanDuel Sports networks will be able to bundle them together for $25 or $30 a month or pick one network for $20. Multiview in the NBA app. For NBA fans looking to watch a lot of out-of-market basketball, a subscription to NBA League Pass has plenty to offer. You can get the whole NBA slate for $110 for the season, with commercials and one device, or $160 for the season for a \"Premium\" option that includes in-arena feeds instead of commercials and the ability to watch on three devices at once (though the price is up from $130 last year). There are some new features this year, including multiview which lets you watch multiple games at once in the NBA app.  Those interested in following only a single team can buy a Team Pass for $90 for the season. College students who are actively enrolled can get 40% off the monthly price of the regular League Pass (normally $15 per month).  The catch, of course, with any League Pass plan is \"out-of-market.\" Most fans are in-market, meaning they follow the local team, and unfortunately for them RSNs have broadcast exclusivity in the region that they cover. That means local NBA games are blacked out on NBA League Pass. If you're living in Los Angeles, for example, you won't be able to watch Lakers or Clippers games on NBA League Pass. The same goes for Knicks or Nets fans in New York, Bucks fans in Milwaukee and so on. The only way to watch most of those home team games in your home market is to get a service that has the local RSN, namely Spectrum SportsNet, FanDuel Sports Network SoCal, MSG Network, YES Network or FanDuel Sports Network Wisconsin.  Services like NBA League Pass use IP addresses to block out games in viewers' regions -- you'll just get a black screen or message telling you it's unavailable if you try to watch those games. That's why League Pass is ideal for those who want to follow one or more of the teams based in cities other than their own, aka out-of-market teams, but for local fans it's not as useful.  Some RSNs, particularly the FanDuel Sports Networks and other options mentioned above, will allow you to pay for their channel without signing up for cable or a streaming TV service.  NBA League Pass is perfect for catching out-of-market NBA action. While it doesn't allow you to stream games airing in your local city or on national TV, with its $100 starting price (and bundling of NBA TV), it is ideal for fans looking to keep up with everything happening around the league.  The NBA last year began offering its own spin on the popular NFL RedZone channel with a \"whip around\" show it calls CrunchTime. This show, available for free on the NBA app, bounces around live games and is designed to show you all the action, particularly close contests.  In the past, most of these \"CrunchTime days\" took place on Monday nights, but there were times when the league would stream it on other days. A 2024-25 schedule hasn't yet been released.  You don't need League Pass or any other subscription to watch CrunchTime, making this a more accessible way to get your basketball fix, even if it's just one day a week. You will need the NBA app and to make an NBA ID (both of which are free).  As mentioned, the NBA's new media deals, which will see Amazon's Prime Video and NBC/Peacock replace TNT, start next year for the 2025-26 season. For this season there are no changes when it comes to the major networks.  For those determined to watch their local basketball team without a cable or satellite TV subscription, a live TV streaming service is the best bet. While it is pricey, DirecTV Stream is the best option for most people, particularly those where the local games air on FanDuel Sports Networks or those looking for the YES Network (Nets fans in New York) or Spectrum SportsNet (Lakers fans in Los Angeles).  DirecTV Stream requires its $113-per-month Choice package to get RSNs (that price includes various fees the company levels on top of the sticker price), though this option also includes ABC, ESPN, TNT and NBA TV, so you should be all set for basketball. If you live in a FanDuel area, you could pair a FanDuel   Sports Plus package with something like Sling Orange and save a few bucks per month. Same for those in New York, Phoenix, Utah or Washington, DC, who can pair their RSNs streaming option with a cheaper TV provider.  Sling Orange runs $40 per month and includes ESPN and TNT while FanDuel Sports Network or those local RSN options -- as mentioned above -- generally run $20 to $30 per month depending on your area and your team. Getting NBA TV runs $11 per month with the Sports Extra add-on.  All told, however, you'd be paying $51 monthly for Sling (including the add-on for NBA TV) and another $20 or $30 for an RSN, which could be a sizable savings compared with DirecTV. It is worth noting that you will need to switch between different apps to stream everything.  Another possible pairing is Fubo, which has the FanDuel Sports RSNs as well as a handful of others, and a streaming service like Max. Fubo lacks TNT, but Max has begun streaming live sports under its Bleacher Report (B/R) Sports banner. You will need to get a Max subscription, which starts at $10 per month for the ad-supported version. Combined with Fubo, that's $95 per month for live basketball.  Below is a chart of all of the NBA teams in the US and their corresponding RSNs.  Note: None of the (US-based) services carry the RSN for the Toronto Raptors (TSN). Fans in the US looking to watch Pascal Siakam and co. need to use NBA League Pass to get all the games that aren't either on your local RSN or on a US national broadcast. Some key takeaways: NBC Sports Washington is now the Monumental Sports Network. The Houston Rockets now play on Space City Home Network (formerly AT&T SportsNet Southwest).  DirecTV Stream is expensive. It's the priciest of the five major live TV streaming services, but it's also the one with the most RSNs. Its cheapest $90-a-month Entertainment package includes ESPN, ABC and TNT. You'll need to move up to the $113-a-month Choice plan to get any available RSN as well as NBA TV. You can use its channel lookup tool to see which local channels and RSNs are available in your area.  Aside from DirecTV Stream and Fubo, the odds are long that a live TV streaming service carries the RSN for your local team's games, which makes the other four services better bets for watching nationally televised games.  It's worth mentioning that for the in-season tournament, quarterfinal games on Dec. 4 and 5 will air on TNT, the semifinals on Dec. 7 will air on TNT and ESPN, and the championship on Dec. 9 will air on ABC.  Sling TV's Orange plan includes ESPN, and both plans offer TBS too, but neither of them gives you access to ABC or the regional sports networks found on more expensive services. NBA TV is available as part of the Sports Extra add-on, which costs $11 a month for either the Blue or Orange plan or $15 for the combined Orange-and-Blue plan. The individual plans cost $40 a month each, and the Orange-and-Blue plan costs $55 a month (in some areas, Blue may be $45 per month and the combo will run $60 monthly). You can see which local channels you get here. It's worth noting that ABC is included with the Blue plan in some markets, the Orange plan includes ESPN3 access which allows for watching those games. YouTube TV costs $73 a month and offers six RSNs for basketball, along with all of the national broadcasts including NBA TV. Plug in your ZIP code on its welcome page to see which local networks and RSNs are available in your area. Fubo costs $80 per month for its Pro option and offers most RSNs for basketball. It also includes ESPN but not TNT -- which might be a problem for some basketball fans. Check out which local networks and RSNs it offers here. Hulu Plus Live TV costs $83 a month and carries a handful of RSNs for basketball, along with ESPN, ABC and TNT, but not NBA TV. Click the \"View all channels in your area\" link at the bottom of its welcome page to see which local networks and RSNs are available where you live. Each live TV streaming service offers a free trial, allows you to cancel anytime and requires a solid internet connection. Looking for more information?

Reviews ethics statement \n    The league leaders look to maintain their unbeaten start to their title defense.\n   Paris Saint Germain looks to maintain their 3-point cushion at the top of Ligue 1 as they host sixth placed Lens at the Parc des Princes on Saturday.  Last weekend's convincing 3-0 away win in Le Classique against Marseille will have boosted confidence among Luis Enrique's players, but today's game should provide a stern test for the home side.  Lens' defense has proven hard to break down so far this season. However, they come into this match off the back of their first defeat of the campaign, after falling to a 2-0 defeat at home to Lille after conceding twice in stoppage time. Paris Saint-Germain take on Lens on Saturday, Nov. 2 at the Parc des Princes, with kickoff set for 5 p.m. CET local time, making it an 4 p.m. GMT start in the UK, a 12 p.m. ET or 9 a.m. PT start in the US and Canada, and a 3 a.m. AEDT kickoff in Australia early on Sunday morning. Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch game lives wherever you are in the world. João Neves celebrates his first goal for PSG last week in his team's 3-0 win against Marseille.  Sunday's game is live on BeIN Sports, which holds broadcast rights for Ligue 1 matches in the US.  There are a number of options for watching BeIN. Several cable and satellite TV providers in the US offer the network as part of their channel lineup, including Dish Network, Optimum and Spectrum (the latter requiring $7 per month for the Sports View add-on). If you're a cord-cutter, there's a whole host of streaming platforms that carry BeIN Sports. With an excellent channel selection, easy-to-use interface and best-in-class cloud DVR, the $73 per month YouTube TV is one of the best cable TV replacements. In order to watch BeIN Sports on the platform you'll need its Sports Plus add-on, which costs an additional $11 per month. Read our YouTube TV review. BeIN is available on Sling TV as part of its Sports Extra add-on for either Sling Orange or Sling Blue. Its Orange and Blue packages start at $40 per month, and you can combine them for a monthly rate of $55 ($60 in some regions), with Sports Extra costing an extra $11 a month. The Orange option nets you one stream, while Blue gives you three. It's not as comprehensive or as easy to navigate as YouTube, but with a bit of work, including adding an antenna or an AirTV 2 DVR, it's unbeatable value. We'll also add that the service offers local channels such as ABC and CBS in some regions where the monthly rate is $45. Read our Sling TV review. There's a lot to like about Fubo. In addition to BeIN Sports, it offers a wide selection of channels, plus its sports focus makes it especially attractive to soccer fans, as well as NBA, NHL and MLB fans who live in an area served by one of Fubo's RSNs. It's also a great choice for NFL fans, since it's one of three services, alongside YouTube TV and Hulu, that offer NFL Network and optional RedZone. The biggest hole in Fubo's lineup is the lack of Warner Bros. Discovery networks, including HGTV, Food Network, Cartoon Network, CNN, TNT and TBS -- especially since the latter two carry a lot of sports content, in particular NBA, NHL and MLB. Those missing channels, and the $80 price tag, make it less attractive than YouTube TV for most viewers. Read our Fubo review. On top of this, BeIN Sports Connect is the network's standalone streaming platform. You can log in with your cable or streaming service credentials if your provider has BeIN in the package. This allows you to stream live matches and other programming on various devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops and so on). Make sure to check if BeIN Sports is included in the specific package or plan you are considering, as it might be part of a sports bundle or require an additional subscription.  If you find yourself unable to view Ligue 1 matches locally, you may need a different way to watch the games -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins.  With a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.  Using a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.  ExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN, and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, but if you sign up for an annual subscription for $100 you'll get three months free and save 49%. That's the equivalent of $6.67 a month with code SPECIALDEAL, which should be automatically applied. Note that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. As with the US, BeIN Sports is where it's at for fans of French soccer looking to watch this match in Canada, with the network holding the rights to broadcast Ligue 1 matches in the region this season.  BeIN Sports is available on select Canadian cable and satellite providers including Bell TV, Rogers and Shaw Direct, while cord-cutters can access BeIN through streaming service Fubo Canada.  Fubo is the go-to destination for Canadians looking to watch the Ligue 1 season, with exclusive streaming rights to every match on Sunday. It costs CA$30 a month, though you can save some cash by paying quarterly or annually. French football fans in the UK were left up in the air at the start of the season, following TNT Sport's decision not to renew broadcast rights for Ligue 1. There is now at last an option for watching games live, with dedicated streaming platform Ligue 1 Pass up and running and showing today's game live. French football fans can now watch every Ligue 1 game live on subscription streaming service Ligue 1 Pass. The service is priced at £10 per month, and can be accessed via the Ligue 1 Pass website. Dedicated apps for Apple and Android devices are set to become available for the service in the coming weeks.  No mainstream broadcaster currently owns the rights to show Ligue 1 football this season Down Under.  If you subscribe to an overseas streaming service that's showing the game, such as Fubo, a VPN service will allow you to change your online location, allowing you to watch your domestic coverage."

Several cable and satellite TV providers in the US offer the network as part of their channel lineup, including Dish Network, Optimum and Spectrum (the latter requiring $7 per month for the Sports View add-on). If you're a cord-cutter, there's a whole host of streaming platforms that carry BeIN Sports. With an excellent channel selection, easy-to-use interface and best-in-class cloud DVR, the $73 per month YouTube TV is one of the best cable TV replacements. In order to watch BeIN Sports on the platform you'll need its Sports Plus add-on, which costs an additional $11 per month. Read our YouTube TV review. BeIN is available on Sling TV as part of its Sports Extra add-on for either Sling Orange or Sling Blue. Its Orange and Blue packages start at $40 per month, and you can combine them for a monthly rate of $55 ($60 in some regions), with Sports Extra costing an extra $11 a month. The Orange option nets you one stream, while Blue gives you three. It's not as comprehensive or as easy to navigate as YouTube, but with a bit of work, including adding an antenna or an AirTV 2 DVR, it's unbeatable value. We'll also add that the service offers local channels such as ABC and CBS in some regions where the monthly rate is $45. Read our Sling TV review. There's a lot to like about Fubo. In addition to BeIN Sports, it offers a wide selection of channels, plus its sports focus makes it especially attractive to soccer fans, as well as NBA, NHL and MLB fans who live in an area served by one of Fubo's RSNs. It's also a great choice for NFL fans, since it's one of three services, alongside YouTube TV and Hulu, that offer NFL Network and optional RedZone. The biggest hole in Fubo's lineup is the lack of Warner Bros. Discovery networks, including HGTV, Food Network, Cartoon Network, CNN, TNT and TBS -- especially since the latter two carry a lot of sports content, in particular NBA, NHL and MLB. Those missing channels, and the $80 price tag, make it less attractive than YouTube TV for most viewers. Read our Fubo review. On top of this, BeIN Sports Connect is the network's standalone streaming platform. You can log in with your cable or streaming service credentials if your provider has BeIN in the package. This allows you to stream live matches and other programming on various devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops and so on). Make sure to check if BeIN Sports is included in the specific package or plan you are considering, as it might be part of a sports bundle or require an additional subscription.  If you find yourself unable to view Ligue 1 matches locally, you may need a different way to watch the games -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins.  With a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.  Using a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.  ExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN, and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, but if you sign up for an annual subscription for $100 you'll get three months free and save 49%. That's the equivalent of $6.67 a month with code SPECIALDEAL, which should be automatically applied. Note that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. As with the US, BeIN Sports is where it's at for fans of French soccer looking to watch this match in Canada, with the network holding the rights to broadcast Ligue 1 matches in the region this season.  BeIN Sports is available on select Canadian cable and satellite providers including Bell TV, Rogers and Shaw Direct, while cord-cutters can access BeIN through streaming service Fubo Canada.  Fubo is the go-to destination for Canadians looking to watch the Ligue 1 season, with exclusive streaming rights to every match on Sunday. It costs CA$30 a month, though you can save some cash by paying quarterly or annually. French football fans in the UK were left up in the air at the start of the season, following TNT Sport's decision not to renew broadcast rights for Ligue 1. There is now at last an option for watching games live, with dedicated streaming platform Ligue 1 Pass now up and running and showing today's game live. French football fans can now watch every Ligue 1 game live on subscription streaming service Ligue 1 Pass. The service is priced at £10 per month, and can be accessed via the Ligue 1 Pass website. Dedicated apps for Apple and Android devices are set to become available for the service in the coming weeks.  No mainstream broadcaster currently owns the rights to show Ligue 1 football this season Down Under.  If you subscribe to an overseas streaming service that's showing the game, such as Fubo, a VPN service will allow you to change your online location, allowing you to watch your domestic coverage."

Real went into the international break off the back of a 2-0 victory over Villarreal, with Federico Valverde and Vinicius Junior both getting on the scoresheet for the defending champions who currently find themselves second in the table, three points behind Barca.

Reviews ethics statement \n    A win for the Blues could see them climb into the top four.\n   Two sides looking to bounce back from frustrating EPL defeats last weekend face off at Stamford Bridge on Sunday as Chelsea host Newcastle.  Chelsea's bright run of seven games unbeaten in all competitions was brought to an end by a narrow 2-1 defeat to league leader Liverpool last Sunday. Enzo Maresca's men responded well with a convincing 1-4  against Panathinaikos in the Europa Conference League, and a win here against one of their rivals' Champions League qualification would see them climb to fourth.  There's a similar incentive for Eddie Howe's Newcastle, who could leapfrog Chelsea into seventh with a win today in west London. Any such victory would need to see an improvement from the Magpies frontline, with the visitors failing to score in their last two matches.  Chelsea vs. Newcastle on Sunday, Oct. 27 at Stamford Bridge, with kickoff set for 2 p.m. GMT local time, making it a 10 a.m. ET or 7 a.m. PT start in the U.S. and Canada and a 1 a.m. AEDT kickoff in Australia in the early hours of Monday morning.  Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch the match as it happens, wherever you are in the world. João Félix will be hoping he has put himself in contention for a start for today following his two goals in Chelsea's midweek 1-4 European victory over Panathinaikos.   Sunday's Chelsea vs. Newcastle match is streaming on USA Network, which you can access as part of your cable package or at the NBC Sports website with a valid login. It can also be streamed via Sling TV and other, more expensive streaming TV services.  Sling TV's Blue plan includes USA Network, making it a great option for fans wanting to watch Premier League action. It's $40 per month and features over 40 channels, including other sports channels like ESPN and FS1.  Read our Sling TV review.

Fubo is the go-to destination for Canadians looking to watch the EPL this season, with exclusive streaming rights to every match. It costs CA$30 per month, although you can save some cash by paying quarterly or annually.

With Real not playing this weekend due to their match with Valencia being postponed, a win today for Barca would see them open up a massive 9 point lead over their title rivals at the top of the table.

Both sides came through midweek Champions League wins, albeit in unconvincing style, with Mikel Arteta's Arsenal securing a narrow 1-0 win at home over Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk and Liverpool toiling to a victory at Anfield against RB Leipzig via the same scoreline.

Make sure you wash it correctly to prevent pilling or losing elasticity.\n   To clean your activewear, you'll just need a few supplies that you probably have lying around your home.  You've likely spent hundreds of dollars on activewear. One Lululemon workout set alone can cost $200. And a decent pair of workout leggings could cost between $50 and $90 a piece. After investing in quality sportswear, you'll want to get as much use out of them as possible. And that means you need to wash your activewear separately. Because of the materials used, activewear can be tricky to clean without losing elasticity or wicking power. Most athletic clothing is made with polyester, nylon and other materials that can wear down quickly if not washed correctly. And that's not to mention how easily these clothes collect sweat, lint and grime.  You likely spent a pretty penny on your leggings, sports bras, athletic shorts and yoga pants, so you'll want to wash them the right way to extend the life span of each article. Here's how.  Read more: Check out our guide on the best way to clean a yoga mat and how to clean running shoes. To clean your activewear, you'll just need a few supplies that you probably have lying around your home.  Most of your athletic wear can be washed in the washing machine on a gentle cycle with cold water.  Most of your athletic wear can be washed in the washing machine on a gentle cycle with cold water. Like doing any other loads, separate the darks from the lights, and turn all clothes inside out before putting them into the washing machine. Most machine-safe items are straightforward to wash. After separating into piles and turning clothing inside out, add detergent and start the cold cycle. The water temperature is critical. Hot water can damage the fibers of the fabrics, plus most detergents are designed to work more efficiently in cold water anyway.  Cotton workout clothes, like many T-shirts, can be washed on a normal cycle, but still stick to cold water.  Pro tip: If your clothes still smell after machine washing, soak the item in water with a cup of white vinegar for 30 minutes or so and then machine wash again.  I recommend hand-washing your sports bras to prevent the padding from rolling up or creasing. Simply fill up your sink with cold water and add about a half cup of Woolite or another delicate detergent. Let soak for 30 minutes to an hour before rinsing with clean water.  For a full rundown on cleaning running shoes, check out our guide here. The best way to dry activewear is to lay it flat.  I know it's tempting to throw your clothes into the dryer for a speedier process, but it's best to skip the dryer when it comes to activewear. The heat can ruin the fibers, making your workout clothes less stretchy, tighter and pilled. It's best practice to lay the activewear flat and let it air dry, so the clothes can retain their shape.  Looking for more workout recommendations?

Reviews ethics statement \n    The hosts are on the brink of relegation from Group A1 as they face Ronaldo and co. in Glasgow.\n   Things don't get any easier for winless Scotland as they take on Group A1 leaders Portugal in this crucial UEFA Nations League match at Hampden Park today.  Despite taking an early lead with a first-half Ryan Christie strike, Scotland crashed to a 2-1 defeat away to Croatia on Saturday -- a result that puts them in grave danger of being relegated to the second tier of this competition.  Portugal, meanwhile, are cruising to a place in the quarterfinals with three wins from three games. Their latest was a 3-1 triumph over Poland at the weekend, in a match that saw Bernardo Silva and Cristiano Ronaldo both get on the scoresheet.  Scotland host Portugal at Hampden Park in Glasgow on Tuesday, Oct. 15. Kickoff is set for 7:45 p.m. BST local time in Scotland. That makes it a 2:45 p.m. ET or 11:45 a.m. PT in the US and Canada, and 5:45 a.m. AEDT on Wednesday, Oct. 16 in Australia. Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch the game live wherever you are in the world. Veteran midfielder Bernardo Silva opened the scoring for Portugal in their 3-1 away win against Poland at the weekend.  Today's game is on Fubo Sports Network, the streaming platform's dedicated sports service.  There's a lot to like about Fubo. In addition to it's own Fubo Sports Network, it offers a wide selection of channels, plus its sports focus makes it especially attractive to soccer fans, as well as NBA, NHL and MLB fans who live in an area served by one of Fubo's RSNs. It's also a great choice for NFL fans, since it's one of three services, alongside YouTube TV and Hulu, that offer NFL Network and optional RedZone. The biggest hole in Fubo's lineup is the lack of Warner Bros. Discovery networks, including HGTV, Food Network, Cartoon Network, CNN, TNT and TBS -- especially since the latter two carry a lot of sports content, in particular NBA, NHL and MLB. Those missing channels, and the $80 price tag, makes it less attractive than YouTube TV for most viewers. Read our Fubo review. If you find yourself unable to view this Nations League fixture locally, you may need a different way to watch the match -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins.  With a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.  Using a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.  ExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN, and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, but if you sign up for an annual subscription for $100 you'll get three months free and save 49%. That's the equivalent of $6.67 a month with code SPECIALDEAL, which should be automatically applied. Note that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. While this match won't be broadcast by a traditional linear network in the UK, the great news for footy fans is that the game will be available to watch live and for free via the Viaplay International YouTube channel with kickoff scheduled for 7:45 p.m. BST. Football fans Down Under can also watch this match on streaming service Optus Sport.  With exclusive rights to screen every EPL match live this season, as well as German Bundesliga and Spanish La Liga games and international fixtures, streaming service Optus Sport is a particularly big draw for Aussie soccer fans. If you're already an Optus network customer you can bag Optus Sport for a reduced price of AU$10 a month. If you're not, a standalone monthly subscription to the service starts at AU$25. If you want to stream this game live in Canada, you'll need to subscribe to DAZN Canada. A DAZN subscription currently costs CA$25 a month or CA$200 a year and will also give you access to the UEFA Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League, plus EFL Championship soccer, Six Nations rugby and WTA tennis. As well as dedicated apps for iOS and Android, there's a wide range of support for set-top boxes and smart TVs."

Carsley's decision to experiment with an attacking but unbalanced lineup backfired with a shocking 2-1 midweek loss against Greece -- a result that will likely see the visitors opt for a more conservative approach in Helsinki.  Finland are also looking to to bounce back after Markku Kanerva's side squandered a one-goal lead to slip to a 2-1 defeat at home against Ireland on Thursday.  Finland host England at the Helsingin Olympiastadion in Helsinki on Sunday, Oct. 13.

If you find yourself unable to view this Nations League fixture locally, you may need a different way to watch the match -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins.  With a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.  Using a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.  ExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN, and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, but if you sign up for an annual subscription for $100 you'll get three months free and save 49%. That's the equivalent of $6.67 a month with code SPECIALDEAL, which should be automatically applied. Note that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. The great news for footy fans in the UK is that free-to-air broadcaster ITV will be showing all of England's Nations League matches for this season, with this game being shown on ITV1.  Coverage begins at 4:15 p.m. BST ahead of the 5 p.m. kickoff. As the match is being broadcast on ITV1, that means you'll also have the option of watching the game online for free via the network's on-demand streaming service, ITVX (formerly ITV Hub). The service has an updated app that's available for Android and Apple mobile devices, as well as a vast array of smart TVs. Football fans Down Under can also watch this match on streaming service Optus Sport.  With exclusive rights to screen every EPL match live this season, as well as German Bundesliga and Spanish La Liga games and international fixtures, streaming service Optus Sport is a particularly big draw for Aussie soccer fans. If you're already an Optus network customer you can bag Optus Sport for a reduced price of AU$10 per month. If you're not, a standalone monthly subscription to the service starts at AU$25. If you want to stream this game live in Canada, you'll need to subscribe to DAZN Canada. A DAZN subscription currently costs CA$25 a month or CA$200 a year and will also give you access to the UEFA Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League, plus EFL Championship soccer, Six Nations rugby and WTA tennis. As well as dedicated apps for iOS and Android, there's a wide range of support for set-top boxes and smart TVs."

Be sure to check out the these VPN deals taking place right now.       ExpressVPN has servers in the LA area, where this game is being shown. The service is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN, and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, but if you sign up for an annual subscription for $100 you'll get three months free and save 49%. That's the equivalent of $6.67 a month with code SPECIALDEAL, which should be automatically applied. Note that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. This week's Chargers-Browns game is on CBS, so in addition to a VPN, you'll need a live TV streaming service that carries a local CBS affiliate that's broadcasting the game. The good news for football fans is that CBS is available on most of the major streaming services. The least expensive option is Paramount Plus.       Those looking for CBS' Sunday games will be able to stream them on Paramount Plus with its $8 per month Essentials tier. You can check for yourself if your area has live CBS streaming here. Read our Paramount Plus review.\n   Numerous other live TV streaming services carry local CBS stations as well, namely YouTube TV, Hulu Plus Live TV, DirecTV Stream and Fubo. They all cost far more than Paramount Plus, but they also carry many live channels, including football broadcasting channels like Fox and ESPN. Check out our live TV streaming services guide for details.       If you live in an area where the game is being broadcast, an over-the-air antenna connected to your TV provides another option for CBS. The best part about antennas is that there are no streaming or monthly fees required, though you will need to make sure you have good reception.      "
