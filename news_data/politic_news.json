            "content": "With only a few days left until the US presidential election, Donald Trump is claiming that some of Silicon Valley’s most powerful billionaires and tech leaders are seeking him out. Many of these leaders, like Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, became figureheads for Trump’s ire over what he believed to be censorship of conservative speech online. Now, as some of the most powerful people in Silicon Valley appear to be quietly sitting out the presidential election cycle, Trump is saying they’ve grown more complimentary of the former president as polls continue to show Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris neck and neck. Influential business leaders are hedging their bets and preparing themselves and their interests just in case Trump wins, according to the Washington Post. Of course, it’s not all just hearsay—Tesla CEO Elon Musk has explicitly thrown his money and support behind the former president in recent weeks. Here’s a running list of the Silicon Valley CEOs Trump says are courting him in the lead-up to the election: On Joe Rogan’s podcast on Friday, Trump claimed that Google CEO Sundar Pichai called to congratulate the former president on his viral McDonald’s stunt. “This McDonald’s thing, I want to tell you, it’s one of the biggest things we’ve seen on Google,” Trump said Pichai told him. Trump repeated the claim again during a Saturday rally in Pennsylvania: “I actually got a call from Sundar, Sundar, who’s great, from Google, he’s a great guy, very smart. The head of Google,” he said. “And he said, ‘Sir, I just want to tell you, what you did with McDonald’s was one of the single biggest events we’ve ever had at Google.’” Trump once again described the alleged call during a Sunday evening rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Pichai has not publicly confirmed if this conversation took place. Google has not responded to requests for comment from WIRED. Earlier this month, Trump said that Cook had called him to complain about a multibillion-dollar fine Apple received from the European Union this year. “[Cook] said something that was interesting,” Trump said. “He said they’re using that to run their enterprise, meaning Europe is their enterprise.” I said, ‘That’s a lot … But Tim, I got to get elected first, but I’m not going to let them take advantage of our companies—that won’t, you know, be happening.’” Trump’s relationship with Apple CEO Tim Cook is one of the most congenial the former president has shared with a Silicon Valley leader. Cook maintained a relationship with Trump during his time in office, often meeting with the president and serving on advisory panels influencing policy decisions that affect Apple’s business, such as tariffs and immigration. Cook has not publicly confirmed that this most recent call took place. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED. Shortly after the assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, this summer, the former president claimed that Zuckerberg called him. In an interview with New York magazine, Trump claimed that Zuckerberg said, “‘I will never vote for people running against you after watching what you did.’” A Meta spokesperson contested what Trump told the magazine, saying, “As Mark has said publicly, he’s not endorsing anybody in this race and has not communicated to anybody how he intends to vote.” (Zuckerberg did not endorse any candidate in the 2016 and 2020 elections and has said that he won’t this cycle either.) While Meta wouldn’t detail the contents of the call, Zuckerberg confirmed he had called Trump after the assassination attempt, calling the former president “bad ass” in July. “Seeing Donald Trump get up after getting shot in the face and pump his fist in the air with the American flag is one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen in my life,” Zuckerberg said. Under Trump, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sustained countless attacks from the Trump administration and conservative lawmakers over censorship allegations. In 2020, Zuckerberg donated $350 million in pandemic support to election departments around the country. Republicans accused these “Zuckerbucks” donations of being unfairly distributed to Democratic districts. In 2021, following the January 6 riot at the Capitol, Trump was banned from Facebook and Instagram. Former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has been under fire in recent days after he decided that the Washington Post would no longer endorse presidential candidates, despite the paper having a Harris endorsement in the works. Trump has long criticized Bezos for his ownership of the Washington Post, but Trump said that Bezos had called him after this summer’s assassination attempt. “It is the most incredible thing I’ve ever watched,” Trump said Bezos told him. “I said, ‘Despite the fact you own the Washington Post, I appreciate it.” Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, reportedly called Trump after the July shooting as well. Much of Bezos’ and Amazon’s business interests rely on government contracts, especially with Amazon Web Services, Amazon’s cloud computing arm, and Blue Origin. Amazon and Blue Origin did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Two years after acquiring Twitter to bring “free speech” back to the platform, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has gone full MAGA. Musk formally endorsed Trump on X after the July assassination attempt, writing, “Last time America had a candidate this tough was Theodore Roosevelt.” Since then, Musk has become one of Trump’s largest donors, spending more than $110 million to bolster the former president’s campaign. The Musk-backed America PAC is aggressively canvassing across battleground states to turn out the vote for Trump. Musk has also joined Trump on the campaign trail, spending the past few weeks stumping for Trump in states like Pennsylvania. Musk has also been using X to support Trump’s campaign, frequently reposting campaign material and links for users to register to vote. X CEO Linda Yaccarino has not endorsed Trump, but has tweeted messages of support after the July shooting and previously served on a Trump administration council promoting public health.

            "content": "If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED Our social media platforms and government have had four years to get this right. Instead, they’ve thrown up their hands. In the days following January 6, Meta, Twitter, YouTube, and Twitch suspended former president Donald Trump over posts the companies said glorified the violence at the Capitol. It was the most extreme moderation decision these companies had ever made. Platforms also took sweeping actions to remove thousands of accounts belonging to militias, conspiracy theorists, and the content they shared that led the US to that moment. But that didn’t last long. It's not your average politics newsletter. Makena Kelly and the WIRED Politics team help you make sense of how the internet is shaping our political reality. After the 2022 midterms, the balance of power shifted in Congress. Republicans now had a majority—albeit a slim one—in the House of Representatives and used that sliver of power to go after the researchers and trust and safety workers who did the dizzying work of debunking election myths. Jim Jordan was elevated to chair of the powerful House Judiciary Committee and immediately launched investigations stifling the work of academics at best and launching harassment campaigns against entire moderation teams at worst. As a result of these attacks, the Stanford Internet Observatory, one of the top disinformation research groups, shut down for good over the summer. Now, much of the social media infrastructure built to protect our democratic systems in the months and days after the deadly riot has collapsed—either by inattention or force. There are only five days left until Election Day and a chasm has formed in what little foundation remains. To start with what we all know: Elon Musk took over Twitter and turned it into X, a conspiratorial wasteland where professional disinformation purveyors earn thousands of dollars peddling lies. Musk reinstated accounts belonging to Alex Jones and Andrew Tate, both of which were banned years before the 2020 election cycle even began. And, to bring us to the present day, Musk has spent the last few weeks campaigning for Trump and spreading election lies. These fissures in platforms have happened across the board. Last year, Alphabet, Meta, and X reduced the size of their trust and safety teams and Meta completely abandoned a project building a new fact-checking tool as a result of cuts. Not only has Meta cast a blind eye to the militias currently organizing on its platforms, it is auto-generating militia-related groups. “To imply that Meta has abandoned its election integrity efforts is absurd and irresponsible as it ignores our work: we have around 40,000 people globally working on safety and security—more than we had in 2020, have grown our fact checking program to more than 100 independent partners, taken down over 200 covert coordinated influence operations, and removed more than a thousand banned militia organizations,\" Meta spokesperson Erica Sackin tells WIRED. Not only are these big tech CEOs revising their moderation policies to allow more trash to find an audience, Trump has recently said that many of Silicon Valley’s wealthiest tech executives have called to suck up to him. “Social media platforms have by and large stopped moderating such content and just as worryingly have cut off researcher access to data streams that allowed us to objectively report on the scale of these campaigns, all due to political pressure on disinformation researchers and social media platforms,” Nina Jankowicz, the Biden administration’s former disinformation czar, told my colleague David Gilbert this week when he wrote about election conspiracy theories and falsehoods already spread unchecked online. Far-right agitators are laying the groundwork for violence and election denial. Fears over noncitizens voting may have led to eligible voters being removed from Virginia’s voter rolls. “The work of studying election delegitimization and supporting election officials is more important than ever. It is crucial that we not only stand resolute but speak out forcefully against intimidation tactics intended to silence us and discredit academic research,” Renee DiResta, former director of the Stanford program, wrote in The New York Times in June. Under the Biden administration, the Democrats fashioned themselves a bastion for deplatforming online bullshit. While a majority of election lies are spread by far-right influencers and activists, the Democrats are beginning to take their role less seriously as well. The Harris campaign rewrote news headlines and ran them as ads on Google, deceptively edited TikTok content, and spent $11 million on a Facebook page to boost positive coverage of the campaign. If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em I guess. If you thought 2020 was bad, all of these decisions have led to an internet that’s worse off than in prior elections. The same bad actors are using the same playbook as before, but the tools to address it have disappeared. After a winner is declared, if that’s next week or months into the future, the next big question will be who will accept the results of the election.

            "content": "For months, billionaire and X owner Elon Musk has used his platform to share election conspiracy theories that could undermine faith in the outcome of the 2024 election. Last week, the political action committee (PAC) Musk backs took it a step further, launching a group on X called the Election Integrity Community. The group has nearly 50,000 members and says that it is meant to be a place where users can “share potential incidents of voter fraud or irregularities you see while voting in the 2024 election.” In practice, it is a cesspool of election conspiracy theories, alleging everything from unauthorized immigrants voting to misspelled candidate names on ballots. “It's just an election denier jamboree,” says Paul Barrett, deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University, who authored a recent report on how social media facilitates political violence. Since endorsing former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump following the first assassination attempt against him in July, Musk has become one of Trump’s most important financial backers, pouring more than $100 million into the America PAC since July. The PAC has also been a pillar of the Trump campaign’s ground game in swing states. WIRED reporting found that Blitz Canvassing, a contractor for the PAC, was threatening canvassers in Michigan, and transporting them in U-Hauls. Earlier in October, Musk appeared at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he repeated false claims that Democrats would allow undocumented immigrants to vote illegally, and encouraged Trump’s supporters to vote. In January 2021, the company then known as Twitter banned Trump’s account for incitement to violence during the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. But since taking over and rebranding it as X, Musk has fired many of the people on the teams that worked to keep mis- and disinformation off the platform. Last year, X fired much of what remained of its elections integrity team. After the news broke, Musk posted on X, saying, “Oh you mean the ‘Election Integrity’ Team that was undermining election integrity? Yeah, they’re gone.” Barrett says that the America PAC’s Election Integrity Community group augments the work of other election-denying groups, like former Trump adviser Cleta Mitchell’s Election Integrity Network. “This is a parallel anti-election, anti-democracy campaign designed to sow confusion and lay the groundwork for baseless objections to elections after Election Day. This is going on all across the country, and it's extremely dangerous,” says Barrett. “And we're going to see the results of it almost immediately when the polls close on November 5th.”  Inside the group, multiple accounts shared a viral video of a person ripping up ballots, allegedly from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, which US intelligence agencies have said is fake. Another account shared a video from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones alleging that unauthorized immigrants were being bussed to polling locations to vote. One video shared multiple times, and also purportedly from Buck County, shows a voter confronting a woman with a “voter protection” tag on a lanyard who tells the woman filming that she is there for “early vote monitoring” and asks not to be recorded. Text in the accompanying post says that there were “long lines and early cut offs” and alleges election interference. That post has been viewed more than 1 million times. Some accounts merely retweet local news stories, or right-wing influencers like Lara Loomer and Jack Posobiec, rather than sharing their own personal experiences. One account merely reshared a post from Sidney Powell, the disgraced lawyer who attempted to help Trump overturn the 2020 election, in which she says that voting machines in Wisconsin connect to the internet, and therefore could be tampered with. In actuality, voting machines are difficult to hack. Many of the accounts reference issues in swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. But Barrett says that the real value of this group, and others like it, is not necessarily to collect or verify actual issues at polling places or with voting machines—things that can, and do, happen in a normal election. Instead, it is a way to bolster claims that the election is being stolen, amassing thousands of “examples” that will serve to support an argument that Trump lost by fraud if he is defeated at that ballot box. “This is another cynical and destructive step that Musk and many, many others on the political right are taking to undermine faith in elections, because of their anxiety that if elections are just held in a conventional, straightforward way, their side loses,” he says.

            "content": "The denizens of cryptoland have erupted into celebration and gleeful told-you-so's after Donald Trump, the self-styled “crypto president,” was voted back into the White House on Wednesday morning. Under the Democratic administration led by President Joe Biden, crypto companies have felt they were being singled out for persecution by US financial regulators and denied access to essential services like banking. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, the current vice president, was viewed by the crypto faithful as complicit by proximity and likely to replicate this strategy. (Harris never declared her intentions towards the crypto industry.) But a victory for Trump marks the start of a promising new chapter, they say. “This election was completely existential for crypto in the US,” claims Nic Carter, a general partner at crypto-focused VC firm Castle Island Ventures. “The first [response] is relief. We have been trying to build businesses with one hand tied behind our backs. I can’t emphasize how hard that is.” Under Trump, the industry expects a far friendlier reception from regulators, says Carter, as well as legislation that sets out specific rules for crypto firms. And if Trump incorporates bitcoin into the US government’s balance sheet, advocates speculate it could stoke demand for bitcoin among other world powers, thereby further inflating the price, which rose to record heights after Trump’s victory was confirmed. In short, to them, everything is coming up Milhouse. “Just ceasing the hostilities would have been immensely positive, but we got something better: a candidate that is overtly pro-crypto,” says Carter. “Last night could not have gone any better.” Some of crypto’s largest companies—among them crypto exchange Coinbase and stablecoin issuer Circle—have insisted during the 2024 election cycle that crypto need not become a partisan issue. But crypto figureheads largely lined up behind the Republican candidate: Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, cofounders of crypto platform Gemini, each donated $1 million to Trump, as did Jesse Powell, cofounder of the Kraken exchange. Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, whose VC firm a16z has invested billions of dollars in crypto startups, publicly endorsed Trump for the presidency. “We are on the brink of a new American Renaissance,” wrote Tyler Winklevoss in a post on X, after it became clear that Trump had beaten Harris. On the campaign trail, Trump went out of his way to court their favor. In July, speaking to thousands of bitcoiners at a conference in Nashville, Tennessee, Trump duly sang from the bitcoin hymn sheet, promising to cement the US as the foremost bitcoin mining powerhouse, establish a national “bitcoin stockpile,” and appoint a bitcoin advisory council if reelected. Trump claimed he would turn the US into the “crypto capital of the planet.” In October, Trump went as far as to launch his own crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, which his family has marketed as a way to “make finance great again.” The platform is set to provide peer-to-peer borrowing and lending services of some flavor, though the Trumps have provided few hard details. “If you were a single-issue voter that cares about the growth of sound money through bitcoin, Trump was the clear choice,” says Peter McCormack, host of the podcast What Bitcoin Did. By contrast, Harris’ Democratic platform for 2024 did not include any mention of crypto, and she made only a single reference to crypto on the campaign trail, in a pitch to donors in New York City, Bloomberg reported. \"We will encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting consumers and investors. We will create a safe business environment with consistent and transparent rules of the road,” Harris is quoted as saying. Reticence in the Harris camp to take a public stance on crypto was interpreted by industry members as a signal that her presidency would represent a continuation of the bad old times under Biden. “We saw no evidence that she was going to moderate the stance at all,” says Carter. Democrat-supporting members of the crypto industry were left in an awkward position; though they aligned with Harris’ politics, it was conceivable that victory for Trump would be a more beneficial outcome for the sector. “As a crypto entrepreneur, I’m excited about the prospect of a bull market,” says Jonathan Padilla, one of the organizers of Crypto4Harris, a coalition of left-leaning members of the crypto industry. “For crypto in isolation, Trump is probably going to be the much quicker shot of sugar,” says Padilla, even if the president later loses interest. Although the failure to make a persuasive pitch to the crypto electorate is surely not to blame for Harris losing the presidential race to Trump, concedes Padilla, the crypto industry was able to mobilize its capital to put a finger on the political scale. During the 2024 cycle, crypto firms donated hundreds of millions of dollars to three crypto-friendly super political action committees (PACs)—Fairshake, Protect Progress, and Defend American Jobs—the aim of which was to support crypto-friendly congressional candidates and dislodge the industry’s most vociferous critics. The fruits of that investment became clear on Wednesday. In Ohio, incumbent Democratic senator Sherrod Brown, who is depicted as an arch-villain in crypto circles, was unseated by Republican Bernie Moreno. Through Defend American Jobs, the crypto industry spent more than $40 million in support of Moreno. Meanwhile, according to Stand With Crypto, a nonprofit pushing for bespoke crypto regulation in the US, more than 250 pro-crypto representatives have been elected to Congress. “If there’s one thing that crypto probably will have done very effectively it is influence the House,” says Padilla. With Trump in the Oval Office, the industry expects to benefit from further opportunities to access the corridors of power. Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at Circle, believes that a Trump government will allow his business to advise on policy in the same way it does in the rest of the world. “My hope and expectation is that we would have equal access to an incoming Trump administration,” says Disparte. Though change will inevitably be gradual, crypto has earned a “victory lap,” says Disparte. “I’m very confident that 2025 can be a breakthrough year.” In your inbox: A new series of tips for how to use AI every day Meet the masked vigilante tracking down billions in crypto scams Deep dive: This app set out to fight pesticides.

            "content": "United States intelligence officials have been quietly issuing warnings to government agencies all summer about a rising threat of extremist violence tied to the 2024 presidential election, including plots to destroy bins full of paper ballots and promote \"lone wolf\" attacks against election facilities throughout the country. In a series of reports between July and September, analysts at the Department of Homeland Security warned of a “heightened risk” of extremists carrying out attacks in response to the race. Copies of the reports, first reported by WIRED, describe efforts by violent groups to provoke attacks against election infrastructure and spread calls for the assassinations of lawmakers and law enforcement agents. Last month, the agency’s intelligence office emphasized in a report that “perceptions of voter fraud” had risen to become a primary “trigger” for the “mobilization to violence.” This is particularly true, the report says, among groups working to leverage the “concept of a potential civil war.” Fears about “crimes by migrants or minorities” are among other top “triggers,” it says. The documents show that DHS alerted dozens of agencies this summer to online chatter indicating potential attacks on election drop boxes—secured receptacles used in more than 30 states to collect mail-in voter ballots. The text highlights the efforts of an unnamed group to crowdsource information about “incendiary and explosive materials” capable of destroying the boxes and ballots. An extensive list of household mixtures and solvents, which are said to render voter ballots “impossible to process,” was also compiled by members of the group, the report says, and openly shared online. “The United States remains in a heightened, dynamic threat environment and we continue to share information with our law enforcement partners about the threats posed by domestic violent extremists in the context of the 2024 election,” a spokesperson from DHS tells WIRED. \"Violence has no place in our politics, and DHS continues to work with our partners to evaluate and mitigate emerging threats that may arise from domestic or foreign actors. DHS, through CISA, is also helping  election officials and election infrastructure partners bolster resilience in their cyber, physical, and operational security.  The Department continues to advise federal, state, and local partners to remain vigilant to potential threats and encourages the public to report any suspicious activity to local authorities.\" The FBI, which is on a distribution list for several of the reports, declined to comment. The reports were first obtained by Property of the People, a nonprofit focused on transparency and national security, under open records law. The reports contain details about how to commit crimes and avoid law enforcement, which WIRED is not publishing. Wendy Via, cofounder and president of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), says the conclusion reached by DHS matches the consensus of experts in the field: “Election denialism is going to be the primary motivator—if there is going to be violence.” For decades, a growing number of states have adopted election drop boxes as a way to offer voters a dedicated, secure, and convenient way to submit voter ballots ahead of elections. Today, as many as 35 states allow drop boxes in some capacity, though a handful—nearly all southern—have outlawed their use, mostly over baseless claims about fraud and ballot stuffing. While drop boxes are no less secure than other forms of voting, Republicans have scrambled to block their use in key states, including Wisconsin, where Donald Trump blasted legislation expanding drop boxes as “only good for Democrats and cheating.” Via points to the Republican-led campaign aimed at banning and restricting access to election drop boxes in Wisconsin as a flash point for election denialism and possible violence. The obsession with the otherwise mundane practice of dropping off ballots prior to election day stems in large part from the widely discredited film 2,000 Mules. The “documentary” depicts a shadowy network of operatives attempting to sway the 2020 election by stuffing ballots in Joe Biden’s favor; the film’s publisher, a conservative media company, has since issued an apology. While the film’s evidence turned out to be false, it nevertheless provoked a surge of intimidation from far-right groups targeting drop-box voters and the officials defending their use. For the November election, some groups have committed to fundraising in order to surveil the boxes around the clock over public livestream. Others have hosted events near the locations to push conspiracy theories about immigrants. Election denial groups such as True the Vote, meanwhile, are working with myriad others across the country, as WIRED reported this summer, and are establishing a web of operations for waging legal warfare in the aftermath of the vote—if Trump fails to retake the White House a second time. Spurious claims of voter fraud have remained a mainstay of the former president’s reelection efforts, with Trump preemptively and baselessly claiming that should he lose in November, the election will have been rigged. Claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen have been exhaustively investigated and debunked by countless judges and state election officials across the country. Property of the People executive director Ryan Shapiro says that though DHS does not mention the political leanings of the subjects in its reports, he believes “the documents make plain that US intelligence is bracing for election- and immigration-related violence from Trump's MAGA minions.” The concerns of DHS today are reminiscent of warnings shared by the agency two years ago during the midterm elections. Similar bulletins leaked then showing fears among federal security officials that extremists would mount an attack, threaten poll workers, or sabotage infrastructure. The concerns proved largely unwarranted, outside of scattered instances of armed men in paramilitary gear showing up to “monitor” ballot boxes across Arizona—an effort quietly spearheaded in part by True the Vote, which helped make 2,000 mules, involving militias that included the American Patriots Three Percent, an anti-government group. The election threats flagged in the reports by DHS appear to be growing more extreme over time. No longer restricted to aggressive surveillance and loitering outside polling locations, the risks associated by DHS with election fraud conspiracies today more closely resemble traditional acts of terrorism. There are, however, some deterrents. The arrests and prosecutions of rioters involved in the January 6 attack on the United States Capitol building are credited by DHS, as well as groups such as GPAHE, with stifling much of the enthusiasm that far-rights groups once held for turning out in big numbers. “In my lifetime of working in civil rights, the January 6 arrests are the only time I’ve ever seen an arrest or prosecution work as a deterrent,” says Via. “They really do not want to go to jail.” 10/17/2024: This story has been updated with comment from DHS.

            "content": "Earlier this year, a Pennsylvania man beheaded his father, who worked as a federal employee, and displayed the severed head in a video where he urged viewers to rise up against the government. Another man in Illinois was building bombs he hoped to one day use against a “corrupt government.” In two separate cases, people were arrested for threatening to kill President Joe Biden and federal officials. An Arizona man plotted a mass shooting at a rap concert in Atlanta because he wanted to spark a race war ahead of what he believed was “impending martial law.” All five of these cases, which occurred over the past eight months, have been linked by the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis to what it sees as a concerning trend: fantasies and conspiracies of an impending civil war mobilizing individuals toward violence surrounding the US election. The memo, first reported by WIRED, was circulated last month to law enforcement agencies. “Some domestic violent extremists (DVEs) are reacting to the 2024 election season and prominent policy issues by engaging in illegal preparatory or violent activity that they link to the narrative of an impending civil war, raising the risk of violence against government targets and ideological opponents,” the memo states. Online chatter about civil war has become an inevitable knee-jerk response to any divisive sociopolitical news event in recent years—from prosecutions of Capitol rioters and the attempted assassination of Donald Trump to disputes over enforcement at the US–Mexico border. And that chatter has, perhaps unsurprisingly, only continued to ramp up ahead of the 2024 election. Intelligence analysts say that they have seen online discussions about preparing for future violence against public officials and federal agents and are aware that some extremists are using the heightened political environment as an opportunity to engage in “illegal preparatory or violent activity,” according to the DHS report. The assessment aligns with earlier WIRED reporting that indicates the paramilitary movement has been organizing and training ahead of the election. The report was first obtained by Property of the People, a nonprofit focused on transparency and national security, under open records law. “Donald Trump is yet again inciting election and immigration-related violence,\" says Ryan Shapiro, executive director of Property of the People. \"The documents make plain that many of his followers are listening.” DHS also cautioned that it is unable to get a grasp on the full scale of the threat. “We lack a complete threat picture due the ability of some DVEs to evade law enforcement using advanced encryption,” the agency wrote. And because extremists have gotten tech-savvier, intelligence officials don’t really know whether they’re joining forces. This is a trend that researchers and experts have observed especially since the Capitol riot nearly four years ago. “We’ve seen people move from mainstream platforms, where they were active in organizing January 6, and shift to platforms that offer more perceived anonymity, less moderation, and less reporting to law enforcement,” said Katherine Keneally, US director of threat analysis and prevention at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. “It is a law enforcement intelligence gap, it’s a gap for the whole field. We don’t see everything we once did.” Regardless of whether extremists are coalescing or whether the threat remains atomized, the assessment recognizes that online chatter about civil war had already inspired plans for real-world violence. In January, Justin Mohn, a 32-year-old man from Levittown, Pennsylvania, beheaded his father, a federal employee, and displayed the severed head in a 15-minute tirade uploaded online. In the video, titled “Mohn’s Militia-Call to Arms for American Patriots,” Mohn urged viewers to rise up against the government and hunt down federal agents and judges. Months later, in March, federal agents arrested Benjamin Brown, a 45-year-old man in Waterville, Maine, for making threats to kill President Biden and other officials. The man allegedly claimed he was stockpiling weapons and ammo for a civil war and, according to an affidavit, said he wanted to hunt migrants and “burn Washington to the fucking ground.” Brown was charged with making interstate threats. Then, in May, a stop for a minor traffic violation in Pekin, Illinois, led police to discover a padlocked canvas bag inside the vehicle containing a .45-caliber pistol and two homemade pipe bombs belonging to 34-year-old Dalton Mattus. When investigators searched Mattus’ home, after a brief standoff, they allegedly found more pipe bombs. A local radio station reported that Mattus told police he hoped to use the bombs defensively against “undocumented immigrants and a corrupt government.” It turned out that Mattus also had an extensive social media presence; for years, he had promoted QAnon conspiracy theories and civil war fantasies, advocated violence against federal officials, Democrats, and immigrants, and urged his followers to prepare for imminent conflict. In June, an Arizona man who worked as a vendor at gun shows was indicted for allegedly plotting a mass shooting targeting Black people at a rap concert in Atlanta with the goal of inciting a “race war” ahead of the 2024 election. According to an affidavit, Mark Adams Prieto, 58, believed that “martial law will be implemented shortly after the 2024 election.” He also said he hoped to leave confederate flags at the site of his planned mass shooting, to send the message that “we’re going to fight back now and every whitey will be the enemy across the whole country.” Also in June, 27-year-old Joseph Rose, a US veteran living on New Mexico’s White Sands Missile Range, was arrested for making threats online against Biden and federal employees. He vowed to declare war on the US and “attack federal employees on sight” over Biden’s immigration policies and said if anyone voted for Biden, “I'll shoot you on sight for supporting pedophiles.” Intelligence analysts say that they’re most concerned about lone offenders or “small cells” taking violent action in the coming months, citing the ongoing prosecutions of the January 6 rioters as well as “false flag allegations that an event is orchestrated by the government to entrap and arrest attendees” as likely deterrents to large-scale mobilization. DHS says it is continuing to advise federal, state, and local partners and urges law enforcement and the public to remain vigilant and report suspicious activity to authorities.

            "content": "It becomes very clear, shortly after Donald Trump wins Georgia, that I have made a terrible mistake. I’m sitting at home on my couch, but I’m looking around at a giant convention hall that is filled with a loud, eclectic array of human-animal hybrids—most of them with childrens’ voices. The news of Trump’s clinching of a battleground state—and his now increasingly inexorable slide into the US presidency—has just been presented to us by a cross-legged skeleton who says he is from the UK. He’s just here to hang out with the Americans on their big day. This scenario, as you may have guessed, is not taking place in the real world, but a VR realm. I have made the unenviable decision to follow one of the most important elections of our time from one of the most absurd places possible—deep in the metaverse. The room with the friendly Brit skeleton is in the virtual reality service VRChat. The VR platform is an open world with various rooms created by users to explore. Users create their own 3D avatar and interact with each other by huddling into groups and using voice chat. Unlike Meta’s Horizon Worlds platform that only works with Meta’s VR hardware, VRChat is more inclusive; the list of supported hardware includes Meta headsets, Steam headsets, and even PCs and phones. I’ve logged on using a Meta Quest 3S headset and have joined several dozen other avatar-clad people to anxiously chat through the results of the 2024 US election. The room is called Election Night 2024, made by a user with the moniker AussieGuy92. Election Night 2024 is a large virtual space that can fit up to 80 people at once, and is decorated to look like a realistic convention hall of the type where a campaign might host an election night watch party. In the lobby are signs for the Trump-Vance campaign and the Harris-Walz campaign, complete with smiling pictures of each of their presidential candidates. Inside the hall is a giant screen, rows of chairs for an audience, and large maps with each state labeled with its electoral college vote numbers. Outside, you can move onto a digital model of a city bus that will teleport you to a mock-up of the White House. Some key parts of this simulation go awry right away. First off, AussieGuy92, the user who created the space, is not even in the room most of the time, so any of the dynamic elements he could control as our host remain dormant. Despite a packed schedule of streaming videos and events listed on the walls of the building, none of that promised content is displayed on the screens inside the room. The election map doesn’t change at all throughout the night. It stays a faded gray, meaning people are on their own for gathering and sharing information about election returns. That’s why I’m grateful to the skeleton who can’t even vote in this election; he’s reading the results aloud from his phone. “There’s a good chance he’s going to win,” the skeleton says early on in the night. “I just don’t think Kamala’s got a chance to win.” There’s a pause, and then someone else asks, “So people who weren’t born in America gotta go back home?” “Yeah I guess.” The crowd in the room looks like a Second Life or Fortnite gathering that’s been mutated by some radioactive goo. I am dressed as a hot dog. My colleague Kelly Bourdet (who first introduced me to that UK skeleton) shows up in the form of a cat wearing a spacesuit. There are lots of Donald Trump look-alikes running around, lots of anime girls, and lots of knights in shiny metal armor. Batman is here being very chill. Wolverine cruises around flashing his claws at people. A giant penguin sits alone, staring into a far-off corner of the room as one fin twitches slightly. One person bulldozes through the space as an avatar that looks like a full-size, near photorealistic Taco Bell drive-through. One stomps around as a mech. Some users are pretending to kiss each other. But most of them are just arguing loudly, trolling, or using AI generated voices of Donald Trump and Joe Biden to say increasingly juvenile and, frequently, racist things. VRChat is where all the action is in this digital space. (And by action, I mean sheer chaos.) But I am eager to swap from VRChat to Meta’s Horizon Worlds, just to see what the vibe is like there. Coming from the cacophony of VRChat, the chronically underpopulated Horizon Worlds feels almost refreshing in its serenity. “We’re expecting a little bit of excitement tonight,” says one of Horizon’s community guides, the helpful moderators who greet users and offer advice to newcomers in Horizon’s entry world, Horizon Central. An avatar waves hello in Meta Horizon Worlds. Beyond that main foyer, Meta’s metaverse is less focused, or at least doesn’t have the user base to build up a flourishing political space. (A room in Horizon simply called Go Trump! has a grand total of zero people inside anytime I check throughout the day.) Horizon Worlds can be a lonely place on the best of days, but there are signs of life on election night as the population ebbs and flows. There are long lulls, broken up by the chattering of the occasional kid running by with a digital bubble gun. Then suddenly there’s a rush of people, many of them kids, some of them adults from other countries. Some of them bring up the election, some of them just stand there quietly. “We’re trying to escape it, that’s why we’re here,” one user tells me. Technology has been at the forefront of this election cycle from the start. Generative AI has driven concerns about misinformation and eye-rolling propaganda. Even the campaigns themselves embraced new-ish spaces, like the Harris-Walz-themed map in Fortnite. The metaverse may not be quite ready for the campaign cycle, but perhaps the political system should be ready for it. For all the chaos and trolling in the room on election night, what soon becomes clear is that the vibe in VR reflects the outside world. An avatar watches election returns. Trump support was strong in VRChat. The venue for the watch party. First off, the VR election rooms are overwhelmingly male, which will be unsurprising for anyone accustomed to the political manosphere in the US. Most of the people I encounter in both virtual realms seem to favor Trump, and that power imbalance only grows throughout the night as the red wave deepens and the former president’s reelection seems more and more likely. My colleague Kelly talks with a person dressed in a black Iron Man-esque suit of armor who says they are from Michigan. Ersatz Iron Man calls the state for Trump much earlier than it was officially reported. They say they know lots of people who support Trump, and for whom Elon Musk’s endorsement and posts on X were an important factor to helping Trump win more broadly. Lots of moments like this happen over the night. At first, the real-world results clash with the absurdity in the Horizon World rooms. People hiding within their brightly colored avatars, shouting over the top of each other, saying the most offensive things possibly to provoke a reaction. But then the room starts to split, a larger group on the Trump side—loud and excited. Then a smaller group on the Harris side, more somber and reflective. Some people congregate outside, talking in low voices and crunching the numbers about how many electoral votes are left. “We’ll never have a girl president,” I hear a child shout during my visit to MetDonalds, Horizon Worlds’ mockup of the fast-food chain with golden arches. “We’ve got to keep our American traditions!” “Let’s kill all the old white people in America that are around,” says somebody wearing an avatar that looks like a slinky dog from Toy Story. Then, to somebody else, “I guess if Trump wins you don’t have to worry about your school getting shot up as much I guess.” Later I watch somebody voraciously defend Trump’s policies while a different person in a knight avatar comes around behind him and starts miming rubbing his nipples while moaning loudly over the top of him. By the end of the night, it starts to feel like the virtual world is just as weird as the real one. Additional reporting by WIRED contributor Kelly Bourdet.

            "content": "As president-elect Donald Trump finished his victory speech early Wednesday morning, he gave the floor to Dana White, the Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO, to thank a group of men few in the mainstream political bubble knew before this year. “I want to thank the Nelk Boys, Adin Ross, Theo Von, Bussin' With The Boys, and last but not least, the mighty and powerful Joe Rogan,” White said. Over the final stretch of the 2024 campaign cycle, Trump went on a grand tour of podcast interviews, appearing alongside these popular influencers, streamers, and podcast hosts, and, perhaps more importantly, in front of their predominantly young male audiences. One of the Trump campaign’s most promising strategies, they believed, was to drive up the margins with medium and low propensity male voters. To do so, the campaign took Trump away from the television cameras and in front of podcast mics, setting a new standard for how to run a campaign online. “The corporate media, a lot of the mainstream media, don't know how to talk to men anymore. I think that's a big issue,” Alex Bruesewitz, a Trump campaign adviser, tells WIRED. “The messaging that comes out through the mainstream media doesn't resonate well with the average American man. And so a lot of them find their news through less traditional means.” For more than four years, political groups and campaigns have invested significant time and funds in building out vast networks of influencers to amplify their messaging online. President Joe Biden invited them to the White House for special policy briefings, and they followed him along the campaign trail until Vice President Harris took over. After Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee, her campaign was flooded with new donations. By October, they had received more than $1 billion in new fundraising, according to CBS News. The massive cash infusion gave Harris an advantage, especially in digital and traditional advertising. The Harris team outspent Trump 20 to 1 in Facebook and Instagram ad spending the week of their debate alone, according to The New York Times. To make up that difference, the Trump campaign decided to flood the zone with influencer content that cost a fraction of what traditional advertising would do. “We had to get creative on how to maximize President Trump’s exposure and this was a fun way to do that,” says Bruesewitz. While Trump dominated conservative news outlets, his influencer operation was nearly nonexistent, putting the campaign at a disadvantage. But over the course of this past year, the campaign and the Republican National Committee began integrating influencers and content creators into their election operation. Influencers were invited to the primary debates and dozens of them showed up to the Republican National Convention in July. Many of these creators exist in the manosphere, a community of men who traffic in racist and misogynistic content. Other Trump-aligned influencers who attended these events spread conspiracy theories about Harris, immigration, election fraud, and more. Trump appeared to love it; he shared posts and reveled in the attention online. “When we live in such a time as this, when there is such record distrust in the traditional media, people trust people, and influencers are people,” says CJ Pearson, cochair of the RNC’s youth advisory council. “They look to influencers to tell them what to be passionate about, what to be enraged about, what to be activated about, and then that's exactly what we wanted to do throughout this campaign.” On the ground, the Trump campaign was at a disadvantage to Harris’s massive canvassing operations. The Trump team largely outsourced its doorknocking efforts to the Elon Musk–backed America PAC and Turning Point Action. Both groups suffered from glitchy canvassing apps, and WIRED reported that canvassers for Musk’s PAC in Michigan and Arizona were subjected to harsh working conditions and what they say were impossible-to-meet quotas. Republicans in battleground states like Michigan criticized the campaign’s meager get-out-the-vote effort, fearing that it could cost them the election. But the in-person campaigning may not have mattered. Bruesewitz believes the campaign’s digital operation may have been what put them over the edge. “They all run hand in hand,” says Bruesewitz of the campaign’s online and field operations. “We were making direct contact with them at their doors and on their screens.” Hasan Piker, a popular leftist Twitch streamer, says it wasn’t only Trump’s willingness to appear on these podcasts, but also what he represented to their audiences. “Some of those guys are my friends. Others, not so much,” says Piker. “The podcasts themselves are not exactly what caused Trump to gain momentum or popularity. They played a role, for sure, in outreach, but overall, I think that he had a message that resonated with those guys, and the podcast was simply a vehicle to get to those guys.” Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist, tells WIRED that these online outreach campaigns are less effective at persuading audiences on issues than they are at rallying audiences to vote. “A lot of people misunderstand the role of influencer marketing campaigns,” he says. “It's about whether they're going to vote or not. And what we saw in some of the results is that those young men, specifically who were in that target demographic of the various podcasts and influencers, that they went out [and] swung dramatically Trump's way last night.” The next challenge, according to Wilson, is implementing influencer marketing in more localized races. “It makes sense for a national campaign. It's harder to execute for statewide campaign because, you know, the audiences get narrower and narrower,” says Wilson. “You can’t put a dollar amount on the earned media value that we got through our podcast and influencer meetups,” says Bruesewitz. “Jake Paul, whoever it may be. We were able to leverage President Trump’s personality to garner some of the most viral moments in modern history.” In your inbox: Our biggest stories, handpicked for you each day Election reaction: The manosphere won The Big Story: California will keep moving the world forward Trump's failed attempt to overthrow Venezuela's president Event: Join us for The Big Interview on December 3 in San Francisco More From WIRED Reviews and Guides © 2024 Condé Nast.

The crypto token, WLFI, went on sale at around 9 am Eastern time on Tuesday. At the time of writing, the website continues to be plagued by reliability issues, pushing some visitors to an error page. “We can’t connect to the server for this app or website at this time,” the notice states. Data from analytics platform Etherscan shows that only 8,500 people have participated in the token presale so far, purchasing around 750 million tokens—3.75 percent of the total available in the presale—between them. A World Liberty Financial representative had previously said on X that 100,000 accredited US investors had been preapproved after registering interest in the token. World Liberty Financial adviser Sandy Peng told crypto media outlet CoinDesk that the website went down due to a surge in traffic. More than 70 million unique visitors landed on the site within an hour of the token going on sale, she said. The organization did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. The website issues make it challenging to accurately assess the appetite for the WLFI token among investors. But the rocky launch will give pause to those concerned about the potential for the Trump project to set back the DeFi industry, should it fail. Since August, World Liberty Financial has been marketed by the Trump family as a way to “revolutionize finance” and “make finance great again.” The website lists presidential candidate Donald Trump as “chief crypto advocate,” and his sons—Eric, Donald Jr., and 18-year-old Barron—as “Web3 ambassadors.” The World Liberty Financial platform is set to provide peer-to-peer borrowing and lending, in the spirit of what’s known in cryptoland as decentralized finance, or DeFi. But hard details about the project have not been forthcoming. Despite making multiple announcements teasing the project on Telegram and X, and publishing a manifesto of sorts on the project’s aim, the Trumps have supplied barely any information about the workings of the platform or range of services to be available to customers. This created an opening for bad actors. In late August, impersonators used the project’s Telegram channel—pitched as “the ONLY [sic] place to get the official news”—to advertise an inauthentic token giveaway. In early September, X accounts belonging to Lara Trump, wife to Eric, and Tiffany Trump, daughter of the former president, were allegedly compromised and used by the hackers to peddle another crypto token purportedly related to World Liberty Financial. In the manifesto published on October 11, which promised to illuminate the Trumps’ “vision for revolutionizing finance” but ultimately shed little light, World Liberty Financial explained that the WLFI token will give people the ability to vote on the future development of the platform. “WLFi is also launching the WLFi governance platform, a DeFi governance platform governance [sic] for $WLFI token holders to help shape the WLFi protocol through governance,” reads one particularly bewildering passage of the post. “I think all the enthusiasm for the sale has been undone by confusing marketing,” says Nic Carter, a general partner at crypto-focused VC firm Castle Island Ventures. “The details they did release of the protocol are extremely sparse, so it doesn’t surprise me that the market hasn't responded well.” The fumbled token launch, then, is the latest in a series of mishaps and snafus to befall the World Liberty Financial project. Thanks to its affiliation with the Trump family, any mistakes have the potential to attract magnified attention from press and regulatory bodies, too. “A bigger concern is investors and regulators perhaps using any failure of the project to justify hostility to the whole crypto ecosystem,” says crypto analyst Noelle Acheson, formerly of crypto brokerage Genesis. “Most developers are working on different types of projects and shouldn’t be deterred,” she says. “But there will be more scorn heaped on crypto.” In your inbox: Upgrade your life with WIRED-tested gear A bitcoin mining dream turned into a nightmare The Big Interview: Marissa Mayer—I am a software girl I made a wholesome OnlyFans to try to make ends meet Event: Join us for The Big Interview on December 3 in San Francisco More From WIRED Reviews and Guides © 2024 Condé Nast.

            "content": "Steve Bannon got out of federal prison at around 3 am Tuesday. Seven hours later, he was live on his War Room podcast to “flood the zone with shit” exactly one week before the presidential election. Flooding the zone with shit is Bannon’s own oft-quoted description of his media strategy: churning so many lies or half-truths into the stratosphere that it becomes impossible to draw a line between fact and fiction. “I am more energized and more focused than I’ve ever been in my entire life,” said Bannon on the War Room stream on Rumble, which garnered nearly 100,000 live viewers at one point. “The four months in federal prison not only didn’t break me, it empowered me.” Bannon, 70, a longtime ally of and former strategist for Donald Trump, spent four months at a low-security federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, for contempt after he defied a subpoena in the congressional probe into the January 6 Capitol riot. Bannon has cast himself as a martyr—someone who, like January 6 rioters and like Trump, is being unfairly persecuted by the same tyrannical forces they’re up against next week in the election. On Tuesday on air, and later at a press conference, Bannon repeatedly suggested that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi banished him to prison because she wanted to contain his influence. “If you’re not prepared to be sent to federal prison as a political prisoner, then you’re not worthy to be in this movement,” he said. “You have to understand, they want to put you in prison, and they will put you in prison. If you can’t accept that, then you don’t know what they represent.” Bannon’s return to the public sphere also means the return of a massive mouthpiece to amplify the election fraud conspiracies that are already raging online. And Bannon got directly to business, spinning a tale to his viewers of Democrats plotting to heist the 2024 election. “Every day after November 5 is going to be Stalingrad,” Bannon said. “If they can’t take it away from Trump, if they can’t nullify it right there, they want to at least delegitimize his victory.” “They will go to any length to stop President Trump,” Bannon continued. “That’s the reality.” A 2023 Brookings study on disinformation in political podcasts identified Bannon’s War Room as the biggest disseminator of falsehoods and unsubstantiated claims; about a fifth of all episodes assessed by researchers were determined to have claims flagged as false by debunkers such as Snopes and Politifact. “If the Pelosi apparatus wins, you better be prepared to go to federal prison,” Bannon said. “Because these people have no qualms about weaponizing the justice system, weaponizing the legal system, against Americans who have different political views.” His fans seem to be happy he’s back. “God Bless You Steve' Get The Bannon Sledge Hammer Out, And Start Smashing The TRAITORS,” one viewer wrote during the Tuesday livestream. “Welcome back Steve, we need our leader,” wrote another. “Give us our marching orders and lets get this done.” In your inbox: Our biggest stories, handpicked for you each day Election reaction: The manosphere won The Big Story: California will keep moving the world forward Trump's failed attempt to overthrow Venezuela's president Event: Join us for The Big Interview on December 3 in San Francisco More From WIRED Reviews and Guides © 2024 Condé Nast.

            "content": "On Wednesday, the chief executives of the leading Big Tech companies congratulated the US president-elect. Sundar Pichai (Alphabet), Mark Zuckerberg (Meta), Tim Cook (Apple), Andy Jassy (Amazon), and Satya Nadella (Microsoft) have all sparred with Donald Trump before, but they were quick to get behind him as their companies face a fresh four years of operating under an influential politician who has proved volatile. Trump has shown disdain for Big Tech companies, and he’s been vocal about pursuing policies that increase the cost of doing business for Big Tech and subject them to more unfavorable regulations. Ahead of the election, business leaders and venture capitalists expressed concern that an unpredictable administration would undermine the stability of their businesses. At the same time, Trump has vowed to back out of policies that might have hobbled growth for certain tech companies. The president-elect may also take a more hands-off approach when it comes to some tech mergers and acquisitions, analysts say. And now, with Elon Musk as his biggest supporter, “this might be a moment in which there’s a picking of favorites amongst the Big Tech players,” says Betsy Cooper, director of the Aspen Policy Academy. While Trump’s tech policy positions have varied widely—and shifted often—his actions during his last presidency and his comments on the campaign trail shed light on what Big Tech might expect during a second term. One of the most closely-watched Trump proposals among the tech crowd has been his proposed import tariff, which could have a massive impact on both tech companies and consumer spending. Last year, Trump floated the idea of a 10 percent universal tariff and later proposed an additional 60 percent tariff on imports from China and up to 100 percent tariff on goods from Mexico. This has raised questions about Apple’s business—since more than 95 percent of its hardware products are manufactured and assembled in China—as well as large retailers and ecommerce companies that rely heavily on Chinese materials and components. On Monday the National Retail Federation said US shoppers could lose up to $78 billion in annual spending power if the proposed tariffs were implemented and US companies raised prices to offset their losses. Apple might be less vulnerable than an initial reading of these tariffs might suggest, equity research firm Bernstein said in a bullish note released Wednesday, because of the company’s ability to absorb higher tariffs. Apple has also been diversifying its supply chain by producing products in different regions, like Vietnam. Cooper, from the Aspen Policy Academy, notes that manufacturers already experienced disrupted supply chains during the pandemic and had to figure out how to shore up their processes. That experience could prove helpful in a high-tariff situation. Ian Bremmer, founder of political risk research firm Eurasia Group, believes that Trump’s bark might be worse than his bite: He predicts that Trump will come in high on his tariff proposals and lower the tariff rate after rounds of negotiations. This is partly because a substantial jump in the tariffs rate on China will only drive hardware manufacturers to shift their supply chains to third countries, he says, as they did during the earlier Trump administration. And, almost universally, analysts and economists say that retaliatory tariffs could hurt US businesses even more. Consistent with this theme, Trump has blasted a Biden-era bipartisan law that aimed to reduce the US’s reliance on Asia for chips and authorized more than $50 billion in spending to boost domestic supply of semiconductors. In a nearly three-hour episode of The Joe Rogan Experience in late October, Trump said the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act was “bad” because it funneled money to already-rich companies. He said the US should have imposed tariffs on foreign suppliers instead, which would, in turn, compel them to spend their own money to build chip plants in the US. He specifically criticized Taiwan, home of TSMC, a key partner for US chipmaker Nvidia, and said, “They stole our business.” (As The New York Times points out, the US is incredibly reliant on Taiwan for all sorts of chips; only about 10 percent of the world’s semiconductors are produced in the United States.) “There are countervailing pressures, with Trump being pro-US manufacturing and against the CHIPS act, and it’s still unclear which way this plays,” Cooper said. When it comes to artificial intelligence, the priority for a second Trump administration will be ensuring that the US leads the race to develop more powerful and capable AI algorithms—especially compared to its main geopolitical rival, China. The previous Trump administration sought to eliminate regulations thought to inhibit commercial tech innovation. In the era of large language models and hyperscale AI training runs, Trump might also consider providing federal resources to power the massive-scale AI projects needed to help keep American AI ahead. The strategy is also likely to involve hobbling America’s big rival. The previous Trump government introduced sanctions designed to limit Chinese AI companies' ability to do business with the US and access the chips required for building cutting-edge AI—controls that were tightened under Biden. Trump's second term could see efforts to restrain Chinese AI ramp-up, especially if a broader trade war kicks off. One of the clearest statements Trump has made about the future of AI is a promise to repeal a Biden administration executive order issued around the technology. The Biden Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence was introduced last year to place guardrails around a technology that seemed to be accelerating at a dangerous speed. Biden’s executive order implemented measures designed to limit potentially risky uses of AI, guard against bias in algorithms, and increase federal scrutiny of the most powerful models. But Trump has vowed to repeal that order, saying at a rally in Iowa last December that on “day one” he would cancel the order and “ban the use of AI to censor the speech of American citizens.” Many of the requirements of the executive order have, in actuality, been fulfilled, so repealing the order itself would have little effect. The Trump administration could, however, dismantle some of its work, which experts warn might have dangerous consequences as the technology becomes widely used. States may try to fill the void. The Center for AI Policy, a safety-focused research group that discloses little about its funding, issued a memo on Wednesday stating it expects “state-level and global action on AI regulation to accelerate in the new year in response to reduced federal oversight” and that “ironically, a prolonged absence of federal regulation may increase the total compliance burden on global AI companies.” Elon Musk’s AI rivals may also have reason to be concerned. The billionaire Trump-booster has been a frequent critic of OpenAI, which he cofounded before leaving, and of Google, accusing both companies of developing overly “woke,” politically correct AI algorithms. Musk’s desire to lead the AI race with his own company, xAI, combined with the enormous influence he might wield within the Trump administration, could make both OpenAI and Google targets, perhaps threatening their ability to secure lucrative future government contracts. A US law known as Section 230 currently prevents holding internet platforms liable for what users post and share. It has spared services such as YouTube, Facebook, and Snapchat from having to pay potentially billions of dollars in legal judgments to content creators, viewers, and parents of users who have alleged harm as a result of what they view as poor design and content moderation choices by the tech giants. Just before leaving office in his first term as president, Trump threatened to veto a significant defense spending bill unless lawmakers repealed the liability shield for tech companies. In a tweet at the time, Trump called Section 230 a “threat to our National Security & Election Integrity” and added that “Our Country can never be safe & secure if we allow it to stand.” And he didn’t bluff. He vetoed the defense bill, writing, in part, “The Act fails even to make any meaningful changes to Section 230.” But the House and Senate by wide margins overrode his veto to push through the popular bipartisan package. If Republicans have full control of Congress in Trump’s upcoming term, they could outvote Democrats to give Trump the repeal he’s wanted and open the floodgates to lawsuits. Child safety on tech platforms might also be a political topic, says Camille Carlton, senior policy manager at the Center for Humane Technology. Meta and other tech companies (including Match Group, the dating app giant) have been lobbying for the responsibility to fall on Apple and Google, who run the world’s largest app stores, to handle age verification and online safety measures. “Democrat-led states have generally emphasized platforms taking responsibility and changing the way the platforms work,” she says. “But in Republican-leading areas, we’ve seen more emphasis on parental control. So when it comes to online safety I think we’ll now see a different approach than we’ve seen so far.” Carlton notes, though, that this has mostly been a bipartisan issue and that there’s a “broad consensus that people want these platforms to design these products from the beginning in such a way that protects kids.” For TikTok, Trump represents a glimmer of hope of not getting banned in the US. While Congress has already shown its determination to ban TikTok and the courts are not expected to block it, Trump has been the rare political force that explicitly intended not to ban TikTok. On Wednesday morning, Charlie Kirk, a conservative mega-influencer, suggested to his followers in a livestream that Trump getting elected means TikTok won't be banned. The reality is less certain than that. The bill to force TikTok to either be sold or banned in the US has received bipartisan support in Congress and has already been signed into law. To undo that would mean Trump would have to convince hundreds of Republican members of Congress to take a complete 180. That's going to be very difficult, but not unimaginable in the current political landscape where Republicans coalesce around Trump. Also to bear in mind, the law laid out another possibility for TikTok: to sell its US operations to an American company and accept that it can only exist elsewhere. For Republicans, this is a win-win scenario in which Trump keeps his promise and Congress keeps its bill. In that case, the only loser—who will be most vehemently against it—will be ByteDance. On the campaign trail in 2024, Donald Trump styled himself as the “crypto president,” making a host of pledges designed to appeal to the crypto faithful. Trump had previously rejected bitcoin as a “scam.” But in July, at a conference in Nashville, Tennessee, he sang from the crypto hymn sheet. Among other pledges, Trump promised to cement the US as the foremost bitcoin mining powerhouse, establish a national bitcoin stockpile, and appoint a bitcoin advisory council if reelected. The most raucous cheers of the night were prompted by Trump’s promise to fire Gary Gensler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a regulatory agency that has brought a volley of lawsuits against crypto businesses under the Biden administration. Separately, Trump has promised to commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht, the creator of darknet marketplace Silk Road, who is currently serving life in prison. Silk Road, through which people bought and sold drugs and other contraband, was among the first online services to accept bitcoin as payment. The severity of Ulbricht’s sentence is widely considered to be disproportionate by bitcoiners, who have long called for his release. An early indicator of the relationship the Trump administration intends to have with Big Tech will be the fate of the Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan. Khan, the youngest ever FTC chair at 35, became a flashpoint in the election campaign. Among Democrat donors, her approach to antitrust enforcement and corporate power was deeply controversial. Google, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft all faced legal challenges under her tenure, although some were more successful than others. “Lina Khan is … a person who is not helping America,” LinkedIn cofounder and Democrat donor Hoffman told CNN in July. Trump donor Elon Musk also expressed his dislike. “She will be fired soon,” he said of Khan last week. Dan Ives, an analyst at financial services firm Wedbush, described Khan as a “nightmare for the tech sector,” adding there was a belief among analysts that her departure would act as a catalyst for more Big Tech deals. “The Musk influence for Trump could also catalyze and accelerate a potential Khan exit,” he said. Trump has suggested, vaguely, that “something” should be done about Google, to make the company “more fair.” Vance has been more explicit, praising Khan for “doing a pretty good job.” Vance appears to see break-ups as a solution for what he claims is Big Tech’s censorship of conservatives. “When you have companies like Facebook and Google censoring American citizens, making it harder for Americans to speak in their own political process, that is a major problem,” the vice president-elect said in September, giving Google’s acquisition of YouTube in 2006 as an example. “I do think that there should be an antitrust solution to it.” A new Trump administration is unlikely to abandon antitrust cases against Big Tech, said Adam Kovacevich, CEO of Chamber of Progress, a left-leaning technology trade group, in a memo on Wednesday, noting several of these began under his first term. “But he will likely try to use these suits as leverage over the companies to get favorable treatment on speech and content concerns.” Whether Khan would serve under Trump is unclear. Her team declined to comment on Wednesday. Bill Kovacic, a former FTC chair, said the chances of that happening beyond a few weeks were “close to zero.” Joel Khalili, Morgan Meaker, and Zeyi Yang contributed reporting.

            "content": "On September 26, 2018, Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro approached the lectern at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. Hulking and mustachioed, wearing a black suit and a bright red tie, Maduro was in a bilious mood. At home, Maduro’s political position was deteriorating. The former bus driver turned autocrat had ruled Venezuela for five years, and had recently “won” reelection in a contest widely considered to be fraudulent. But he was facing stiffer-than-expected pushback. Anti-government protests were wracking the oil-rich South American nation. Hyperinflation was obliterating its economy. More than a million Venezuelans had fled, triggering a hemispheric refugee crisis. For some time, the Trump administration had been working furiously to push Maduro—an ally of Cuba and Russia—out of power. In fact, then-president Donald Trump had even mused publicly about exercising “a possible military option, if necessary,” to deal with Venezuela. The day before Maduro’s General Assembly address, Trump stood at the same UN podium, called the situation in Venezuela a “human tragedy,” and decried the “suffering, corruption, and decay” wrought by communist and socialist regimes. The US president then announced the imposition of new sanctions against members of Maduro’s inner circle. When Maduro began his UN address, he was raring to punch back. His country was the “victim of a permanent aggression” by the “imperial” United States, he said. Venezuela’s attempt at geopolitical independence—and huge gold and petroleum reserves—had aroused the ire and avarice of the “oligarchies of the continent and those who dominate from Washington,” he added. Maduro’s harangue got darker. He claimed that a recent attempt on his life—two drones had exploded during an address he was giving outdoors in Caracas—had been masterminded by shadowy actors from within the United States. (Trump administration officials publicly denied any role in the drone attack and a dissident member of the Venezuelan army later claimed responsibility.) In recent days, Maduro had even said he was considering skipping the UN meeting altogether, because he was worried about an assassination attempt. As bitter adversaries, the Trump administration and Maduro regime didn’t agree on, well, anything. Except for the fact that the US government wanted Maduro gone. After that UN meeting, the Trump administration amped up its efforts around the world to isolate and depose the Venezuelan leader, including by levying additional punishing sanctions against his regime. Much of that diplomatic maneuvering played out in public. But the administration also put into motion another, very much secret prong to the US’s regime-change campaign: a covert CIA-run initiative to help overthrow the Venezuelan strongman. That campaign would pull off at least one disruptive digital sabotage operation against the Maduro regime in 2019. But the CIA-led initiative—alongside the Trump administration’s wider efforts to get rid of Maduro—would fall well short of its ultimate goal. The story of that secret anti-Maduro effort also lays bare the tensions between an administration with hardliners laser-focused on deposing the Venezuelan autocrat and a CIA deeply reluctant, yet nevertheless obligated, to follow White House orders. It shows the limitations of covert, CIA-assisted regime change schemes, particularly when they are not aligned with larger US foreign policy objectives. And it provides new insights into how a second Trump administration—or a Harris presidency—might still try to dislodge the Venezuelan strongman, whose latest sham reelection in July 2024 has again thrust his country into chaos. The details of that covert CIA-assisted campaign, told exclusively to WIRED by eight Trump administration and former agency officials with knowledge of the anti-Maduro operation, are reported here for the first time. On January 23, 2019, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó stood before throngs of cheering protestors at a rally in Caracas. With his right hand held aloft, he declared himself interim president of Venezuela, with the full backing from the National Assembly, the country’s highest legislative body. That day, Guaidó vowed to “reestablish the constitution”—which many believed Maduro, whose second term had begun earlier that month, had repeatedly trampled. Guaidó’s rise in 2019 helped cement US national security advisor John Bolton’s conviction that “it was time to turn the screws” on Maduro, according to Bolton’s memoir. “The revolution was on,” writes Bolton. After Guaidó’s speech, the administration recognized him as Venezuela’s rightful acting leader, and went to work lobbying other countries to do the same. (Around 60 countries would ultimately recognize Guaidó.) In late January, the Trump administration also announced its harshest Venezuela-related sanctions to date, targeting the country’s state-owned oil company and freezing billions of dollars in Venezuelan state assets. Around that time, the administration turned to the CIA to seek the agency’s help in ousting Maduro, according to former US officials familiar with the secret program. (Sources requested anonymity to discuss sensitive White House deliberations and CIA operations. The CIA declined to comment.) The CIA quickly assembled a Venezuela Task Force. That group had its work cut out for it. Before the Trump administration’s directive, Venezuela was a low priority at Langley, and capabilities had to be built from the ground up, according to the administration and former CIA officials. One of the task force’s first goals: an expansion of efforts to hack Venezuelan government networks and other infrastructure targets for intelligence-gathering purposes. Very quickly, the task force ran into roadblocks. It had to fight—sometimes unsuccessfully—for access to important resources, like elite CIA and NSA hacking teams. Those teams usually worked on higher-profile targets, according to a former agency official. In fact, when officials in the administration asked to have NSA hacking resources redirected to Venezuela, a former Trump-era official said top Pentagon officials “pushed back hard.” Ultimately, the CIA successfully carried out a disruptive strike against Maduro: a cyberattack on the state-administered payroll system used to compensate members of Venezuela’s military, according to four Trump administration and former CIA officials. The gambit, which took months for the agency to even attempt thanks to the internal struggle for resources, had been designed to push teetering Venezuelan military officials to the Guaidó camp. Former officials differ slightly in their descriptions of the payroll-related operation. Some characterize it as a remote-access cyberattack; others, as a digital sabotage operation enabled by agents on the ground. Regardless of how the cyberattack was carried out, the result was unhappy soldiers—and a risk to Maduro’s grip on power. Temporarily denying Venezuelan soldiers from receiving their paychecks was part of the administration’s goal to “exacerbate, or just further reveal, the ineptitudes of the regime,” a former national security official says. And it had some effect, says a former senior official: “There was a fair amount of grumbling about not getting paid,” the official says. “Armies march on their stomach.” The secret CIA-led campaign had other prongs too. The agency launched a covert influence campaign to spread pro-democracy content online in Venezuela, spun up a “democracy promotion” program to secretly sponsor leadership trainings, and provided support to Venezuelan civic groups, according to former US officials. But as these efforts got under way, more cracks between the administration and the CIA started to show. Trump administration officials were unimpressed by the agency’s “democracy promotion” efforts. The CIA’s secret program appeared to be indistinguishable from pro-democracy initiatives carried out openly by other government agencies like USAID, according to four former officials. It was “the most embarrassing bullshit ever,” says a former national security official—“not even sinister,” but “purely lazy.” To some Trump administration officials, the presence in Venezuela of a viable, legitimate opposition leader like Guaidó, and the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe in the country, made the CIA’s covert “pro-democracy” campaign appear farcical. “The average person has lost 25 pounds,” a former official says. “They have no food, they have no electricity, they have no jobs, they have no medicine. And we're going to tell them about democracy?” All this led some administration officials to believe that the CIA was focusing on the democracy-promotion efforts to wriggle out of conducting more hard-edged covert operations. It “was their excuse for not doing other things,” says a former US official. “I felt like they were playing with us.” “The CIA is not the Mossad. It's hunkered down, bureaucratic, and not daring … I'd like to see an intelligence community that's more capable of carrying out clandestine operations in support of American policy,” Bolton tells WIRED. (Bolton declined to comment on any specific agency activities or discussions within the Trump administration about Venezuela-related covert operations.) To some Trump-era officials, CIA executives—including CIA director Gina Haspel—were clearly opposed to the administration’s directive. Haspel “never bought into doing anything aggressive in Venezuela because she was still of the mind that we were ugly Americans,” says a senior Trump-era official. Haspel declined to comment. \"Part of the intelligence community is still traumatized by the Bay of Pigs invasion and failure. That's number one,” Bolton says. “Number two, other parts of it are still traumatized by the Obama administration view that we have no enemies in Latin America. Castro regime's OK. Chavez-Maduro regime's OK. They're not really threats. Ortega and Nicaragua was not really a threat. That wasn't my view.\" Still, administration officials continued to push the CIA and Pentagon to take combative actions. Like one that involved Cuba. Cuba relies on oil from Venezuela. In return, US officials believe, the Cuban security services have helped protect Maduro, essentially serving as an on-the-ground praetorian guard for the embattled socialist autocrat. The Trump administration thought if the US could somehow intercept or sabotage the oil ships sailing from Venezuela to Cuba, it could strike a blow against both regimes. Senior administration officials held meetings with paramilitary experts to look at the mechanics of such an operation. At least one option involved the CIA, which had a mobile system that could covertly (and nonviolently) disable ships. Trump administration officials wanted the agency to move the system near Venezuela, to hit some of its fuel tankers. The agency balked. CIA officials explained that it only had one of these systems, that it was currently in another hemisphere, and they didn’t want to move it to the northern end of South America. The idea was shelved. That wasn’t the end of it. Some administration officials lobbied for US special operators to conduct sabotage operations within Venezuela. But US intelligence and Pentagon officials were deeply opposed to having any American boots on the ground in the country. Those options were taken off the table too. At least once, Colombia stepped into the breach. The Colombians have a long history of working with CIA and Pentagon paramilitaries. Now they agreed to launch an operation inside Venezuela to disable some of the Venezuelan air force’s prized Russian-made Sukhoi fighter jets. The US provided targeting intelligence. But when the Colombian operatives carried out the sabotage, says a former senior official, the gambit was not as successful as initially hoped. The operatives were able to disable just a few of the aircraft. As the days went by, hawks like Bolton tried to keep Trump focused on ousting Maduro. The national security advisor wrote in his memoir that, in a late January 2019 phone call with the opposition leader, Trump had assured Guaidó he’d “pull off Maduro’s overthrow.” On that call Trump had also, Bolton writes, alluded to the US’s interest in Venezuela’s oil. But as various efforts plodded along, the president’s confidence in Guaidó’s team started to waver. Trump just wasn’t sure Guaidó was up for the job. In contrast to the “strong” Maduro, Trump thought Guaidó was “weak,” writes Bolton. The president began to refer to Guaidó as the “Beto O’Rourke of Venezuela.” In early March of that year, according to the memoir, Trump told Bolton, “He doesn’t have what it takes.” Bolton and his allies didn’t let up. They even developed “day after” plans for Guaidó’s ascension. A pilot program spearheaded by the US Treasury Department, known as “Venezuela Day One,” was to involve the mass distribution of preloaded debit cards, from the Spanish banking powerhouse Banco Santander, which worked closely with the administration on the initiative. The idea was to give a financial lifeline to needy Venezuelans in the immediate post-Maduro era. That plan, along with other “day after” initiatives, ended up shelved. Banco Santander declined WIRED’s request to comment. Meanwhile, fractures within the administration deepened. Even by the hawkish standards of the Trump administration, the Bolton camp’s Venezuela strategy was considered aggressive. At one point, officials created a working group focused on Venezuela. It included the CIA and the State, Treasury, and Defense departments. One group it—intentionally—did not include: Bolton and his allies on the National Security Council, says a former State Department official. The CIA “sort of thought they were dealing with Oliver North,” another official says, adding that the spy agency “reacted in an equal and opposite direction” to what they felt was Bolton’s aggressiveness by trying to avoid any operations that could cause blowback for the CIA. Schisms even opened between administration hawks. By March 2019, the security situation in Venezuela was spiraling ever-downward. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo decided to shut down the US embassy in Caracas that same month. Some administration officials believed Pompeo was primarily worried about the political fallout of presiding over “another Benghazi”—the 2012 attack by Islamist militants on US government facilities in Libya that killed four Americans, including the ambassador. “Pompeo made part of his career criticizing the Obama administration on the failures in Benghazi,” Bolton says. “And I do think that was kind of etched in his mind.\" Pompeo did not respond to requests for comment. Yet other former officials emphasized the existence of specific, credible threats of violence by the Maduro regime to embassy personnel, including to the top US diplomat in the country. (“It definitely was not a sort of middle-of-the-night Pompeo panic,” says a former State Department official. “There were direct threats that had been made.”) Whatever Pompeo’s motivations, the closure of the embassy would have major implications for US intelligence-gathering in Venezuela—and for the larger US-backed push to oust Maduro, say some former officials. It was a “disaster,” one former US official says. The US still had ways to spy on Venezuelan targets remotely. But before the embassy closure, officials in Washington would talk to important Venezuelans, taking the political temperature and coordinating potential defections from the Maduro camp; then CIA and State Department officials on the ground in the country would confirm details with these people in person. By shutting down the embassy, say Trump-era officials, US efforts to oust Maduro were dealt a big blow. “It all got screwed up in the stupidest way,” a former national security official says. Of course, much in Venezuela was outside the control of officials in Washington. The opposition was working with sympathetic regime members to lobby members of Venezuela’s high court to rule Maduro’s reelection illegitimate. It was also negotiating with powerful regime members, including Maduro’s own defense minister, to cut Maduro loose. But the opposition made some big missteps. After a bunch of delays, Guaidó’s plan to overthrow Maduro was—finally—to come together on April 30, 2019. That day, Guaidó publicly announced “Operation Liberty,” exhorting military members to defect and calling for massive street protests. Trump administration officials believed that Maduro was close to abdicating the presidency, maybe even fleeing to Cuba. Then it all fell apart. There was a lot of miscommunication and mistrust between critical players in the opposition and Maduro’s equivocating supporters. At the last minute, major Venezuelan officials backed off the ledge. Mass military desertions failed to materialize. The Venezuelan high court chickened out. The protests were a flop. Maduro, bolstered by Cuban security forces at his side, rallied his supporters. The momentum had shifted against regime change. Though the Venezuelan opposition—and the Trump administration—would limp along in their attempts to oust Maduro, the best chance had been lost. Trump administration officials found themselves “spinning the[ir] wheels for months,” says a former national security official. If the CIA had intervened more forcefully between January and April—when schisms within the military and among other Venezuelan elites were the biggest and Guaidó had the most momentum—it might have helped catalyze Maduro’s ouster, say former officials. But the agency didn’t. “As [former secretary of defense Donald] Rumsfeld once said, you go to war with the army you have,” Bolton says. “And we had a lack of capability in a number of agencies, including the intelligence community. We couldn't wait around for them to happen. So we had to do the best we could.\" “There was a handful of sabotage and cyber stuff that was done,” says a former national security official. “But it was too little, too late.” Even the one major CIA action—the digital sabotage operation that disabled the Venezuelan military payroll system—happened after the opposition began to lose momentum in 2019, according to the former official. After the payroll sabotage operation, the Venezuela Task Force began to wither. “It was kind of a one trick pony,” says a former senior agency official. CIA officials were “doing this 16 hours a day for four weeks. And then it's over—nobody gives a shit anymore,” says another former agency official. This sort of frenzied, time-compressed approach to covert action was highly unusual, this person adds. “Trump never made it enough of a priority for the rest of the national security components of the government to step up” and help overthrow the Venezuelan leader, says a former senior administration official. “Haspel,” the source says, “was absolutely not inclined to lean forward unless someone brought her into the Oval Office and said, ‘You know, you have to do this.’ And it never reached that point.” What’s more, in September 2019, Trump pushed out Bolton, the most steadfast driver of the administration’s Venezuela-related efforts. When the presidency changed hands, the Biden administration tried a different approach. In October 2023, worried about rising gasoline prices and a spiraling refugee crisis—and looking to cleave Venezuela from Russia, China, and Iran’s orbit— administration officials brokered a deal with Maduro. For agreeing to allow free and fair presidential elections in July 2024 and accepting Venezuelan refugees deported by the US, the US would ease some of the tough Trump-era sanctions on the nation’s energy sector. Maduro quickly reneged on the deal. His administration disqualified and barred leading opposition candidates from running for president, and kicked off a broad anti-democratic crackdown. Six months later, the Biden administration reimposed oil sanctions against the regime. This past July, Maduro declared victory in a vote once again marred by widespread fraud. Mass protests spread throughout Venezuela. Thousands of civilians were arrested. In August, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said there was “overwhelming evidence” that opposition candidate Edmundo González Urrutia had won the election. In September, fearing arrest or assassination, González fled to Spain. (In a recent interview, Trump called Maduro a “dictator,” but also seemed to praise the regime for what it claimed to be successful efforts to lower crime in Caracas, calling it “safer than many of our cities.”) At the moment, the authoritarian Maduro’s grip on power seems secure. But there might be a “silver lining” to all the Venezuela-focused intelligence activity prompted by the Trump administration’s anti-Maduro campaign, a former CIA official says. Before that, US spy agencies had never devoted much energy to sophisticated cyberespionage or signals intelligence collection targeting Venezuela, according to the former official. But now, this source says, US intelligence agencies have “a lot better access” to Venezuela-related intelligence. “There could be some benefit down the line.” Image Source: Getty Images In your inbox: A new series of tips for how to use AI every day Meet the masked vigilante tracking down billions in crypto scams Deep dive: This app set out to fight pesticides.

            "content": "Donald Trump picked up 15 electoral votes when he won Michigan on Election Day, another big win that helped to hand the Republican candidate his second presidential term. Both he and the Democratic nominee, US vice president Kamala Harris, spent a lot of time this fall campaigning in the critical swing state. One consequence of this electoral quirk is that the candidates have said plenty about electric cars, and dropped lots of hints about how the electric revolution might fare during their administrations. Detroit is Michigan’s largest city, the center of the American auto industry, and the spiritual home of the American auto worker. Now Trump—with the backing of at least a Republican US Senate—will retake control of the federal government, and it’s clear that his administration will take a different approach to electric vehicles than his predecessor, complicating the industry’s position as it attempts to electrify. EVs aren’t going away. But their future is much murkier than it was yesterday. The president-elect has made conflicting statements about electric vehicles. During his nomination speech in July of this year, Trump pledged to “end the electric vehicle mandate on day one,” a reference to the Biden administration's goal to convert half of all vehicle sales to EVs by 2030. The move would, Trump promised, save the US auto industry from “complete obliteration,” and slash US car prices by thousands of dollars. (EVs are by and large still more expensive than internal-combustion cars.) Trump has called federal spending on electric vehicles and their chargers a part of “the Green New scam,” a play on the US Congress' bipartisan “Green New Deal” funding package. Earlier this year, he told a Michigan audience that the industry’s emphasis on electric vehicles would make it easier for China to take over the global auto industry. But Tesla CEO Elon Musk has proved a reliable supporter, adviser, and moneyman for the president-elect. Trump, a transactional politician, seems prepared to repay him. “I’m for electric cars,” Trump said in August. “I have to be, because Elon endorsed me very strongly.” Tesla’s share price soared by 13 percent Wednesday. Then there are the positions of the conservative Heritage Foundation. The right-wing think tank’s Project 2025 transition plan has been disavowed by the Trump campaign, but it may still provide scaffolding for the administration’s policies. In a brief focused on the Department of Transportation, the organization criticized EV subsidies, including tax credits, and new fuel economy standards that attempt to reduce vehicle emissions over the next decade. It will likely prove difficult and time-consuming for Trump and his allies to undo four years of EV support. Because so many climate-related policies are enshrined in federal law, he will need help from Congress to nix them. Electric vehicle tax credits might be an easy first target. Republicans didn't like those. But the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Transportation’s stronger greenhouse gas emissions rules, finalized this year, have received support from the auto industry. Industry-friendly Republicans might not help Trump out there. Any funding for the factories that build electric vehicles and batteries that’s flowing into red states won’t easily be yanked. The Trump administration will have control over funding from the Infrastructure Act and the Inflation Reduction Act that has yet to be handed out. Targets there could include what remains of money that’s been promised for a nationwide electric vehicle charging network. Auto industry leaders will likely be affected by Trump’s promises to raise steep tariffs against foreign goods, raising the prices of foreign cars sold in the US. Automakers likely to face challenges include German firms Mercedes-Benz and BMW. Meanwhile, domestic carmakers General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis may thrive. Blue states—most notably California—will push forward in their attempts to electrify. Last time Trump was in office, his EPA attempted to rescind the waiver allowing California to set more aggressive emissions targets than the federal government. But the effort was troubled by lawsuits, and eventually, the auto industry itself, which struck deals with California to allow its ambitious emission policies to continue. Industry analysts, meanwhile, expect officials in the Biden administration to hustle to finalize important EV-friendly regulations even before the current president leaves the White House. The US Environmental Protection Agency, for example, is expected to finalize a waiver that will allow California to move forward with its plan to ban gas-powered car sales by 2035. California is one of the largest auto markets in the country, and other states have proven eager to follow the state’s zero-emissions lead. The Biden administration put the auto industry at the center of its new approach to domestic policy. It passed laws creating new tax credits for electric vehicle buyers, and sent billions to companies building EVs and the public infrastructure that will keep them charged up. Under Biden, the EPA also finalized new and more aggressive caps on tailpipe emissions, which will gradually require the auto industry to pump out more gas-efficient vehicles and combat air pollution. Biden has also struck a stronger pose against the threat of the Chinese auto industry, which is exporting a steady stream of affordable EVs overseas, mostly to nations in South America, Europe, and the Middle East. The administration placed an unprecedented 100 percent tariff on Chinese-made vehicles, and is in the process of finalizing a rule that would bar advanced Chinese and Russian auto tech from the US—effectively banning Chinese cars from the US. Trump has promised to intensify the United States’ hostile trade position towards China. Automakers don’t want EVs to be political. Earlier this summer, Ford CEO Jim Farley tried to insist that politics have no place in electric car making. “The tipping point we’re working toward will come not from regulators who push us or from politicians who try to hold us back. It will come from consumers,” he wrote on LinkedIn, where he posts frequently. But whether Ford and its ilk can avoid those regulators and politicians is an open question. Meanwhile, buyers will continue to determine the future of EVs at the dealership.

            "content": "Jake Sullivan was standing in the middle of his office, which occupies an airy, sunlit corner of the West Wing, looking like he didn’t quite know what to do with his hands. He was taking me on a perfunctory three-minute tour of the space, even though the office tour is, perhaps, the most tired trope of the magazine profile—and, I’d been warned, Sullivan is not a fan of magazine profiles. At least, not the ones that are about him. The White House national security adviser is a most serious person and, by most accounts, always has been—a Minnesota kid who had memorized world capitals before the age of 14 and, by 35, had traveled to 112 of those countries as then secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s close adviser. A former Rhodes Scholar and world-class debater, he deftly swats away questions he dislikes by challenging their premise and speaks in polished paragraphs, not unlike his old boss, President Barack Obama. One White House official I spoke to described Sullivan as having a “relentless mind.” The pageantry of the magazine profile—the part where reporters read too much into whatever the subject is drinking or wearing, which in Sullivan’s case is almost always a slightly oversize black suit with a limited rotation of solid, wide ties—can seem a little fluffy for someone who has so carefully cultivated a reputation for depth and substance. So as he walked me around the room that afternoon in May, gamely humoring me in a bit of high-speed show-and-tell, even I cringed a bit. The next day, he was headed to Saudi Arabia to discuss a pathway to Middle East peace with the Crown Prince, but had I seen the photo of the old shed behind the house where he grew up? In defense of this particular office tour, I was there not for color but to scope out one specific item I’d heard about before coming to meet Sullivan. Tucked up on a corner bookshelf, there it was: a small patch of white fabric embroidered with three red arrows in the center, encased in a simple square frame. It was a gift Sullivan had made for his counterparts from Japan and the Netherlands in preparation for a high-stakes, hush-hush meeting in Washington last January. The arrows were a nod to an old Japanese parable, in which a father teaches his three sons a lesson by handing each of them an arrow and instructing them to break it. One by one, the arrows snap. Next, he ties three new arrows together and tells them to try again. Bound together, the arrows hold firm. Strength, the story teaches, comes from unity. Sullivan trusted his guests to grasp the message as they met to orchestrate their own quiet show of solidarity: a plan to keep the world’s most advanced semiconductors and the machines that make them out of China’s hands. The meeting was part of a tectonic shift for America’s China policy that began under the Trump administration. But it was also a shift for Sullivan, who had once subscribed to the mainstream belief that free trade with China was the way to seed peace and prosperity in the world. He had since been disabused of that notion. Under President Xi Jinping, China had used advanced chips from the US to power supercomputers that surveilled Muslim minorities and trained AI systems that could enhance its military capabilities. At the same time, the Chinese armed forces had conspicuously expanded its military drills off the coast of Taiwan, which produces most of the world’s advanced semiconductors. If China were to invade the island, as US intelligence predicted it could be ready to do by 2027, it could create a catastrophic chip shortage, impacting everything from smartphones to medical devices to weaponry. The Chinese government had made no secret of its interest in replacing the US as a technological superpower. Preventing that scenario had become one of Sullivan’s top priorities. He couldn’t do it alone. While American firms such as Nvidia design the most powerful chips in the world, those chips—called graphics processing units—are made on the back of a vast and interconnected global supply chain. Much of the equipment in Taiwanese semiconductor factories comes from the Netherlands, Japan, and the United States. The US had already begun blocking its most advanced chips from being exported to China. But like the proverbial lone arrow, those controls would all break down if China could still buy the machinery to make chips elsewhere. “Government’s hard,” Sullivan says about how the job has changed him. “So you just become hard.” Over the course of several hours, sitting inside a meeting room at Blair House, the two-century-old DC townhome where foreign dignitaries stay on official business, the three men ironed out the precise contours of each country’s controls, finalizing what would be included and how long they would have to act. By the time they left, they had a firm understanding in place—and Sullivan’s gift, as a reminder of the costs of backing out. None of the officials involved in the meeting have ever spoken publicly about their discussions, and Sullivan was not about to when I asked him about it during my visit. But it wasn’t hard to see why he keeps this particular item on display—or why a person as wary of magazine profiles as Sullivan actually agreed to this one. That fabric swatch represents a big part of what he’s set out to accomplish in this office and what he’ll leave behind when it’s time to move out. Even before President Joe Biden announced he was stepping back from the presidential race, the odds of Sullivan sticking around for another term seemed slim. Already, he is poised to be the longest serving national security adviser in nearly 20 years. None of his predecessors since Henry Kissinger has ever lasted much longer than one term. None of former President Donald Trump's national security advisers made it past two years. When the history of the Biden administration gets written, the compounding crises of the past four years—the pandemic, the calamitous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine—will feature prominently. But the technology competition with China will, too. It’s a mission Sullivan views in both existential and personal terms. “If technology is being used more for ill than for good, if the rules of the road are being set by authoritarian competitors, if the technologies of the future are invented elsewhere and not here, that’s going to mean less security, less jobs, and less productivity in the United States,” he told me. “I don’t want to see that world.” It’s a neat, flag-waving narrative, but the reality, of course, is more complicated. Some fear that in isolating China, the US will only accelerate the development of China’s own, homegrown technologies. Others worry that in its haste to stand up to one authoritarian regime, the US has wound up courting others. Sullivan’s revolution is premised in part on the idea that closer economic ties to new global partners might nudge the world toward a shared set of values: democracy, justice, and human rights. But that’s not altogether unlike the bet that the United States once made on China—the same losing wager Sullivan has been trying to win back. Sullivan grew up in Minneapolis as one of five siblings in a big Irish-Catholic household. His dad worked in the newspaper industry, his mom a school counselor, and the two of them instilled in their children a curiosity about the world. As Sullivan once told the MinnPost, his parents kept a globe on the kitchen table, which they’d use as inspiration for dinnertime lessons in geopolitics. This being the 1980s, there was a lot to talk about China opening up to the world market, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Soviet Union collapsing, new democracies sprouting up all over the planet. (Not coincidentally, Sullivan’s younger brother would also go on to be a senior adviser to Secretary of State Antony Blinken.) In high school, Sullivan was voted “most likely to succeed.” A former teacher described him in the school newspaper as “one of the most intense students I have ever had in class.” Later, he boomeranged from Yale to a Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford and back to Yale for law school, collecting accolades along the way as a competitive debater. The accomplishments kept coming: a Supreme Court clerkship, a stint as chief counsel to Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, a role on Hillary Clinton’s 2008 primary campaign, then Barack Obama’s. He became the youngest director of policy planning in State Department history, and when Secretary Clinton needed someone to begin secret talks that would lead to the Iran nuclear deal, Sullivan was one of the people she tapped for the job. By 2013, President Obama himself poached Sullivan to work in the White House as then vice president Biden’s national security adviser. He was 36. There were times when even Sullivan—who, despite his gravitas, occasionally dips into Midwestern aw-shucksisms—couldn’t believe the life he was living. His first time in the Situation Room, he has said, he felt like there had to be “another room down the hall” where the real decisions got made. “And then you realize there isn’t another room,” he said. “There’s only us.” During the Obama years, Sullivan was known for his upbeat and even disposition—at a going-away party for him at State, he was tagged with the moniker “Mr. Sunshine.” He had an almost Socratic approach to navigating disagreements. Without ever raising his voice, he would turn over counterarguments until every logical flaw had been exposed and probe his sparring partners with respectful but incisive questions. Jennifer Harris, then a policy planner at State, said she would often share with Sullivan what were, at the time, “heretical” views about free trade and globalization. For decades, the mainstream policy wonks had said it was best for governments to take a hands-off approach to global trade—let the invisible hand balance the scales. But Harris was watching China hollow out US industries by plowing money and stolen American IP into homegrown competitors. The US government, Harris argued, needed to hit back. Sullivan was one of the few people in the administration who would actually hear her out. Then, Harris recalled, he’d ask her for reading assignments. “He really worries about blind spots,” she said. But if Sullivan was open to rethinking free trade, he hadn’t yet fully embraced Harris’ arguments. When Clinton ran for president in the 2016 election, Sullivan joined her on the campaign trail, talking up the merits of the “liberal international order” and open markets. Pundits predicted he would become the youngest national security adviser in history when Clinton took office. But voters had a different plan. The morning after Trump’s victory, looking drawn and despondent, Sullivan sat between Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, and Huma Abedin, her closest aide, as Clinton delivered her concession speech. Sullivan balks at the suggestion that the Trump years were some period of soul-searching for him (“that’s pretty existential for an Irish guy”), but he did process Clinton’s loss in his own way. From a new perch at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace—one of many hats he wore during this time—he researched, conducted interviews, and wrote extensively. Sullivan came to realize that he’d had a blind spot—a big one. Somewhere along the line, he and the rest of the Washington foreign policy establishment had failed to effectively make the case for how decades of globalism benefited the average American. Perhaps worse, they’d failed to really grapple with the ways in which it didn’t benefit regular people at all. Donald Trump had made that case, however sloppily. A former star debater, Sullivan is known for his Socratic approach to navigating disagreements. Sullivan’s blind spot wasn’t just about economics. While the US was shipping jobs and industries overseas, it was also providing China open access to sensitive technologies. It didn’t take a Rhodes scholar to see the problem. “If you ask someone where I grew up, ‘Hey, do you think we should give computer chips for use in Chinese nuclear weapons?’ They will be like, ‘No,’” Sullivan told me. “Somehow, we missed out on the common sense proposition.” By the time he joined Biden’s campaign for president in 2020, Sullivan believed securing the United States’ lead in emerging technologies was the clearest path to creating American jobs and fending off China’s competitive threat. As it turned out, it was also good politics. The Biden administration was only six months old when its national security adviser—Sullivan—announced his intention to lead a revolution. He was standing behind a podium in a gilded ballroom inside DC’s historic Mayflower Hotel while hundreds of tech executives and government officials sipped coffee and boxed water at white-linened tables. The Brandenburg Gate this was not. Sullivan began his remarks with a brief history of the past few decades of technological development. As he described it, that history could be broken up into two waves: the first, when the proliferation of the internet looked like it would be a democratizing force for the world, and the second, when authoritarian regimes used those same tools to spy on, harass, and suppress billions of people. During that second wave, China didn’t just create a vast censorship and surveillance network, Sullivan said; it also began investing heavily in the “hard infrastructure,” like semiconductor manufacturing, that the US had for too long taken for granted. If the US and its friends didn’t band together and act, Sullivan warned, the outlook would “grow darker.” What the world needed was a third wave, one shaped by US leadership. “The question before us today is whether we have the will and determination to usher in that third wave,” Sullivan said. “Whether we can reboot and ensure that critical and emerging technologies work for, not against, our democracies and our security.” Mr. Sunshine was fast becoming one of the Biden administration’s weariest warriors. At the White House, Sullivan had already set up a new directorate at the National Security Council focused on advanced chips, quantum computing, and other cutting-edge tech. If the US was to get serious about competing with China, there needed to be a team at the NSC actually dedicated to that, just as there were teams dedicated to counterterrorism and climate change. Otherwise, the whole project risked getting swallowed up by other crises. And there were many. A month after Sullivan issued his call for a digital revolution, the Taliban seized control of Kabul. The US was in the middle of withdrawing from its 20-year war in Afghanistan, and Sullivan was in the Situation Room with the president just over a week later when he got word of a suicide bombing just outside the airport where Afghan refugees were being evacuated. The attack killed 183 people, including 13 US service members. Sullivan bore the brunt of the blame. Then, in September, US intelligence officials picked up on a major Russian military exercise along the Ukrainian border, a preview of the invasion to come, which has occupied a significant portion of Sullivan’s time every day since. All of it exacted a toll on Sullivan, sharpening his elbows ever so slightly and darkening the circles under his sleepless eyes. Mr. Sunshine was fast becoming one of the Biden administration’s weariest warriors. He still preferred to win an argument on the merits, but as he once told an administration official, he was learning that when people pound on the table and yell, sometimes “you’ve got to pound on the table and yell right back.” It was a gradual transformation that even Sullivan noticed in himself. “Government’s hard,” he told me. “So you just become hard.” But Sullivan never took his eye off China. To lead the new NSC office on emerging tech, he had tapped Tarun Chhabra, a former Obama NSC official who had spent the Trump years at leading think tanks, writing about how the US and its allies could secure an advantage over China’s growing technological reach. Sullivan and Chhabra used that work as a blueprint for their own to-do list, which Sullivan monitored fastidiously. “What I find with Jake is that, while there could be crisis moments where he’s 100 percent absorbed,” Chhabra said, “he’s always coming to us saying, ‘What are we doing about this piece of reporting on semiconductors?’” In his office, Sullivan keeps a white board filled with his biggest priorities, which are constantly shifting along with world events. “There was always a line for China, and tech competition was one of the bullets under China,” said Peter Harrell, former senior director for international economics at the NSC and the National Economic Council. “It was the one thing that never got taken off.” One of the first big wins in the Biden administration’s tech agenda was getting the CHIPS and Science Act through Congress. The bipartisan bill allocated, among other things, more than $52 billion for domestic semiconductor manufacturing—including $39 billion worth of funding for dozens of new and modernized chip facilities across the country. President Biden signed it in a triumphant ceremony on the South Lawn in August 2022. “The United States must lead the world in the production of these advanced chips,” the president said. “This law will do exactly that.” But even as Congress was working on boosting the US semiconductor sector through the CHIPS Act, Sullivan and Chhabra—along with a key partner in Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo—were closing in on a plan to cripple China’s. One unlikely inspiration for this work was the Trump administration. In 2019, it added the Chinese telecom giant Huawei—which the administration believed was a conduit to the Chinese government—to the Commerce Department’s entity list. That move essentially blocked US companies from doing business with Huawei altogether. Then, in 2020, Trump officials went a step further by invoking what had been an obscure regulation called the foreign direct product rule. Huawei was prohibited from accessing not only American companies’ chips but also any foreign chips that had been made with American technology or software, which is to say, effectively all of them. The Biden administration was now eyeing a massive expansion of that model, creating a vast and unprecedented blockade that would prevent the most powerful chips designed by Nvidia and AMD from reaching Chinese supercomputers. But it was clear from the start that the US needed allies on board. Over the course of 2022, as the US was hammering out the details of its own controls, Sullivan was quietly discussing a parallel set of controls over secure calls with his counterparts in the Netherlands and Japan. One focal point of those discussions was the Dutch firm ASML, which is the only company in the world that makes the extreme ultraviolet lithography machines used to etch microscopic patterns into leading-edge chips. The Trump administration had already pressured the Dutch government to restrict Chinese licenses on those EUV machines—its most advanced technology. Sullivan wanted to expand the restrictions even further, to ASML’s deep ultraviolet lithography machines, which are less precise, but still powerful. Harrell, who worked with Sullivan and Chhabra on the US export controls, said Sullivan’s direct involvement in conversations like these was key. “The US government asks our allies and partners to do lots and lots of things,” he said. “Hearing about something in a sustained way from the national security adviser really signals seriousness.” While both countries understood the risks of China’s growing technological and military capabilities, they were also wary of cutting too far into their industries’ market share or facing Beijing’s wrath. To get any deal over the edge, Harrell said, it was sometimes “easier, and indeed necessary, for the US to act first.” In October 2022, the Commerce Department forged ahead with its new export controls, a moment that was seen in some circles as a dramatic escalation in a second cold war. China accused the US of trying to “maintain its sci-tech hegemony” and issued restrictions in retaliation. But in stepping out on a limb, the US also gave its allies cover to follow. Not that they had much choice: The far-reaching controls constrained any company in the world whose technology required US components, software, or workers to build. So when the Dutch and Japanese officials walked into Blair House to meet with Sullivan the following January, they were ostensibly there to finalize a mutual agreement. But the United States had left scarce room for negotiation. As Rem Korteweg, a leading Dutch foreign policy researcher, told me, “It wasn’t a conversation among equals.” The Dutch and the Japanese would go on to unveil their own sweeping controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment, including ASML’s DUV machines and almost two dozen tools produced in Japan. Both countries have sworn ever since that they were acting in their own—very real—national security interests. (A spokesperson for the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs said much the same thing to WIRED, and Japan’s foreign ministry didn’t respond to requests for comment.) But to anyone paying attention, Sullivan’s influence was obvious. Just a few days after the Blair House meeting, Sullivan was down the road, sitting inside yet another storied Washington, DC, institution—this time, the US Chamber of Commerce. The building's intricate interior murals commemorate renowned explorers responsible for breakthroughs in global trade. Now Sullivan was also trying to chart new territory. Seated just a few feet away from him was Indian national security adviser Ajit Doval. Nicknamed the James Bond of India, Doval is a mustached former spy nearly twice Sullivan’s age, but the two men had struck up an unexpectedly close relationship over the course of the Biden years. This meeting, the kickoff event for a new tech partnership between the US and India, was a product of their bond. If the first prong of the Biden tech agenda was all about protecting sensitive technologies from reaching China, the second was about promoting the US tech ecosystem just about everywhere else. The Biden administration saw India as a top prospect. It is the world’s largest democracy, and as China’s next-door neighbor, has actually battled the Chinese military over disputes along the border. What better partner to resist President Xi’s half-concealed threats about an inevitable “reunification” with Taiwan? At the Chamber of Commerce, senior officials from both countries and top tech executives gathered at long tables configured into a giant square. Together, they brainstormed how to break down the old trade barriers that still stood in the way of closer collaboration. Sullivan encouraged the group to think big, saying ​​he wanted “a list of firsts.” By the time Indian prime minister Narendra Modi traveled to Washington for a state visit five months later, the White House was ready to roll out that list, including collaborations in Micron semiconductor assembly, GE jet engine production, and even NASA space missions. “On the issues that matter most and that will define the future,” President Biden said in a joint press conference with Modi, “our nations look to one another.” Sullivan’s pursuit of tech partnerships with countries like India and Vietnam has also drawn criticism, thanks to those countries’ less than stellar records on internet freedoms. But this moment of solidarity between two old Cold War adversaries masked a messy tangle of compromises. Even as the US was touting India as a key partner in building the technologies of the future, its government was steadily abusing technologies of today. Under Modi’s leadership, India has amended laws to increase online censorship, led the world in internet shutdowns since 2016, and allegedly used spyware in attempts to hack journalists and dissidents. There was little evidence that the White House’s overtures to Modi’s government had any moderating effect on these authoritarian tendencies. “If anything, India has continued to move in a direction that’s against US foreign policy interests with respect to tech,” said Jason Pielemeier, a former State Department special adviser and the current executive director of the nonprofit Global Network Initiative, which works on digital rights issues. About a week after Modi’s visit, in fact, Czech authorities arrested a man who was allegedly hired by an Indian government employee to orchestrate the assassination of a US citizen in New York. The target of the alleged plot had been a vocal critic of Modi’s government. The Washington Post later reported that the scheme was allegedly directed by India’s spy service, which is ultimately overseen by Doval. (Charges have not been filed against any other individuals. The Indian government called allegations connecting the plot to government officials “unwarranted and unsubstantiated” but has been conducting an ongoing investigation into the matter.) “We’re not going to turn away the opportunity to work with countries who don’t share our values on everything.” The White House expressed concerns about the allegations but mostly handled those concerns quietly, drawing accusations that the United States’ strengthened ties to India had also tied its hands. When I asked Sullivan about this critique, he trained his eyes on me in rebuke. “I think it’s worth reversing that question and saying, What does India feel it has to do in response to the uncovering of that plot because of its investment in the relationship with the United States?” he said. A relationship doesn’t have to be a trap, he argued. It can also be an opportunity to have a more constructive conversation when things go wrong. Besides, Sullivan argued, India is still a democracy, and the nice thing about democracies is that the people actually get to decide who they want in power and what policies they want to support. That, Sullivan said, is a far more effective way of enacting change than for the US to go around wagging its finger at other governments, “particularly given the fact that we’ve got plenty of work to do with respect to our own democracy.” Sullivan has continued launching tech partnerships with other governments, and they’ve almost all come with similar trade-offs. Vietnam ranks among the worst countries in the world for digital freedom, with a “bamboo firewall” that emulates China’s internet censorship regime and a nasty habit of arresting activists who speak out against the government online. Yet last year, the White House struck a new deal to help develop the semiconductor ecosystem in Vietnam—a partnership that proved key to persuading Hanoi to officially recognize the United States as one of its top diplomatic partners. It was a bureaucratic move in an arcane system, but it was a historic victory for Sullivan. Russia and China were already some of Vietnam's closest friends. Now, the US was one, too. “Jake said: Put technology on the table. Let’s make sure that they understand what we might be able to do together in 5G and in semiconductors,” said Kurt Campbell, the current deputy secretary of state, who helped negotiate the Vietnam partnership while he was working at the NSC. The prospect of greater technological collaboration was, Campbell said, “the great differentiator.” Sullivan similarly helped pave the way to a $1.5 billion investment deal that went through earlier this year between Microsoft and the Abu Dhabi–based AI giant G42. The company, which is chaired by Sullivan’s Emirati counterpart, was believed to have built part of its technical stack on top of Huawei technology. Though the White House didn’t directly engineer the deal, Sullivan did make clear that no deal with any US company would be possible unless G42 cut its ties to China. The ultimatum worked. Microsoft president Brad Smith, who led the G42 deal, said he believes Sullivan has crafted perhaps the most comprehensive technology and national security strategy in US history, one that acknowledges the importance of pulling new parts of the world into the United States’ orbit. “Each country has a strong incentive to win over as much of the world as it can,” Smith said of the race between the US and China, “but you cannot win over the world unless you take your technology to the countries you’re trying to enlist on your side.” But the UAE’s track record on using tech as a tool of repression is also bleak. Sullivan acknowledges there’s a “healthy debate” about which countries belong under the US tent. “We could say: We won’t work with any country other than, basically, NATO and Japan, Korea, and Australia. But essentially, at that point, you’re writing off a huge amount of the world with all its capacity, resources, energy, and ambition,” he said. “We’re not going to turn away the opportunity to work with countries who don’t share our values on everything.” It’s not just who Sullivan is working with that has stoked debate, but what he’s ultimately working to achieve. Not everyone is convinced that China having access to advanced chips is the grave national security threat that Sullivan and the Biden administration claim. There are also plenty of people, even some close to Sullivan, who remain skeptical of the idea that the US tech sector is somehow innately more virtuous than China’s. “I totally agree with a policy that enables the US to lead the third technological revolution, so long as we remember that American dominance of something doesn’t necessarily lead to the best outcomes,” said former US representative Tom Malinowski from New Jersey, who worked with Sullivan when he was Washington director for Human Rights Watch. Malinowski attended Sullivan’s 2015 wedding to Maggie Goodlander, a former adviser to senators Joe Lieberman and John McCain. In a group photo of the big day, Malinowski’s face peeks out just between the bride and groom, who stand beaming beside Secretary Clinton. When I relayed Malinowski’s critique to Sullivan, he responded with a sheepish laugh. “Thanks, Tom.” He conceded his old friend made a fair point and rattled off a list of ways the Biden administration has sought to keep American tech giants in check. “But let’s be real,” he said. “We have challenges with American tech, to be sure. But if the world were dominated by Chinese or Russian or Iranian tech, those problems would be infinitely worse.” In a phone call with President Biden this past spring, Xi Jinping warned that if the US continued trying to stall China’s technological development, he would not “sit back and watch.” And he hasn’t. Already, China has answered the US export controls—and its corresponding deals with other countries—by imposing its own restrictions on critical minerals used to make semiconductors and by hoovering up older chips and manufacturing equipment it is still allowed to buy. For the past several quarters, in fact, China was the top customer for ASML and a number of Japanese chip companies. A robust black market for banned chips has also emerged in China. According to a recent New York Times investigation, some of the Chinese companies that have been barred from accessing American chips through US export controls have set up new corporations to evade those bans. (These companies have claimed no connection to the ones who’ve been banned.) This has reportedly enabled Chinese entities with ties to the military to obtain small amounts of Nvidia’s high-powered chips. Nvidia, meanwhile, has responded to the US actions by developing new China-specific chips that don’t run afoul of the US controls but don't exactly thrill the Biden administration either. For the White House and Commerce Department, keeping pace with all of these workarounds has been a constant game of cat and mouse. In 2023, the US introduced the first round of updates to its export controls. This September, it released another—an announcement that was quickly followed by a similar expansion of controls by the Dutch. “We are building something that is not political and partisan,” says Sullivan, and some of his work will endure regardless of who wins the 2024 election. Some observers have speculated that the Biden administration’s actions have only made China more determined to invest in its advanced tech sector. And there’s clearly some truth to that. But it’s also true that China has been trying to become self-sufficient since long before Biden entered office. Since 2014, it has plowed nearly $100 billion into its domestic chip sector. “That was the world we walked into,” Sullivan said. “Not the world we created through our export controls.” The United States’ actions, he argues, have only made accomplishing that mission that much tougher and costlier for Beijing. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger estimated earlier this year that there’s a “10-year gap” between the most powerful chips being made by Chinese chipmakers like SMIC and the ones Intel and Nvidia are working on, thanks in part to the export controls. If the measure of Sullivan’s success is how effectively the United States has constrained China’s advancement, it’s hard to argue with the evidence. “It’s probably one of the biggest achievements of the entire Biden administration,” said Martijn Rasser, managing director of Datenna, a leading intelligence firm focused on China. Rasser said the impact of the US export controls alone “will endure for decades.” But if you’re judging Sullivan’s success by his more idealistic promises regarding the future of technology—the idea that the US can usher in an era of progress dominated by democratic values—well, that’s a far tougher test. In many ways, the world, and the way advanced technologies are poised to shape it, feels more unsettled than ever. Four years was always going to be too short for Sullivan to deliver on that promise. The question is whether whoever’s sitting in Sullivan’s seat next will pick up where he left off. Sullivan, for one, isn’t saying what his plans are for next year, but at least one new role seems secure: His wife is heavily favored to win a House seat in New Hampshire, which would, at the very least, make Sullivan a particularly prominent congressional spouse. When I asked Sullivan what would happen to all of his outstanding bets if, indeed, someone else were in his shoes next year, he didn’t bother to push back. Instead he said he believed they would still pay off. “We are building something that is not political and partisan,” he said, and “therefore has a really good chance of being embedded as a durable part of US foreign policy going forward.” It was the only answer someone in his position could give, but there may be some truth to it yet. While campaigning for president, Vice President Kamala Harris said US–China policy should be about “making sure the United States of America wins the competition for the 21st century.” And it was the Trump administration that kicked off the trade war with China that Sullivan built upon, albeit with a far more isolationist approach than Sullivan’s. Some of the work Sullivan started internationally—be it persuading other countries to institute their own export controls or paving the way to deals between multinational tech giants—won’t be easily undone. In so many ways, the past four years have bound these global players together. The next four will test whether that has really made them stronger. Let us know what you think about this article.

            "content": "A $2 million contract that United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement signed with Israeli commercial spyware vendor Paragon Solutions has been paused and placed under compliance review, WIRED has learned. The White House’s scrutiny of the contract marks the first test of the Biden administration’s executive order restricting the government’s use of spyware. The one-year contract between Paragon’s US subsidiary in Chantilly, Virginia, and ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Division 3 was signed on September 27 and first reported by WIRED on October 1. A few days later, on October 8, HSI issued a stop-work order for the award “to review and verify compliance with Executive Order 14093,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson tells WIRED. The executive order signed by President Joe Biden in March 2023 aims to restrict the US government’s use of commercial spyware technology while promoting its “responsible use” that aligns with the protection of human rights. DHS did not confirm whether the contract, which says it covers a “fully configured proprietary solution including license, hardware, warranty, maintenance, and training,” includes the deployment of Paragon’s flagship product, Graphite, a powerful spyware tool that reportedly extracts data primarily from cloud backups. “We immediately engaged the leadership at DHS and worked very collaboratively together to understand exactly what was put in place, what the scope of this contract was, and whether or not it adhered to the procedures and requirements of the executive order,” a senior US administration official with first-hand knowledge of the workings of the executive order tells WIRED. The official requested anonymity to speak candidly about the White House’s review of the ICE contract. Paragon Solutions did not respond to WIRED's request to comment on the contract's review. The process laid out in the executive order requires a robust review of the due diligence regarding both the vendor and the tool, to see whether any concerns, such as counterintelligence, security, and improper use risks, arise. It also stipulates that an agency may not make operational use of the commercial spyware until at least seven days after providing this information to the White House or until the president's national security adviser consents. “Ultimately, there will have to be a determination made by the leadership of the department. The outcome may be—based on the information and the facts that we have—that this particular vendor and tool does not spur a violation of the requirements in the executive order,” the senior official says. While publicly available details of ICE’s contract with Paragon are relatively sparse, its existence alone raised alarms among civil liberties groups, with the nonprofit watchdog Human Rights Watch saying in a statement that “giving ICE access to spyware risks exacerbating” the department’s problematic practices. HRW also questioned what it calls the Biden administration’s “piecemeal approach” to spyware regulation. The level of seriousness with which the US government approaches the compliance review of the Paragon contract will influence international trust in the executive order, experts say. “We know the dangers mercenary spyware poses when sold to dictatorships, but there is also plenty of evidence of harms in democracies,” says John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab who has been instrumental in exposing spyware-related abuses. “This is why oversight, transparency, and accountability around any US agency attempt to acquire these tools is essential.” International efforts to rein in commercial spyware are gathering pace. On October 11, during the 57th session of the Human Rights Council, United Nation member states reached a consensus to adopt language acknowledging the threat that the misuse of commercial spyware poses to democratic values, as well as the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. “This is an important norm setting, especially for countries who claim to be democracies,” says Natalia Krapiva, senior tech-legal counsel at international nonprofit Access Now. Although the US is leading global efforts to combat spyware through its executive order, trade and visa restrictions, and sanctions, the European Union has been more lenient. Only 11 of the 27 EU member states have joined the US-led initiative stipulated in the “Joint Statement on Efforts to Counter the Proliferation and Misuse of Commercial Spyware,” which now counts 21 signatories, including Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, Japan, and South Korea. “An unregulated market is both a threat to the citizens of those countries, but also to those governments, and I think that increasingly our hope is that there is a recognition [in the EU] of that as well,” the senior US administration official tells WIRED. The European Commission published on October 16 new guidelines on the export of cyber-surveillance items, including spyware; however, it has yet to respond to the EU Parliament's call to draft a legislative proposal or admonish countries for their misuse of the technology. While Poland launched an inquiry into the previous government’s spyware use earlier this year, a probe in Spain over the use of spyware against Spanish politicians has so far led to no accusations against those involved, and one in Greece has cleared government agencies of any wrongdoing. “Europe is in the midst of a mercenary spyware crisis,” says Scott-Railton. “I have looked on with puzzled wonderment as European institutions and governments fail to address this issue at scale, even though there are domestic and export-related international issues.” With the executive order, the US focuses on its national security and foreign policy interests in the deployment of the technology in accordance with human rights and the rule of law, as well as mitigating counterintelligence risks (e.g. the targeting of US officials). Europe—though it acknowledges the foreign policy dimension—has so far primarily concentrated on human rights considerations rather than counterintelligence and national security threats. Such a threat became apparent in August, when Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) found that Russian government hackers were using exploits made by spyware companies NSO Group and Intellexa. Meanwhile, Access Now and Citizen Lab speculated in May that Estonia may have been behind the hacking of exiled Russian journalists, dissidents, and others with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. “In an attempt to protect themselves from Russia, some European countries are using the same tools against the same people that Russia is targeting,” says Access Now’s Krapiva. “By having easier access to this kind of vulnerabilities, because they are then sold on the black market, Russia is able to purchase them in the end.” “It’s a huge mess,” she adds. “By attempting to protect national security, they actually undermine it in many ways.” Citizen Lab’s Scott-Railton believes these developments should raise concern among European decisionmakers just as they have for their US counterparts, who emphasized the national security aspect in the executive order. “What is it going to take for European heads of state to recognize they have a national security threat from this technology?” Scott-Railton says. “Until they recognize the twin human rights and national security threats, the way the US has, they are going to be at a tremendous security disadvantage.” In your inbox: A new series of tips for how to use AI every day Meet the masked vigilante tracking down billions in crypto scams Deep dive: This app set out to fight pesticides.

            "content": "Prescott, AZ — Kari Lake stood on the steps of the Yavapai County Courthouse in Prescott the night before the US election on a bitterly cold Monday. She was addressing a couple hundred of her supporters, many of them wearing her MAKE ARIZONA GRAND AGAIN baseball hats. After walking onstage to Bonnie Tyler’s “Holding Out for a Hero,” Lake asked for a show of hands from people who were going to vote on Election Day. No one put up their hands, as attendees looked away from the stage and shifted anxiously in place. Lake, laughingly nervously, quickly switched gears and said: “You got the word to vote early. Great.” Lake, a Republican running against Democrat Ruben Gallego for a Senate seat soon to be vacated by Kyrsten Sinema, became known as one of the most vocal boosters of the election denial in the wake of the 2020 election. She has built an entire political personality on the back of promoting debunked election conspiracy theories: After quitting a 22-year-long career as an anchor at Fox 10 in Phoenix, Lake announced her candidacy for governor of Arizona in 2021 and based much of her campaign on election denial. This year, Lake has also pushed conspiracy theories about mail-in ballots and early voting, demanding a single day of in-person voting. Her support for early and mail-in voting on the eve of the election echoes the flip-flopping from former president Donald Trump, who has also realized that without early and mail-in voting he does not have a chance to win. Lake may have changed her mind on the veracity of mail-in ballots, but she remains convinced that the election will be stolen. The only solution? “We’re going to make it too big to rig,” Lake told her supporters. Throughout her Senate campaign, Lake has repeatedly refused to answer a simple question: Would she be willing to accept the results of the election?  Polling suggests that Lake could be about to face another loss, and based on her remarks throughout the campaign, it is unlikely that Lake, who will still not concede she lost in 2022, will be willing to graciously concede. Ultimately, Lake took her challenge to court and lost again. Undeterred, Lake continued to ingratiate herself with Trump and MAGA and was even considered as a possible vice presidential candidate. Now, Lake has claimed it would be foolish to commit to accepting election results without knowing what those results are. Many of her supporters who spoke to WIRED on Monday night agreed with Lake, convinced there was fraud afoot in the election already. “I don’t think we should accept anything until we know that the election is an honest election. We know the last one was rigged, and the 2020 one was rigged,” Sandy, a Lake supporter from Prescott Valley, tells WIRED. But there were also some supporters who urged their candidate to do the right thing and concede if she was defeated. “We’ve got no choice, we’ve got to accept the results,” says Rick Starmer from Chino Valley in Yavapai County.

Officials are putting in place the typical final measures to ensure the smooth operation of an election, but beyond checking that they have enough ballots and that machines are working properly, officials are now faced with having to monitor for threats and make sure they have done everything they can to protect themselves and their staff. “Given the current political environment, the possibility that an event may occur has increased, and our election professionals have responded in kind,” says Tammy Patrick, a former election official in Arizona’s Maricopa County who is now a senior adviser at the nonprofit Bolstering Elections Initiative. “Efforts focusing on the physical security of the voters, election workers, and staff by putting in bulletproof glass, panic buttons, razor wire, and fencing are fairly common, as is the installation of surveillance cameras and systems, cyber protections, and training on de-escalation techniques and response drills.” Nowhere in the US is the militarization of the election process more evident than in Maricopa County. The fourth largest county in the nation, Maricopa became ground zero for election denial conspiracists in recent years, after GOP lawmakers sanctioned a bogus recount in 2021, run by the Florida company Cyber Ninjas. As a result, the county has for years been putting increased security measures in place. “We're a fortress now,” Stephen Richer, the Maricopa County Recorder, told WIRED back in February, outlining how he had to navigate security fencing, metal detectors, and security checks in order to get into his office. As the 2024 election approaches, the measures Maricopa officials are putting in place have been ratcheted up significantly. Officials have added a second layer of security fencing to protect election offices, as well as concrete k-rails, which means election workers will be bused in from offsite locations due to reduced parking spaces. At the country’s tabulation center, every door will be fitted with metal detectors, floodlights will be installed, and on election day the center will be protected by a ring of snipers deployed on roofs around the building, election officials told NBC. There will also be mounted police on standby outside the building, round-the-clock armed security, and drones in flight over the building, monitoring for approaching threats. The entire election office building is also covered in security cameras that livestream everything online for anyone to watch, a security measure that doubles as a way of offering transparency into its election process. “The security and safety of our elections and those that help conduct them are paramount in ensuring a smooth election process,” Taylor Kinnerup, communications director for the Maricopa County Recorder’s Office, tells WIRED. “Since January of 2021, our office has increased badge security access, installed permanent barriers, and added additional cybersecurity measures based on the recommendations of law enforcement and other experts.” The threats against election workers spiked in the wake of the 2020 election, spurred on by Donald Trump’s baseless allegations that the election was stolen. While the threats receded somewhat in between election cycles, they have picked up again in recent months. WIRED revealed earlier this month that the Department of Homeland Security has issued a series of reports to government agencies warning about the “heightened risk” of right-wing extremists carrying out attacks around the election. Just last week, the Justice Department’s Election Threats Task Force announced charges against four men for threats they made against election officials. “The fact that election workers need to be worried about their security is incomprehensible and unacceptable,” FBI director Chris Wray said in a statement about the threats. Some of the charges relate to threats made back in 2022; as a result, election officials have been preparing for years for next week’s vote. Since the beginning of last year, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has conducted over 1,000 voluntary physical security assessments at election offices. One of these assessments was conducted in Pennsylvania’s Luzerne County in late August, with officials from CISA and Homeland Security recommending that barriers be installed to prevent cars from ramming into the ground floor of the building housing the county’s election offices in Wilkes Barre. “This is a measure taken to safeguard staff, the public, and the ballots,” Luzerne County manager Romilda Crocamo told local TV station WVIA earlier this month as workers installed boulders along the front of the building. Crocamo also said the county had decided against using drop boxes because they could not adequately protect them. This week, multiple drop boxes in Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington, were set on fire in incidents police say were linked. In addition to protecting the buildings where election staff work, some high-profile election officials have had to protect themselves. Arizona secretary of state Adrian Fontes, the top election official in his state, revealed on Monday that he regularly wears a bulletproof vest after a series of threats were posted online and included his home address. In Adams County, Colorado, the county clerk and recorder Josh Zygielbaum has also been advised by local police to wear body armor after someone followed him home after a recent local election. Zygielbaum recently told USA Today that he has taken the advice and now wears one every day. He has previously used militaristic phrases like “harden the office as a target” to describe his efforts to beef up security, which has included the installation of panic buttons under every desk Tate Fall, Cobb County, Georgia’s election director, has also installed panic buttons that link directly to emergency services after a poll worker reported an agitated voter during this year’s presidential primary who was carrying a gun. In some cases, new election offices have been built since the last election, including ones in California’s Los Angeles County and Durham County, North Carolina. These have been built with security in mind and feature bulletproof glass, security cameras, and doors that will open only with the right credentials. In Los Angeles County, they are also deploying trained sniffer dogs to screen all the mail coming into election offices after a surge in letters sent to officials containing white powder, several of which have tested positive for fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid that can be deadly even in small doses. As a result, most election offices across the country have Narcan kits on hand, and officials have been trained on how to administer the drug in the case of an accidental opioid overdose. Taking things a step further, in Durham County’s new election office, they have constructed a dedicated mail-sorting room that features a separate exhaust system to prevent potentially hazardous substances contaminating the rest of the office. “Election workers now need to be experts in security, cybersecurity, public health, and public relations, while handling drastically more information requests and recounts,” Adam Hinds, former Massachusetts state senator and current CEO of the nonprofit Edward M. Kennedy Institute, tells WIRED. “One problem is they are already stretched in terms of funding and resources. As election administration receives more attention, our election workers deserve the resources necessary.” In your inbox: A new series of tips for how to use AI every day Meet the masked vigilante tracking down billions in crypto scams Deep dive: This app set out to fight pesticides.

            "content": "“For those of you who want Election Night to feel even more unhinged, I highly recommend elections.omg.lol.” That's WIRED senior editor Andrew Couts talking about a single-serving site with a three-by-three grid of nine YouTube embeds, each broadcasting a 24-hour news channel’s live coverage. Election.omg.lol’s nine portals into the future of America provided a constant stream of red-and-blue maps, talking heads, and man-on-the-street reports. It was nauseating, “horrifying and kinda helpful,” and “a hell site.” It was also one of four screens I was looking at the moment I clicked on it. Yes, on election night 2024, like so many others, I had CNN on, a laptop open, and a phone in my hand. This is not new; lots of people watch TV with a second device nearby. What became clear as the results started pouring in was how much space on each of those screens was devoted to some smaller, use-specific screen. CNN, of course, had chyrons full of headlines and tickers showing how many Electoral College votes Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris had. There were also boxes blaring countdowns for when the next polls would close. My iPhone contained a revolving door of TikTok, X, and Instagram. (I saved myself a small piece of virtual estate by not turning on the Dynamic Island election results service Apple unveiled this week.) My laptop, a combination of Chrome tabs open to news sites and a Slack full of chats with coworkers—which is how I got served that Verge post in the first place. No one does picture-in-picture on their TV screens anymore, really, but TVs have been supplemented with tablets, smartphones, laptops. Nearly every screen available to us, is now full of other screens, bifurcating into oblivion. Even in VRChat, where my colleague Boone Ashworth spent much of his election eve, there were people looking at screens … embedded into the screens strapped to their faces. Not to be all Andy Rooney about it, but maybe that’s too much. Not that I want to go back to the days of just watching one thing on TV or reading one book, absent other things to distract me, but perhaps it’s time we started treating the space on screens like it holds actual value. This column is named The Monitor because it’s about the things we watch, device agnostic, but it’s also about what we pay attention to, what we observe. Maybe reducing the number of things one pays attention to provides a way to observe more. The Monitor is a weekly column devoted to everything happening in the WIRED world of culture, from movies to memes, TV to TikTok. Or, perhaps, eliminating one screen entirely is the answer. Fewer and fewer people watch TV on TVs, and according to Nielsen viewership for the presidential election was down more than 25 percent this year. More than 42 million people watched across TV networks on Tuesday. Back in 2020, that number was nearly 57 million. Covid-19 likely had more people glued to their TVs in 2020, but this election still saw a marked decrease over previous elections. Another fun stat from this week? Online doctors’ appointment app Zocdoc reports mental health bookings shot up 22 percent between 6 am and 8 am on Wednesday after the election was called for Trump. Maybe people are looking for a different kind of face time. “The Most Mysterious Song on the Internet” has been found. It’s called “Subways of Your Mind” by FEX. It took nearly 17 years and a bunch of dedicated Redditors to uncover it. It’s been a long week. Here’s Kyle MacLachlan dancing in a hot dog suit.

            "content": "A trove of leaked internal messages and documents from the militia American Patriots Three Percent—also known as AP3—reveals how the group coordinated with election denial groups as part of a plan to conduct paramilitary surveillance of ballot boxes during the midterm elections in 2022. This information was leaked to Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoSecrets), a nonprofit that says it publishes hacked and leaked documents in the public interest. The person behind these AP3 leaks is an individual who, according to their statement uploaded by DDoSecrets, infiltrated the militia and grew so alarmed by what they were seeing that they felt compelled to go public with the information ahead of the upcoming presidential election. Election and federal officials have already voiced concern about possible voter intimidation this November, in part due to the proliferation of politically violent rhetoric and election denialism. Some right-wing groups have already committed to conducting surveillance of ballot boxes remotely using AI-driven cameras. And last month, a Homeland Security bulletin warned that domestic extremist groups could plan on sabotaging election infrastructure including ballot drop boxes. Devin Burghart, president and executive director of the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights, says that AP3’s leaked plans for the 2022 midterms should be a warning for what may transpire next month. “Baseless election denial conspiracies stoking armed militia surveillance of ballot drop boxes is a dangerous form of voter intimidation,” Burghart tells WIRED. “The expansion of the election denial, increased militia activity, and growing coordination between them, is cause for serious concern heading into November. Now with voter suppression groups like True the Vote and some GOP elected officials targeting drop boxes for vigilante activity, the situation should be raising alarms.” The leaked messages from 2022 show how AP3 and other militias provided paramilitary heft to ballot box monitoring operations organized by “The People’s Movement,” the group that spearheaded the 2021 anti-vaccine convoy protest, and Clean Elections USA, a group with links to the team behind the 2000 Mules film that falsely claimed widespread voter fraud. In the leaked chats, People’s Movement leader Carolyn Smith identifies herself as an honorary AP3 member. AP3 is run by Scot Seddon, a former Army Reservist, Long Islander, and male model, according to a ProPublica profile on him published in August. That profile, which relied on the same anonymous infiltrator who leaked AP3’s internal messages to DDoSecrets, explains that AP3 escaped scrutiny in the aftermath of January 6 in part because Seddon, after spending weeks preparing his ranks to go to DC, ultimately decided to save his soldiers for another day. ProPublica reported that some members went anyway but were under strict instruction to forgo any AP3 insignia. According to the leaked messages, Seddon also directed his state leaders to participate in the “operation.” “All of us have a vested interest in this nation,” Seddon said in a leaked video. “So all the state leaders should be getting their people out and manning and observing ballot boxes, to watch for ballot stuffing. This is priority. This goes against getting your double cheeseburger at mcdonalds … Our nation depends on this. Our future depends on this. This ain't no bullshit issue. We need to be tight on this, straight up.” A flier using militaristic language shared across various state-specific Telegram channels lays out how this operation would work. With “Rules of Engagement” instructions, “Volunteers” are told not to interfere with anyone dropping off their ballots. If someone is suspected of dropping off “multiple ballots,” then observers are told to record the event, and make a note of the individual's appearance and their vehicle's license plate number. In the event of any sort of confrontation, they’re supposed to “report as soon as possible to your area Captain.” “At the end of each shift, Patriots will prepare a brief report of activity and transmit it to [the ballot] box team Captain promptly,” the flier states. The person who leaked these documents and messages says that these paramilitary observers masquerading as civilians will often have a QRF—quick reaction force—on standby who can “stage an armed response” should a threat or confrontation arise. The goal of the “operation,” according to that flier, was to “Stop the Mules.” “These are the individuals stuffing ballot boxes,” the flier says. “They are well trained and financed. There is a global network backing them up. They pick up fake ballots from phony non-profits and deliver them to ballot boxes, usually between 2400 hours and 0600 hours.” (This was the core conspiracy of 2,000 Mules; the conservative media company behind the film has since issued an apology for promoting election conspiracies and committed to halting its distribution). Fears about widespread armed voter intimidation during the 2022 midterms—stemming from online chatter and warnings from federal agencies—never materialized in full. However, there were scattered instances of people showing up to observe ballot drops in Arizona. These individuals, according to the statement by the anonymous leaker in the DDoSecrets files, were not “lone wolves”—they were part of “highly organized groups who intended to influence the elections through intimidation.” In one widely-publicized incident, two clearly armed people wearing balaclavas and tactical gear showed up in Mesa, Arizona, to conduct drop box surveillance. They were never identified, though a Telegram video on DDoSecrets shows AP3’s North Carolina chapter head Burley Ross admitting that one of them was part of his unit. Ross says that the individual was Elias Humiston, who had previously been conducting vigilante border surveillance. “I was well aware they were doing drop box observations,” said Ross. “I was not aware they were doing so in full kit.” Ross added that Humiston had since resigned from the group. Seddon also addressed the “little incident in Arizona,” stressing the importance of maintaining clean optics to avoid scrutiny. “We had pushed for helping to maintain election integrity through monitoring the ballot boxes,” said Seddon, in a video message on Telegram. “We never told anyone to do it like that.” The militia movement largely retreated from public view in the aftermath of the January 6 riot at the US Capitol in 2021. The high-profile implication of the Oath Keepers in the riot, which at the time was America’s biggest militia, thrust the broader militia movement into the spotlight. Amid intense scrutiny, stigma, and creeping paranoia about federal informants, some militias rebanded or even disbanded. But as WIRED reporting has shown, after a brief lull in activity, the militia movement has been quietly rebuilding, reorganizing, and recruiting. With AP3 at its helm, it’s also been engaging in armed training. Election conspiracies have only continued to fester since 2022, and AP3 has been aggressively recruiting and organizing. Moreover, the rhetoric in the group has also intensified. “The next election won’t be decided at a Ballot Box,” wrote an AP3 leader earlier this year in a private chat, according to ProPublica. “It’ll be decided at the ammo box.” “Every American has a right to go to the ballot box without fear and the authorities need to urgently learn the lessons of 2022—and the lessons contained in these documents—so they can prevent something even worse from happening in the coming weeks,” the infiltrator wrote in the DDoS statement.

            "content": "If Donald Trump wins the US presidential election in November, the guardrails could come off of artificial intelligence development, even as the dangers of defective AI models grow increasingly serious. Trump’s election to a second term would dramatically reshape—and possibly cripple—efforts to protect Americans from the many dangers of poorly designed artificial intelligence, including misinformation, discrimination, and the poisoning of algorithms used in technology like autonomous vehicles. The federal government has begun overseeing and advising AI companies under an executive order that President Joe Biden issued in October 2023. But Trump has vowed to repeal that order, with the Republican Party platform saying it “hinders AI innovation” and “imposes Radical Leftwing ideas” on AI development. Trump’s promise has thrilled critics of the executive order who see it as illegal, dangerous, and an impediment to America’s digital arms race with China. Those critics include many of Trump’s closest allies, from X CEO Elon Musk and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen to Republican members of Congress and nearly two dozen GOP state attorneys general. Trump’s running mate, Ohio senator JD Vance, is staunchly opposed to AI regulation. “Republicans don't want to rush to overregulate this industry,” says Jacob Helberg, a tech executive and AI enthusiast who has been dubbed “Silicon Valley’s Trump whisperer.” But tech and cyber experts warn that eliminating the EO’s safety and security provisions would undermine the trustworthiness of AI models that are increasingly creeping into all aspects of American life, from transportation and medicine to employment and surveillance. The upcoming presidential election, in other words, could help determine whether AI becomes an unparalleled tool of productivity or an uncontrollable agent of chaos. Biden’s order addresses everything from using AI to improve veterans’ health care to setting safeguards for AI’s use in drug discovery. But most of the political controversy over the EO stems from two provisions in the section dealing with digital security risks and real-world safety impacts. One provision requires owners of powerful AI models to report to the government about how they’re training the models and protecting them from tampering and theft, including by providing the results of “red-team tests” designed to find vulnerabilities in AI systems by simulating attacks. The other provision directs the Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to produce guidance that helps companies develop AI models that are safe from cyberattacks and free of biases. Work on these projects is well underway. The government has proposed quarterly reporting requirements for AI developers, and NIST has released AI guidance documents on risk management, secure software development, synthetic content watermarking, and preventing model abuse, in addition to launching multiple initiatives to promote model testing. Supporters of these efforts say they’re essential to maintaining basic government oversight of the rapidly expanding AI industry and nudging developers toward better security. But to conservative critics, the reporting requirement is illegal government overreach that will crush AI innovation and expose developers’ trade secrets, while the NIST guidance is a liberal ploy to infect AI with far-left notions about disinformation and bias that amount to censorship of conservative speech. At a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, last December, Trump took aim at Biden’s EO after alleging without evidence that the Biden administration had already used AI for nefarious purposes. “When I’m reelected,” he said, “I will cancel Biden’s artificial intelligence executive order and ban the use of AI to censor the speech of American citizens on Day One.” Biden’s effort to collect information about how companies are developing, testing, and protecting their AI models sparked an uproar on Capitol Hill almost as soon as it debuted. Congressional Republicans seized on the fact that Biden justified the new requirement by invoking the 1950 Defense Production Act, a wartime measure that lets the government direct private-sector activities to ensure a reliable supply of goods and services. GOP lawmakers called Biden’s move inappropriate, illegal, and unnecessary. Conservatives have also blasted the reporting requirement as a burden on the private sector. The provision “could scare away would-be innovators and impede more ChatGPT-type breakthroughs,” Representative Nancy Mace said during a March hearing she chaired on “White House overreach on AI.” Helberg says a burdensome requirement would benefit established companies and hurt startups. He also says Silicon Valley critics fear the requirements “are a stepping stone” to a licensing regime in which developers must receive government permission to test models. Steve DelBianco, the CEO of the conservative tech group NetChoice, says the requirement to report red-team test results amounts to de facto censorship, given that the government will be looking for problems like bias and disinformation. “I am completely worried about a left-of-center administration … whose red-teaming tests will cause AI to constrain what it generates for fear of triggering these concerns,” he says. Conservatives argue that any regulation that stifles AI innovation will cost the US dearly in the technology competition with China. “They are so aggressive, and they have made dominating AI a core North Star of their strategy for how to fight and win wars,” Helberg says. “The gap between our capabilities and the Chinese keeps shrinking with every passing year.” By including social harms in its AI security guidelines, NIST has outraged conservatives and set off another front in the culture war over content moderation and free speech. Republicans decry the NIST guidance as a form of backdoor government censorship. Senator Ted Cruz recently slammed what he called NIST’s “woke AI ‘safety’ standards” for being part of a Biden administration “plan to control speech” based on “amorphous” social harms. NetChoice has warned NIST that it is exceeding its authority with quasi-regulatory guidelines that upset “the appropriate balance between transparency and free speech.” Many conservatives flatly dismiss the idea that AI can perpetuate social harms and should be designed not to do so. “This is a solution in search of a problem that really doesn't exist,” Helberg says. “There really hasn’t been massive evidence of issues in AI discrimination.” Studies and investigations have repeatedly shown that AI models contain biases that perpetuate discrimination, including in hiring, policing, and health care. Research suggests that people who encounter these biases may unconsciously adopt them. Conservatives worry more about AI companies’ overcorrections to this problem than about the problem itself. “There is a direct inverse correlation between the degree of wokeness in an AI and the AI's usefulness,” Helberg says, citing an early issue with Google’s generative AI platform. Republicans want NIST to focus on AI’s physical safety risks, including its ability to help terrorists build bioweapons (something Biden’s EO does address). If Trump wins, his appointees will likely deemphasize government research on AI’s social harms. Helberg complains that the “enormous amount” of research on AI bias has dwarfed studies of “greater threats related to terrorism and biowarfare.” AI experts and lawmakers offer robust defenses of Biden’s AI safety agenda. These projects “enable the United States to remain on the cutting edge” of AI development “while protecting Americans from potential harms,” says Representative Ted Lieu, the Democratic cochair of the House’s AI task force. The reporting requirements are essential for alerting the government to potentially dangerous new capabilities in increasingly powerful AI models, says a US government official who works on AI issues. The official, who requested anonymity to speak freely, points to OpenAI’s admission about its latest model’s “inconsistent refusal of requests to synthesize nerve agents.” The official says the reporting requirement isn’t overly burdensome. They argue that, unlike AI regulations in the European Union and China, Biden’s EO reflects “a very broad, light-touch approach that continues to foster innovation.” Nick Reese, who served as the Department of Homeland Security’s first director of emerging technology from 2019 to 2023, rejects conservative claims that the reporting requirement will jeopardize companies’ intellectual property. And he says it could actually benefit startups by encouraging them to develop “more computationally efficient,” less data-heavy AI models that fall under the reporting threshold. AI’s power makes government oversight imperative, says Ami Fields-Meyer, who helped draft Biden’s EO as a White House tech official. “We’re talking about companies that say they’re building the most powerful systems in the history of the world,” Fields-Meyer says. “The government’s first obligation is to protect people. ‘Trust me, we’ve got this’ is not an especially compelling argument.” Experts praise NIST’s security guidance as a vital resource for building protections into new technology. They note that flawed AI models can produce serious social harms, including rental and lending discrimination and improper loss of government benefits. Trump’s own first-term AI order required federal AI systems to respect civil rights, something that will require research into social harms. The AI industry has largely welcomed Biden’s safety agenda. “What we're hearing is that it’s broadly useful to have this stuff spelled out,” the US official says. For new companies with small teams, “it expands the capacity of their folks to address these concerns.” Rolling back Biden’s EO would send an alarming signal that “the US government is going to take a hands off approach to AI safety,” says Michael Daniel, a former presidential cyber adviser who now leads the Cyber Threat Alliance, an information sharing nonprofit. As for competition with China, the EO’s defenders say safety rules will actually help America prevail by ensuring that US AI models work better than their Chinese rivals and are protected from Beijing’s economic espionage. If Trump wins the White House next month, expect a sea change in how the government approaches AI safety. Republicans want to prevent AI harms by applying “existing tort and statutory laws” as opposed to enacting broad new restrictions on the technology, Helberg says, and they favor “much greater focus on maximizing the opportunity afforded by AI, rather than overly focusing on risk mitigation.” That would likely spell doom for the reporting requirement and possibly some of the NIST guidance. The reporting requirement could also face legal challenges now that the Supreme Court has weakened the deference that courts used to give agencies in evaluating their regulations. And GOP pushback could even jeopardize NIST’s voluntary AI testing partnerships with leading companies. “What happens to those commitments in a new administration?” the US official asks. This polarization around AI has frustrated technologists who worry that Trump will undermine the quest for safer models. “Alongside the promises of AI are perils,” says Nicol Turner Lee, the director of the Brookings Institution’s Center for Technology Innovation, “and it is vital that the next president continue to ensure the safety and security of these systems.” In your inbox: Upgrade your life with WIRED-tested gear A bitcoin mining dream turned into a nightmare The Big Interview: Marissa Mayer—I am a software girl I made a wholesome OnlyFans to try to make ends meet Event: Join us for The Big Interview on December 3 in San Francisco More From WIRED Reviews and Guides © 2024 Condé Nast.

            "content": "The first time Kamala Harris won more than a citywide political contest was in the summer of 2010. Jerry Brown had just decided not to run for another term as California’s attorney general and instead try for a third term in the governor’s office he’d occupied from 1975 to 1983. Harris, then San Francisco’s district attorney, decided to join the race to succeed him as AG, and she came out easily on top of a crowded Democratic field. Then, that fall, she barely nosed out her much better-known Republican opponent. It was the beginning of her career as a national figure. Back during that 2010 campaign, the newly-hired MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell picked out Harris as the candidate Republicans should fear as “the next big Democratic star” and “the female Obama.” He ran a clip of her speech at the victory celebration after she won the primary for attorney general, which I happened to see. Harris, then in her mid-forties, looked and sounded surprisingly similar to the presidential candidate before us now, who turned 60 two weeks before Election Day. But she said something that has stayed with me. Kamala Harris holds a news conference in November 2010. “We are the state that creates leadership for the rest of this country,” she told a cheering crowd of Californians, “based on our belief that we can be tough, and we can be smart—and all the time be dedicated to our history, while being empowered to know our destiny.” It was rhetoric that tapped deep into a shared awareness of California’s outsize role as a trendsetter and model-builder in American life. That is not the way Kamala Harris talks these days. Unless I’ve missed it, she hasn’t discussed a California “model” or its success stories, the way Republicans like Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott do about their states, and as her running mate Tim Walz does about his own Minnesota. Her mentions of her time as district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general of the state are largely grim: sex predators, drug traffickers, domestic abusers safely prosecuted and sent away. Her California background seems to be something she is running despite, rather than running on. Of course that’s understandable. Harris’ audience now is bigger than the one in 2010. And unlike DeSantis, Abbott, and Walz, she’s never been a governor, with a list of programmatic accomplishments to tick off. But it’s also an obvious tell about California’s changed place in the national and global mind. California has at many points been held up as an American paradise. Now it’s widely seen as closer to hell. Runaway housing prices, tax burdens, homelessness, congestion, fire, drought, flood. The best sides of tech innovation, and the worst of tech-bro greed and narcissism. These are the state’s hallmarks. This perception is particularly rampant among Republicans: Polls show that two-thirds of Republicans say this one US state has done more damage than good for the country, and that almost half of them don’t consider it “American” at all. Beyond political party, fully half of adult Americans say in polls that California is in decline. As a recent headline put it shortly before Harris became the Democratic nominee, “California’s image will be a weapon” against her as a candidate. Damage and destruction from the 2024 Airport Fire in Lake Elsinore, California. Never mind that one in every eight Americans still lives in California—a population larger than 21 other US states combined—and that its economic output is bigger than any entire non-US country except China, Japan, or Germany, and that it’s the birthplace of an disproportionate share of the world’s most familiar and valuable brand names. The overwhelming sense is that the California miracle is over, its reservoirs of dynamism as tapped out as the Central Valley’s aquifers during recent years of drought. As a Californian who has spent most of his life in other parts of the United States, and as an American who has lived for more than a dozen years in other parts of the world, I’ve often been struck by the ways declinist alarmism about my home state can feel like a displaced version of declinist alarmism about my home country as a whole. I’ve been around long enough, and reported on enough of America’s recurring crises, to be familiar with this pattern. The United States, it seems, is always about to collapse or tear itself apart—because of war and turmoil in the 1960s, oil shock and stagflation in the 1970s, the Reagan recession and the Japanese menace in the 1980s, and on through all the other decades’ predicaments, right up to its political divisions today. But just as each wave of declinist certainty sets in, the US somehow wriggles, or struggles, or innovates, or immigrates its way to a quicker rebound than any other country—as it has most recently in its economic growth since the pandemic. America’s long history has been a seesaw between facing dire problems (often of its own creation) and lurching toward solutions. And in this respect above all, what’s true of the United States is true of its most important state: It’s like the fulcrum of the seesaw. “California is America, but sooner,” the USC sociologist Manual Pastor has said. That goes for huge cultural and demographic shifts (California was the first mainland US state whose diverse population became “majority-minority,” back in the 1990s, a full generation ago) and for era-defining crises, self-inflicted and not. And most importantly, it also goes for solutions—the kind that can redirect the momentum of American life, and life around the world, with a leverage no other state possesses. Just take the area of gasoline-powered transportation. After World War II, when American car culture was famously getting minted in Southern California, the state used a gas tax hike to build out one of the first modern freeway networks. In the ’50s, the US federal government borrowed that same model to construct the interstate highway system. Then, starting in the 1980s, California led the fight against leaded gasoline, eventually banning its sale in 1992, four years before the US as a whole did the same. In 2019, after Donald Trump’s administration rolled back emissions standards for cars, California struck a deal with the world’s leading carmakers, from Ford to Honda to VW and BMW—to make existing standards even tougher in the face of climate change. The size of the California market made this a de facto national standard (which the Biden administration later ratified). It would be one thing if this were just a history lesson. But the same kind of dynamic is playing out right now in a few crucial arenas that virtually no one beyond California is talking about. And I’m happy to report that the America taking shape on its Pacific coast is again inventing solutions far more rapidly than conventional wisdom has accounted for. I was bullish on these emerging transformations even before Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee for president. If she wins, what she knows from California will presumably affect her approach to the country and the world. Her California-ness is one of the least-discussed but most important aspects of her, including the upbeat approach to today’s diversity and tomorrow’s opportunities that is such a contrast to Donald Trump. But if she doesn’t get that far, California is likely to chug along with all the more purpose, maintaining its nation-scale example of how else things can be done. Whoever guides national politics, California deserves new attention as the “reinvention state” rather than a “resistance state.” Even under Trump, there’s still a good chance that as California goes, so eventually goes the country, and eventually much of the world. Here are a few illustrations of where it’s headed. None of these is “the” solution to California’s many problems. But each of them illustrates the creative spirit from which solutions have always come. For starters, let’s return to the thread of transportation: By now, of course, the pioneering freeway system California built in the 20th century is a maxed-out, congested mess. And the state cannot build more freeways; where they’re needed, there’s no more room, and any that are built fill up as soon as they’re opened. Without new forms of transportation, the state will become increasingly paralyzed, and all its other problems will become worse. Which is why, back in 2008, California voters approved a nearly $10 billion initial bond issue to build a high-speed rail line eventually running some 500 miles from Los Angeles to San Francisco, through the Central Valley corridor. That was 16 years ago. If you’ve heard anything at all about this project since then, it’s that it is a white elephant, a doomed relic, a cautionary lesson, and any other metaphor for failure you might choose. And yes, the complaint list is long. The project is way over budget (to the tune of $100 billion) and far behind its original schedule. Parts of the line were supposed to be up and running already. As it is, the first service isn’t projected to begin until 2030—and then only on the 171-mile segment from Merced, in the northern half of California’s Central Valley, to Bakersfield, on the southern end. This abbreviated initial route has been dubbed a “train to nowhere,” a stock insult that grates on people in the Central Valley but captures the frustration of people stuck in LA or Bay Area traffic. And given how the entire funding-hungry project has become an object of the culture wars, it is little wonder that for many, the project seems as remote and implausible as human settlements on Mars. When done, this will be among the very fastest mainline high-speed rail systems running anywhere on Earth—at 220 mph. But I’ve been following the back-and-forth for more than a decade, and I’ve started to see California’s high-speed rail project with a new clarity. In the aviation world, pilots are trained to recognize the “point of no return,” when you’ve gone so far that you’d only lose by going back. That’s where California is with high-speed rail. Consider the weight of a few recent facts: This summer the project received full “environmental clearance” for the entire 463 miles from downtown LA to downtown San Francisco, with clearance for a further 31 miles from LA to Anaheim expected next year. Nearly all of the thousands of necessary land parcels have been secured. Construction in the Central Valley is much further along than most people realize: Some 12,000 people have long been at work there, and test trains should be running in three or four years. And what hasn’t sunk in is that, when done, this will be among the very fastest mainline high-speed rail systems running anywhere on Earth. (At 220 mph, it would beat the 200-mph range for European trains and the famed Shinkansen in Japan, or match the fastest stretches of the Beijing-to-Shanghai line in China.) Not only that, in a worldwide first, California’s system will use solar-generated electricity the entire way. Over the past decade, I’ve visited Fresno, the biggest city along the initial route (population 545,000), about a dozen times. There and in surrounding areas you can see the rail taking shape month by month, mile by mile. You see the kind of gigantic, heavy-industrial construction projects I remember from living in China, when a new subway line seemed to be opening every month. You see earth movers bigger than school buses; concrete bridge-supports as long as airliners. The Tule River Viaduct, shown under construction here, will carry some of the world's fastest trains. “If you listen to California’s political class, the high-speed rail project sounds like a textbook boondoggle,” Yousef Baig wrote on the nonprofit news site CalMatters in January. “Yet in communities across California’s farm belt, the discourse is refreshingly different. It’s a symbol of transformation for a region that’s already bursting with activity.” In part because of housing costs and traffic in the state’s biggest cities, communities in the Central Valley are the fastest-growing in the state; they are also some of the poorest, and the ones hardest hit by drought, particulate pollution, and climate change. These are the cities that will be the first to benefit from these futuristic new trains. The logic of opening a semirural section of the larger project as soon as possible—and not waiting for the state’s big population hubs before any trains start running—is pretty clear at this point. “I’m firmly convinced that the first time the first customer buys a first ticket for the first true high-speed rail trip on US soil, there will be no going back,” I heard Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg say this spring in Washington. “People will expect and demand it everywhere.” And lest Americans assume they will remain relegated to the kids’ table of railway systems, the world truly is watching California. At an international gathering of high-speed rail officials this year, I heard officials from France, Italy, Germany, Austria, and even the home of the Shinkansen, Japan, speak eagerly and admiringly about what they hoped to see and learn from California’s system. “It will be an incredible feat of civilization,” Ezra Silk, of the US High Speed Rail Coalition, told me. “It is something we should celebrate as visionary.” Over the centuries, there’s a consistent pattern: Most big projects seem doomed before they’re done. Being over budget and behind schedule doesn’t prove that a huge infrastructure project will succeed. But it fits a familiar pattern. The Erie Canal. The Transcontinental Railroad. The Panama Canal. Those are just a few of the projects condemned as follies, boondoggles, or cesspools of corruption during the long years before their completion. The jewel of Sydney’s waterfront, its stunning Opera House, was widely ridiculed before its opening. Late, over budget, and the subject of bitter political and legal battles. Now it is hard to imagine the city without it. The state also doesn’t have an alternative. Not only are new freeways off the table, California will also never open another big airport. Through most of each day LAX and SFO are already landing as many planes-per-hour as they ever will, and San Diego and San Jose are nearly as busy. (I speak as a longtime pilot, and one who has studied peak-capacity issues at the airports.) And if the state tried to meet its transportation demands with new highways and air nodes, they’d be even more expensive than the trains, to say nothing of the climate effects. With high-speed rail, it's time to get all aboard. California’s new rail system is meant to set a model for addressing a fundamental “hardware” problem for the state and much of America. What is the main “software” problem for modern America? Disconnection, loneliness, the withering-away of “social capital,” the conversion of neighborhoods and real communities into mere lodging sites, whose residents have as weak a common bond as guests at a crowded hotel. The idea of an atomized America may be overstated—when my wife, Deb, and I spent several years reporting from smaller-town America through the 2010s, we found enough examples of reconnection and civic-mindedness to have made Alexis de Tocqueville proud. But polls, news accounts, and the hell of national politics all suggest that the problem is real. This is the challenge against which California may be creating its most original and ambitious model, and the one which, in contrast to high-speed rail, is already widely recognized as a success. It’s also the one you’re least likely to have seen covered in the news.The official name for this five-year-old project—a big, sprawling set of programs—is California Volunteers, or CalVolunteers for short. It is already bigger than the entire Peace Corps. Its programs have more applicants than spaces to fill and are limited only by how quickly the state can expand funding. And states across the country are embracing the model, with credit to its California origins. CalVolunteers falls under the purview of the state’s chief service officer, a new position in the governor’s cabinet that Gavin Newsom established early in his first term. Since the start of the program, its director has been Josh Fryday, who, like his friend Pete Buttigieg, is in his early forties and has similarities in background and role as “chief explainer” and advocate for his programs. Fryday, from the small Bay Area town of Novato, graduated from UC Berkeley and its law school, then served as Navy JAG officer (and handled Guantanamo cases), then returned to Novato and was elected mayor. He was named to Newsom’s cabinet five years ago, at age 38. Long before Newsom’s arrival as governor, California—like most states—had a variety of public service and volunteer programs under the CalVolunteers label, many of them in partnership with the nationwide AmeriCorps system. Newsom’s innovation was to elevate them to cabinet level in a new department, with more funding, and to make them a personal trademark issue. (His wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, plays an active role as honorary chair of CalVolunteers.) I began to pay serious attention to this new program in the early stages of the pandemic, when it quickly organized ways around the state for volunteers to fill suddenly-emerging needs—for instance, delivering food or medical supplies to people who were quarantined or unable to go out for it, or working in shelters or other crucial facilities that had lost their normal staff. I had happened to meet Fryday just before the pandemic lockdowns, when I was visiting my Southern California home town and he was launching a tree-planting program for student volunteers there. As the scope of CalVolunteers programs has expanded since then, my wife and I have been to visit more than a dozen CalVolunteers worksites. Teenagers training for new job skills in downtown Oakland and starting urban gardens in places that had been “heat islands.” Young artists in a beaten-down part of Riverside helping to restore and beautify buildings. Grade-school children around the state learning how to plant and tend to trees. One of the best-known and largest programs is the California College Corps. It combines the main element of the original GI Bill—namely, rewarding service with educational benefits—with a Peace Corps–like ambition of fostering lifelong connections and a habit of looking for ways to serve. College Corps members commit to spending up to 450 hours on projects in their locality, tutoring and mentoring younger students, assisting in eldercare, working in food banks, doing environmental work, and so on. In return, they earn up to $10,000 toward their college expenses, plus other support from the partner schools themselves, all toward creating a “debt-free path” to a college education. Why $10,000? That’s a typical amount that recipients of Pell Grants, the main federal financial-aid program for college students, provide toward college costs, which often requires their taking out a loan or getting a part-time job. “Ten thousand dollars is a very intentional number,” Fryday told me. “It’s a way to have a debt-free path to an education. It makes the difference between working in a coffee shop to raise the money or serving the community.” A UC Irvine student, right, helps to package salad dressing as part of the College Corps program. The groups we met were “majority-minority” and in that way representative of the state’s population as a whole. Nearly all said they were the first in their families ever to go to college—and that the financial support and organizational structure of the College Corps had made that step more practical for them. In this third year of operations alone, the College Corps program received 10,000 applications for 3,000 available slots. Fryday’s goal is to have 10,000 graduates of the program by the end of its fourth year. And the number of “partner schools” has expanded from eight the first year to 44 now, ranging from the flagship UC Berkeley campus to small-town community colleges. “Absolutely, our ambition is to export this,” Newsom told us. If there’s any program more popular than the College Corps, it would be the California Climate Action Corps, which in its latest cycle had six applicants for each of the 400 spaces it could offer. The people in the program improve waterways, plant native drought-resistant trees, restore marshlands, develop urban gardens, equip homes for fire-resistance. This year its members committed to planting 90,000 trees across the state—the sort of long-term, public-benefit project you would associate with Franklin Roosevelt’s Civilian Conservation Corps. People who have read about the death of civic culture and the despair of screen-bound young Americans should see and meet some of these corps members. One example of hundreds: Chiena Ty, now 27, came to northern California at age 3 from the Philippines with her parents, who were from Manila and southern China. She graduated from California High School in San Ramon and went to college at UC Riverside. But she was attracted to the Climate Action Corps and the chance to serve back in the Bay Area, near her family. We met her at the White Pony Express food reclamation site in Contra Costa County, on the east side of the San Francisco Bay. Volunteers ranging from teenagers to retirees spend hours there sorting through expired food from major grocery chains or restaurants and repacking it for food banks, homeless shelters, assisted-living facilities, and other places of need—rather than sending it to a methane-producing landfill. Chiena spent part of each Climate Corps day on the sorting line and part making videos or giving public presentations about the climate consequences of wasted food. Last year, Deb and I asked the governor why he had put so much emphasis on CalVolunteers. “What are the two driving forces in life?” Newsom responded. “They’re inspiration and desperation, and in this case it was probably the latter.” The worsening polarization of public life made him wonder, he said: “How do we reconcile our differences? How do we soften the edges and tone it down, since divorce is not an option for the country and we have to live together?”Newsom said that one of his heroes was Sargent Shriver, the brother-in-law of John F. Kennedy, who is best known for leading the Peace Corps through its celebrated founding years in the 1960s. Shriver, like so many American civic and cultural leaders of that era, had been a combat veteran of World War II and was forever affected and inspired by the enforced sense of civic connection through the Depression, New Deal, and wartime years. “The fact is, we no longer have these widely shared experiences,” Newsom told us, referring to Shriver’s time in uniform. In those days, nearly every family had some direct exposure to military service. Now comparatively few do. The point is not that the US needs more wars or more people in uniform but rather that it has dramatically fewer people routinely exposed to fellow citizens of different backgrounds. “Everyone longs for a sense of belonging, of meaning, of purpose and mission,” Newsom told us. He said that his goal was to make public service so attractive and available that it became “universal”—not mandatory, as with a draft, but normal, natural, and expected, as part of growing up and even as part of growing older. And by “universal,” Newsom also means people in other states. “Absolutely, our ambition is to export this,” Newsom told us. In the summer of 2023, a few weeks after Chiena Ty guided us through the White Pony Express food reclamation site, she introduced another visitor for a look around another Bay Area conservation site: President Joe Biden. This summer, Biden swore in the inaugural class of the American Climate Corps, citing California as an example for the nation. Half a dozen governors have started projects similar to California’s climate corps and college corps in their states: Vermont, Minnesota, New Mexico, Colorado, Iowa, and more, with Republican-led Utah probably next on the list. Kathy Hochul, governor of New York, has explicitly credited CalVolunteers as an inspiration for her new statewide service program. In Maryland, Wes Moore, now in his first term as governor, has launched a new program for volunteer service. “I don’t think we would have been able to do it at this scale if not for the work of California, and other states,” he told me this summer. Moore is, like Fryday, a young veteran of the “long wars”-era military. He was in the 82nd Airborne in Afghanistan. “I believe that in a time of divisiveness and vitriol, service will save us,” he said. “Service is sticky. If we can serve together we can thrive.” This is California, so we’ll end with a tech story. But it’s not about one of the famous companies that, for all their benefits, are always taking. Taking your particulars. Your preferences. Worst of all, your attention. Instead we’ll talk about a company most people have not heard of. My parents were part of the great post–World War II migration from the East Coast to California. I grew up with my three younger siblings in the small inland California town of Redlands. Its main business then was orange-growing. It was the kind of place Joan Didion wrote about as being repeatedly blasted by the unforgiving, furnace-hot Santa Ana winds. As our family kept growing, we kept moving to slightly bigger houses. Many weekends, we drove to the local nursery to buy seed, sod, and supplies. It was run by the Dutch-immigrant Dangermond family. My dad, a small-town doctor, gave some of them medical care. I didn’t know it at the time, but this was my introduction to one of the most powerful, least publicized tech tycoons of our era: Jack Dangermond, son of the immigrant nursery owners, and Laura Dangermond (a couple since they met in the early 1960s at Redlands High). After Jack’s time in college at Cal Poly Pomona and his time in graduate school at the University of Minnesota, followed by Harvard, the couple came back to Redlands. They started a company in an unlikely location, with an entirely novel mission, that has quietly provided the operating system for much of what you do each day. Esri, short for the original name of Environmental Systems Research Institute, is the most commercially successful entity worldwide in the field known as “GIS”—geographic information system, which is both a precursor of Waze and Google Earth and a vastly more powerful version of either of them. If you have ever done anything involving location—having a package delivered, having a gas or electric or sewer line outside your house repaired, having an ambulance or fire truck or police squad routed to your neighborhood—you have almost certainly relied on software developed by Esri. Almost every city and state government around the entire world has licensed and used the company’s GIS software for decades to understand where things are and how they interact. National governments use it for climate-forecasting, disease-tracking, regional-planning, and other purposes, including national defense. The United Nations relies on Esri software to track where drought or food supplies are becoming most critical, where the natural environment is most under attack, where global conservation efforts can make the most difference. When Tim Walz was announced as Kamala Harris’ running mate, my reaction was “well, sure” rather than “who’s he?”—because I had heard him talk several times at Esri’s huge international User Conferences, about the way geographical information had guided his policies as governor of Minnesota. The annual subscription fees for Esri’s software can cost corporations and government agencies many thousands of dollars. The company, still privately owned, is very profitable. But from the start its founders have believed that technology gave their company a responsibility, as well as an opportunity. They’ve made the software available free to K-12 schools around the world and have put more than $10 million into training and curriculum programs for the schools. TechSoup, a site that guides nonprofits to free or discounted technology, has featured Esri software. Jack Dangermond told me recently that, in part through TechSoup, the number of nonprofits using the company’s tools has doubled in the past year and is now more than 10,000. Environmental groups in Brazil and Colombia protecting forest reserves; public high school students in Los Angeles mapping patterns of health, pollution, and poverty in their communities; farmers in Africa mapping climate trends to choose their crops. More than 100 city, county, and regional jurisdictions across Southern California coordinate their transportation, land-use, and zoning programs with Esri software. “It’s a unique, coordinated effort,” Damian Spangrud of Esri told me. “If you’re zoning and you run up against the city boundary, you need to know what’s happening on the other side.” “A lot of the tech companies take data from their customers and monetize it themselves,” Jack Dangermond said. “What we do is ask our customers to share their data with other customers.” When I talked to Dangermond this month, he said that his users had created more than 73 million online maps from their own data, and more than 120 million counting those on their own local systems, with the total growing by thousands per day. The “geo-analysis” part of the GIS toolkit includes ways to combine weather data, animal records, flood or fire patterns, and other information to identify the places that really matter for species survival. The NatureServe nonprofit group in the US has created an Esri map of hot spots for “biodiversity importance.” The UN Biodiversity Lab has done it for lands and oceans around the world. And in California, Governor Newsom signed an executive order kicking off an initiative, involving Esri’s tools, for what he called “Thirty by Thirty,” or 30x30. The idea was to recognize and protect the most biologically important 30 percent of the state’s lands and water, or roughly 6 million acres of land and half a million of coastal and inland waters. It’s an international goal, but California is setting an example in putting it to the test. “This is the first place that has taken it seriously,” Jack Dangermond told me. He said that the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a leading worldwide sustainability organization, has “modeled conservation programs for the globe on what California has done.” California’s high-speed rail ambition is infrastructure in its most tangible sense. CalVolunteers addresses the civic infrastructure that distinguishes a society in collapse from one renewing itself. Esri’s software provides digital connective infrastructure between the two. In the 1950s and 1960s, Jerry Brown’s father, Pat Brown, was a two-term governor of the state. He took office intending to do a lot, to do it on a grand scale, to do it fast, and to do it for the long term. It seems incredible in retrospect, but within less than a decade, his plans helped build and open three entire new campuses of the University of California system: San Diego, Santa Cruz, and Irvine. I was a schoolchild through those years and took this pace of expansion in my home state for granted. Now we’d associate it only with overnight-infrastructure projects in China or maybe one of the Emirates. The story of America involves continued rediscovery of its potential. That is the story of the most American state as well. “I’d give anything to trade for America’s problems,” a senior Chinese bureaucrat told me in 2008, when I was living in Beijing and the United States seemed to be in free fall. America had emergencies; China, he explained, had more threatening long-term weaknesses—as has become clear in the years since then. As I write, America’s immediate political prospects are uncertain. But however this year’s election turns out—with a president who was born in California, or with a California girding itself to show that it still represents the future—the state demands attention for its many innovations, and not just its travails. “The best minds in the world call California home because they’re liberated from the constraints of conformity and tradition,” Gavin Newsom said in his latest State of the State address. “California has figured out a way to make it work time and time again, decade after decade.”Is this boosterism? Of course. But it is also an important constant in the American story, and California’s. I’d bet on it again. Let us know what you think about this article.

            "content": "A presidential campaign is an expression of ideology, often vocalized as a number of promises. Sometimes, those promises are made even when they’re outside the scope of what a president can enact. With Vice President Kamala Harris taking on former President Donald Trump, The Verge’s election guide attempts to cut through the noise of electioneering to identify the actual policies at stake. For the tech industry, many issues hang in the balance, including the regulatory power to govern AI, monopolies, and cryptocurrency. More broadly, this election will determine the future of electric vehicles and how the US approaches climate change.  But The Verge’s stake in this election is larger than just the tech issues. Every day, we walk our readers through the collective action problems that bedevil hardware, software, the internet, and all the other building blocks that make up our future. Once you start looking for collective action problems, you see them everywhere. What’s at stake in this election is whether it’s the government’s job to solve these problems — or whether anyone should even bother trying.  An endorsement of democracy, solving problems, and Kamala Harris. Your vote matters. Here’s how it will change the future. The Verge’s guide to Project 2025. Conservative courts are strangling the functions of government. Another round of Trump judges will finish us. Trump has promised to roll back Biden’s EV policies on ‘day one.’ Here’s why the embattled SEC chair is a hot-button presidential issue.

            "content": "By  Justine Calma, a senior science reporter covering energy and the environment with more than a decade of experience. She is also the host of Hell or High Water: When Disaster Hits Home, a podcast from Vox Media and Audible Originals. Jeff Bezos might just be the biggest climate philanthropist out there, which is what makes his swift embrace of Donald Trump as the next US president particularly cringeworthy. “Wishing @realDonaldTrump all success in leading and uniting the America we all love,” Bezos posted on X, hours after Trump declared victory. The Amazon founder and chair launched his Bezos Earth Fund in 2020, committing $10 billion to funding action on climate change. The fund’s website describes it as “the largest philanthropic commitment ever to fight climate change and protect nature.”  “Earth is the one thing we all have in common — let’s protect it, together,” Bezos wrote on Instagram when he announced the fund. He stepped down from his post as Amazon CEO in 2021 to focus on the fund, The Washington Post, and his other “passions.” (Bezos reportedly killed The Washington Post’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris.) President-elect Trump, meanwhile, says rising sea levels — which make storms and flooding more dangerous thanks to climate change — simply mean “you’ll have more ocean front property.” On the campaign trail, he disparaged solutions like renewable energy — pushing misinformation like the myth that offshore wind farms are killing whales along US shorelines. He consistently downplays the risks posed by climate change, even as the US reels from disasters like Hurricane Helene that were supercharged by greenhouse gas emissions. During his first term in office, Trump rolled back more than 100 environmental regulations, placed fossil fuel lobbyists in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency, and briefly pulled the US out of the international Paris agreement to stop climate change.  While the US dropped the ball on climate action at the federal level, local leaders and even the private sector attempted to fill in the gaps. During the last couple of years of Trump’s first term, a wave of big tech companies made commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions — ostensibly in line with what’s needed to reach Paris climate agreement goals.  One of the early companies to do so was Amazon, which set a goal in 2019 of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. Fast-forward to 2023, and the company still produced 34 percent more carbon pollution than it did when it made its first climate pledge — although its emissions have started to come back down slightly, according to Amazon’s latest sustainability report. Since its inception, the Bezos Earth Fund has given $2 billion in grants to a wide array of projects — from protecting forests to tracking planet-heating methane pollution by satellite. To be sure, the fund has faced some criticism over the years about Amazon’s own pollution and over how effective and equitable some of the programs it supports have been. Over time, though, the fund has started to funnel more money into grassroots groups working to ensure that there are more diverse voices being heard when it comes to finding solutions. (The Bezos Earth Fund didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment from The Verge.) Under another Trump presidency, locally led climate action and philanthropy become even more crucial again. Upon stepping back into office, Trump is expected to introduce a landslide of new policies that would slow the transition to cleaner energy needed to keep climate disasters from growing much worse.  Notably, he said he’d rescind unspent funds from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that set aside $369 billion for energy efficiency initiatives and the domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles and clean energy technologies. The Inflation Reduction Act alone is projected to slash greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40 percent from 2005 levels by the end of the decade — bringing the US close to reaching goals President Joe Biden set upon recommitting the US to the Paris climate agreement.  Another Trump presidency, on the other hand, would likely increase US greenhouse gas emissions by 4 billion metric tons compared to Biden’s plans, according to a Carbon Brief analysis published before Harris became the Democratic candidate. Trump has also said that he’d take the US out of the Paris accord again.  Bezos certainly isn’t the only tech mogul to kiss the ring since Trump’s win at the polls this week. Elon Musk has been one of Trump’s most influential hype men. Apple’s Tim Cook, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, Google’s Sundar Pichai, and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella have all extended their congratulations, to name a few. The president-elect has responded well to flattery in the past, after all — offering Musk his own “efficiency” task force to run. And Trump frequently threatens his critics with retribution. All the bromance could really just be a strategic play on the part of Bezos and other billionaires to protect their bottom lines. But that list represents a lot of money and power that could either help keep climate goals alive or fall in line behind a president who told Musk in August that “the biggest threat is nuclear warming … To me, the biggest problem is not climate change.”  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

She spent 5 years covering tech policy at CNBC, writing about antitrust, privacy, and content moderation reform. Federal Communications Commission chair Jessica Rosenworcel rejected former President Donald Trump’s call to revoke CBS’s broadcast license on Thursday, calling it a familiar threat that “should not be ignored.” Trump called for the license to be revoked after the network shared two different edits of a recent 60 Minutes interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump criticized the interview as “a giant Fake News Scam” in a Truth Social post on Thursday and claimed the network replaced her answer on a question about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “in order to save her or, at least, make her look better.”  Trump shared a compilation of two versions of Harris’ answer to the question, with one labeled “actual answer” and the other labeled “edited answer,” even though both were shared by CBS. One was shared by the 60 Minutes X account in a teaser, while the other depicts a version that appeared in CBS’s transcript of the full interview. CBS did not immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment. “TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE,” he added. “Election Interference.” “While repeated attacks against broadcast stations by the former President may now be familiar, these threats against free speech are serious and should not be ignored,” Rosenworcel said in a statement. “As I’ve said before, the First Amendment is a cornerstone of our democracy. The FCC does not and will not revoke licenses for broadcast stations simply because a political candidate disagrees with or dislikes content or coverage.” If this sounds familiar, it’s because Rosenworcel rejected a similar call from Trump in September. That time, Trump objected to ABC’s moderation and fact-checking of the presidential debate.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

She is also the host of Hell or High Water: When Disaster Hits Home, a podcast from Vox Media and Audible Originals. Amazon says that it has gotten rid of plastic air pillows at its warehouses. “As of October 2024, we’ve removed all plastic air pillows from our delivery packaging used at our global fulfillment centers,” the e-commerce giant said in an October 9th blog post.  It’s a welcome change following years of pressure from environmental groups to stop plastic pollution flooding into oceans. The company is still working to reduce the use of single-use plastics more broadly in its packaging.  “Fantastic news for the world’s oceans” “The fact that the world’s largest e-commerce company has made plastic air pillows history globally is fantastic news for the world’s oceans,” Matt Littlejohn, senior vice president of strategic initiatives at the nonprofit Oceana, said in a statement in response to Amazon’s announcement. The most prolific type of plastic litter near coastlines is plastic film — a material that makes up those once ubiquitous air pillows, according to Oceana. That film also happens to be the “deadliest” type of plastic pollution for large mammals like whales and dolphins that might ingest it, Oceana says. Amazon’s announcement comes after it pledged in June to get rid of plastic air pillows in North America by the end of the year. The company swapped out plastic air pillows and single-use delivery bags for paper and cardboard alternatives in Europe in 2022. It also ditched plastic film packaging at its facilities in India in 2020.  The US is Amazon’s largest market, and the company hasn’t managed to fully eliminate plastic packaging in North America just yet. It says it plans to reduce the amount of deliveries containing “Amazon-added plastic delivery packaging” in North America to just one-third of shipments by December, down from two-thirds in December 2023.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Has there ever been a presidential election so totally obsessed with the American auto industry?  Sure, past campaigns have made glancing reference to the storied auto sector, mostly as a stand-in for popular tropes like American ingenuity and hard work. But this election feels different. The combination of Michigan, the home of the Big Three automakers (Ford, GM, and Stellantis), as a crucial swing state and the historic shift toward electric vehicles, has put the industry in the red-hot center of an already unpredictable presidential race.   Joe Biden kicked things off early on by making EVs the centerpiece of his administration’s efforts to fight climate change. That included billions of dollars for new charging infrastructure, tax credits for buyers, and billions more for manufacturers looking to build new factories (or retrofit old ones). The president, a self-professed car guy, even got behind the wheel of an electric Ford truck to demonstrate his commitment to these cleaner, less-polluting vehicles. (“That sucker,” the president declared, “is quick.”)  Naturally, this all got distilled and distorted through the right-wing media woodchipper as a government mandate to purchase electric vehicles and a ban on our beloved gas cars. Former President Donald Trump and the Republican apparatus seized on what they saw as trepidation among consumers about EV range and high prices and turned that into a message of government overreach. After all, EVs could be cold and digital, while the pistons firing under the hoods of gas cars had all the patriotic fervor of a firework display.  Trump spent most of the year ridiculing EVs on the campaign trail, claiming they would “kill” the American auto industry and “assassinate” jobs. The United Auto Workers strike over the summer added fuel to the fire, with many workers expressing unease about the shift. Trump declared that the Biden administration “ordered a hit job on Michigan manufacturing” by encouraging the sale of electric cars. (Language that now seems weirdly prescient given the multiple recent attempts on his life.) And he’s promised to reverse Biden’s policies on “day one” if elected in November.  To be sure, the Democrats’ plan was a familiar neoliberal mash-up of tax credits and abatements aimed at getting people who are already well off to spend a little more on an expensive EV in the hopes that sales volume would eventually help cool prices. Republicans could have had a reasonable counter message about excessive spending to help the rich better afford cool cars but instead ended up settling on Trump’s fever dream distortions.  The swift politicization of EVs took many by surprise The swift politicization of EVs took many by surprise, including the people in charge of making them: “I never thought the propulsion system on a vehicle would be [political],” General Motors CEO Mary Barra recently told CBS News Sunday Morning. Ford CEO Jim Farley penned a LinkedIn post about how much he loves EVs and his belief that they should have “nothing to do with politics.”  Of course, it’s naive to think that anything that happens in America in the 21st century can be completely divorced from politics. The type of car you buy has always been a signifier of certain core beliefs. Pickup trucks are Republican-coded, much in the same way the Toyota Prius is often associated with coastal liberals.  Politics has always been ingrained in the car business. The federal government regulates safety, while drivers are licensed by states. But more than that, the government uses its policy-making powers to steer consumers to certain desired outcomes, just as regulations force manufacturers to adopt preferred technologies. And these policies originate from certain beliefs, such as the certainty that climate change is a very real threat and tailpipe pollution is a major contributor. Earlier this year, the Environmental Protection Agency adopted new rules aimed at slashing greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2032. EVs would need to account for over half of new vehicle sales for automakers to meet these strict mandates. Trump claims to believe that people should have the freedom to drive whatever car they want, regardless of the environmental impact. To him, rising sea levels imply more desirable “oceanfront property.” But beliefs are malleable, and politics is fickle. Tesla owners who thought they were making an environmentally conscious choice are now stuck driving totems to Elon Musk’s quixotic turn to the right. And the Tesla CEO’s slavish support for Trump has helped to soften the former president’s stance on EVs. No longer are they stealthy job assassins — now, Trump lauds them as “incredible,” if not for everyone.  The Tesla CEO’s slavish support for Trump has helped to soften the former president’s stance on EVs Polls show that support for EVs splits along party lines. Democrats continue to funnel billions into EV infrastructure, even as sales growth slows and manufacturers suddenly balk at the aggressive stance they themselves took when EVs seemed poised to take over the world. Plug-in hybrids are now the new fad. Trump says that, if elected, no state would be allowed to ban internal combustion engines.  Out on the campaign trail, Vice President Kamala Harris has kept EVs — and indeed the entire Biden climate legacy — at an arm’s length, instead talking about her support for fracking as she attempts to court the must-win state of Pennsylvania. Her shift to the center has left EVs in a bit of a chilly spot.  Harris has been tough to pin down on EVs. She knows that Biden’s embrace didn’t quite pay off for him politically. EVs poll poorly in battleground states, including Michigan. And now that Trump has Musk giddily hopping around onstage for him like a marionette, Trump’s free to ramp up his attacks, pouring money into ads that falsely claim that Harris wants to “end all gas cars.” After weeks of dodging the issue, Harris addressed it head-on in a speech in Flint, Michigan: “Let us be clear,” she said, “contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive.”  Only 3 in 10 Americans said they would consider an EV for their next purchase, and support is dropping, according to the Pew Research Center. Pew cites a familiar set of concerns around charging, range anxiety, and prices. Another recent study says the number of Americans that actually believe EVs are better for the planet than gas-powered cars is also dropping. The US has spent billions of dollars to push EVs, and the needle is barely moving. In May 2024, EVs represented 6.8 percent of overall car sales in the US, down from 8.8 percent of total sales in 2023.   With growth flatlining, Biden’s emphasis on EVs as the key weapon against climate change is looking misplaced, especially when compared to the multi-decade investments that paved the way for China to claim the EV crown. China has cracked the code on cheap EVs, with several models selling for $20,000 or less.  The only country producing EVs is our enemy in a new cold war In the US, the average EV transaction is still north of $50,000. If Chinese EV makers like Geely and BYD are allowed to sell them in the US, industry soothsayers warn it could usher in the end of the Big Three. It’s a paradox: we need EVs to reduce emissions, and they need to be cheap so people can buy them, but the only country producing them is our enemy in a new cold war.  Neither Harris nor Trump seems to have much in the way of solutions to China except more tariffs and more protectionist trade policies. Americans need cheap EVs, and China has plenty to sell. But if there’s anything that Trump, Biden, and Harris can all agree on, it’s that you will never be allowed to buy one.  Weirdly, EVs have sucked up so much airtime, we really have no clue about either candidate’s position on the rest of transportation. If you search their policy platforms online, you won’t find any mention of important issues like infrastructure, aviation, public transit, or urban planning.  But since the past is prologue, we can make some educated guesses. Harris likely supports the Biden administration’s efforts to clean up the transportation network by investing in electrification, while also focusing on walkable cities and environmental justice initiatives. Meanwhile, Trump seems poised to eliminate funding for public transportation and would continue funding highway expansion projects, as outlined in the notorious Project 2025 document. But until we know the result of the election, we won’t know for sure.  What seems certain, though, is that whoever wins will have a huge impact on the next car you buy.    / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Elizabeth Lopatto, a reporter who writes about tech, money, and human behavior. She joined The Verge in 2014 as science editor. Previously, she was a reporter at Bloomberg.  It is my personal belief that no normal person should know the name of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s chair, and yet here I am, about to explain why he’s been an issue in the 2024 presidential election. The man in question is Gary Gensler, an economist who formerly worked at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As SEC chair, he has been on the receiving end of death threats. Former President and current Republican nominee Donald Trump made a campaign promise to “fire Gary Gensler” to the raucous approval of a packed arena at this year’s Bitcoin Conference. Though blockchain enthusiasts have been the most vocal in their displeasure, the controversy around Gensler isn’t limited to them. The Economist has dubbed Gensler “the most controversial man in American finance”; House Democrats and Republicans have expressed “stern displeasure” on Gensler’s crypto approach. You could say he is unpopular. Many industries dislike their regulators. It is arguably the job of the SEC commissioner to be somewhat unpopular! And the cryptocurrency industry’s revulsion for Gensler is unsurprising after a series of SEC enforcements, including against major companies and exchanges. But Gensler himself became a contentious, oddly partisan issue on the level of presidential politics. And the story gets more complicated from there because this is not a cut-and-dried case of a regulator being persecuted by the industry for doing his job. Gensler is also unpopular among his own staff, though not for any reasons that will get thousands of people roaring inside a convention center.  It’s unusual for the SEC to be a hot-button issue — even during the 2008 financial crisis, the SEC chair wasn’t exactly a well-known figure. (The chair at the time was Christopher Cox. Yes, literally who.) But the SEC has become politically heated because Gensler wanted it to be, says Adam Pritchard, a professor of securities law at the University of Michigan. “He wanted to raise the profile of the agency,” says Pritchard, pointing to what he says is “an ambitious rulemaking agenda.” Let’s review some very recent history: Gensler’s time at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the agency that regulates derivatives markets. Gensler was in charge of the CFTC in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, during which he successfully convinced Congress to include, as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, new rules involving swaps (a type of financial derivative that was implicated in the crisis) that put them under the purview of the CFTC. His approach at that agency was described using words such as “hard-charging” and “aggressive.”  Before Dodd-Frank, the CFTC’s oversight was just the $35 trillion futures market; after, it was responsible for the $400 trillion swaps market as well. But taking on new duties also meant a lot of new work. The CFTC had to write a lot of new rules, and real people had to clock in hours to make that happen. On top of that, his enforcement chief filed “a record number of cases” against Wall Street banks. As a result of the speed and confusion with which the CFTC was working, the staff had to issue “130 exemptions or no-action letters,” essentially saying no enforcement action should be taken despite the existence of a new rule. He built up a reputation as a micromanager Under Gensler’s leadership, the CFTC outspent its budget and sometimes had to put employees on unpaid leave. At the same time, he built up a reputation as a micromanager. Gensler “routinely demanded that staff work weekends and holidays,” according to the Partnership for Public Service, which named the CFTC as one of the worst places in government to work while Gensler was at the helm.  Gensler’s management style left much to be desired; it also left the CFTC with a considerable amount of unoccupied real estate. Office space at the CFTC surged by almost 75 percent during his tenure. “Gensler signed leases across the country, assuming he would be able to fill the offices with new staff,” noted Fortune. But the funding for that staff never came, and by 2016, a fifth of the agency’s headquarters in DC remained unoccupied — as did almost a third of the New York office.  The playbook Gensler has been using at the SEC looks similar. Here, too, he’s been known for his hard-driving ethos. His two highest-profile issues, environmental disclosures and crypto, have earned him enemies in the Republican Party.  Under the SEC’s new rules around environmental disclosures, companies are required to disclose risks related to climate change. (Those rules have been paused in the face of an onslaught of lawsuits — part of a larger-scale attack on the regulatory state via the courts.)  “I don’t imagine a lot of voters are up in arms about public companies being forced to disclose the impact their policies have on the environment,” says Marc Fagel, who spent more than a decade at the SEC and who is now a lecturer at Stanford Law School. But because Republicans have been complaining about “ESG,” and “woke Wall Street,” this otherwise anodyne set of rules is now part of the culture wars.   But it’s Gensler’s record on crypto that makes his haters really froth at the mouth.  The division between the CFTC and the SEC is peculiar; in most other countries, there’s just one financial regulator. That division is a crucial part of the crypto story; the industry’s preferred regulator is the CFTC. But in the absence of a congressional mandate, a turf war has ensued, with the SEC filing enforcement actions against Coinbase and Binance, two of the largest exchanges, in 2023, claiming the exchanges allowed users to trade unregistered securities.  The SEC under both Gensler and his predecessor had some significant wins; it litigated or settled almost 200 crypto cases since 2017, Gensler told Barron’s in May. In March, a judge found that the suit against Coinbase could go forward — saying the SEC had sufficiently shown “that Coinbase operates as an exchange, as a broker, and as a clearing agency under the federal securities laws, and, through its Staking Program, engages in the unregistered offer and sale of securities.” Gensler has said outright that crypto is “rife with fraud, scams, bankruptcies and money laundering” Meanwhile, Gensler has said outright that crypto is “rife with fraud, scams, bankruptcies and money laundering” — not in and of itself a controversial opinion but one that maybe comes off a touch more outspoken than the typical federal bureaucrat. Maybe to drive the point home, he’s taken a number of crypto companies to task with enforcement actions, which include but are not limited to lawsuits. This is a sore point for the crypto industry, which has complained that the SEC isn’t making rules, just punishing companies, and doing so without providing clear guidance about how to avoid punishment. When the crypto exchange Coinbase requested that the SEC draft comprehensive rules for the crypto industry, the SEC rejected its petition. Coinbase then filed a legal challenge, saying the SEC’s denial was “arbitrary and capricious,” one of the legal standards for overturning an agency action.  Before I say more, let’s go over that again: one of the biggest crypto exchanges asked for more regulation, and then the regulatory agency in question — run by a man who says crypto is full of scams and frauds — said no. That seems pretty absurd on the face of it. Keep in mind, however, that there’s some weird legal crossfire in the timeline. Coinbase’s suit against the SEC over rulemaking was happening at the same time as the SEC’s suit against Coinbase over unregistered securities. And on top of that, there’s an additional complication: regulation just isn’t what it used to be. “The conservative judiciary has limited rulemaking,” says Fagel, the former SEC staffer. (The Supreme Court kneecapped regulators earlier this summer as part of an ongoing trend toward disempowering federal agencies.) “Yes, the SEC could spend three years concocting an entire regulatory regime for crypto. There would be a lawsuit in an hour.”  “Yes, the SEC could spend three years concocting an entire regulatory regime for crypto. There would be a lawsuit in an hour.” It might be more realistic to think of Coinbase’s suit as not asking for regulation per se, but as asking for regulation that Coinbase likes. Because if Coinbase doesn’t like said regulation, it’ll sue. Meanwhile, the courts have tended to back the SEC when it sues or takes enforcement actions — as opposed to rulemaking or other agency decision-making — so, rationally speaking, it’s just good sense for the SEC to focus on doing the things that judges let them do.  Gensler’s approach would be defensible, except that the SEC hasn’t abandoned rulemaking. In just the first eight months of 2022, the SEC proposed more than twice as many new rules as in 2021, and more than had been proposed annually for the last five years, according to an SEC inspector general report.  “There’s no question that the rulemaking initiatives have come fast and furious since he took over at the SEC,” says Pritchard. That means that the number of challenges to the rules has also spiked. Crafting rules that will withstand challenges is time-intensive, creating a feedback loop of more work for the staff, Pritchard says. This is the part that makes Gensler’s SEC start to look a lot like Gensler’s CFTC, and not in a good way. As a result of the pace of rulemaking, attrition rates at the SEC were the highest in 10 years, the 2022 inspector general report said. Managers told the SEC inspector general that it had been harder to hire people with experience, so the agency was relying on temporary workers, “in some cases with little or no experience in rulemaking.”  According to the SEC union, staff have been leaving “at more than twice the rate prior to Gensler’s arrival, and the pace of departures is continuing to accelerate.” The people who were most likely to leave were the most experienced. The SEC staff has experienced benefit cuts, which the union chalks up to “a series of budget decisions made by Chair Gensler,” who chose to increase spending, betting that Congress would increase the SEC’s budget. “In effect, Chair Gensler wagered with your compensation and benefits, knowing that his staff would suffer the consequences if he lost the bet,” the union told its membership. (Congress did not increase the SEC’s budget, and Gensler did in fact lose this bet.)  The union has also decried Gensler’s “irrational hostility” to remote work, adding that “the union is being forced to litigate issues like this more frequently under Chair Gensler than under any previous SEC Chairman.” Overwork and staff attrition have heavy consequences when you’re the literal government. In March 2024, SEC attorneys were sanctioned by a judge for “gross abuse of power” in a crypto case involving a company called Digital Licensing (or, more familiarly, Debt Box). Following the sanctions, the Salt Lake City offices of the SEC were closed because of “significant attrition” — and while the Debt Box fiasco wasn’t the only reason it closed, it did play a role. Attorney sanctions are relatively rare, and sanctions of government lawyers are even more so.  The SEC chair term lasts five years, meaning Gensler’s time is up in June 2026. But regardless of who is elected, Gensler’s tenure may not continue into the next administration. Gensler has said he would “absolutely” stay for a second term under Biden, when Biden was still the Democratic nominee. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has targeted him specifically, with the former president saying he would “fire” Gensler. Vice President Kamala Harris’ donors have also been pushing to get rid of Gensler. Her exact stance on Gensler as a regulator isn’t clear, but Gensler is closely associated with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and the relationship between Warren and Harris has been tense. Legally, the president can fire SEC chairs — but the chair then becomes a normal SEC commissioner. In that case, they can only be removed for cause, says Anne Joseph O’Connell, a law professor at Stanford Law School. (Typically, though, chairs resign when a new party is elected, while the regular commissioners carry on.) It’s unclear what would happen in the case of a Harris administration — intraparty transitions don’t happen very often. Gensler is a symptom, not the disease It’s funny. There’s reason to think that Gensler is, in fact, bad at his job. But when the crypto industry calls for Gensler to get fired, it’s probably not because it’s concerned about the work-life balance of the SEC staff. The same people who want Gensler’s head on a platter are the least likely people in America to find common cause with the SEC union. And given the polarization in American politics, when Gensler is demonized by the crypto industry (and lumped in with the actually effective Lina Khan by the business class), he comes out looking good to a certain set of half-informed liberals. The real story here is the paralyzed regulatory state. The legislative chambers that could have increased the SEC’s budget and mitigated its problems of too much rulemaking with too little staff are gridlocked. (Maybe Gensler’s chaotic leadership would have rendered that a null effort, but it’s hard to say for sure.) As for the problems with what is sometimes termed “regulation by enforcement,” that’s exactly the incentive structure the right wing has set up by kneecapping agencies’ abilities to set rules. Gensler is a symptom, not the disease. When the SEC makes rules, it gets tied up in court, and so even when the industry wants rules, it’s not going to get them. Strong regulation isn’t nearly as dangerous for corporations as unpredictability is. Go ahead and fire Gensler — who cares? The next SEC chair isn’t going to be able to set predictable guidelines, either.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Gaby Del Valle, a policy reporter. Her past work has focused on immigration politics, border surveillance technologies, and the rise of the New Right. Former President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency project, World Liberty Financial, launched its token sale on Tuesday — and its website crashed shortly afterward. The white list for the much hyped but still largely unexplained decentralized finance project opened on September 30th for accredited investors and non-US persons. World Liberty Financial cofounder Zachary Folkman claimed on Monday that “well over 100,000 people” had signed up to buy its token WLFI, according to CNBC. As of publication time, the site appeared to be back online. However, according to blockchain data tracked by Etherscan, just 5,317 unique wallet addresses held the token as of Tuesday afternoon, and World Liberty Financial said it sold more than 532 million tokens of the 20 billion made available for public sale. Sandy Peng, a WLFI adviser, told CoinDesk that the outages resulted from excessive traffic. “The team wasn’t expecting this level of interest,” Peng said, adding that the website received 72 million unique visits in the first hour after the token launched. CoinDesk reports that the WLFI token, which will be nontransferrable for now, will be used to govern the World Liberty Financial platform. Holders will be able to have a say in protocol upgrades, technical changes, promotional partnerships, and oversight of security risks. The platform itself will let users borrow and lend cryptocurrency. Despite Trump and his associates’ promotion of World Liberty Financial as a tool to help unbanked and debanked people, only those who meet the Securities and Exchange Commission’s accredited investor requirements can purchase WLFI. To qualify as an accredited investor, a person must have an income of at least $200,000 (or $300,000 with a spouse) and / or a net worth of at least $1 million, excluding their primary residence. World Liberty Financial released a so-called “gold paper” about the token on Tuesday, which lists Trump as the “chief crypto associate.” His three sons — Eric, Donald Trump Jr., and Barron — are listed as “Web3 Ambassadors.”  According to the paper, the World Liberty Financial protocol “plans to provide users with information and access to third-party DeFi applications, including third party digital wallet providers for acquiring, holding, and transferring stable coins, and non-security digital assets.” Notably, the paper says that the tokens “ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR U.S. PERSONS” and “HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED WITH ANY U.S. OR OTHER AUTHORITY.”  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Microsoft’s OneDrive cloud storage service is getting an improved search experience, a new mobile app, colored folders in File Explorer, and much more in the weeks ahead. Starting today, Copilot in OneDrive will now be available to all of Microsoft’s commercial customers. “Our improved search experience is a game-changer,” says Jason Moore, vice president of product for OneDrive. “With new filter controls and more detailed results, find the exact file or folder faster and easier—whether it’s stored in your OneDrive, a shared library, or a folder from a teammate.”  Microsoft says it’s giving this OneDrive search experience “a major performance boost,” with faster launch times for the storage service, too. The search update is rolling out now and will be available to OneDrive commercial customers by the end of 2024. Starting today, Windows File Explorer will now support the colored folders inside OneDrive. If you’ve previously set colored folders on the web version of OneDrive, then you’ll start to see these show up in File Explorer. Microsoft is also planning to make “significant improvements to the document library experience” of OneDrive by mid-2025. “We’re improving the overall performance and reliability, making it easier and faster to navigate, switch to and create custom views, and filter large data sets,” says Moore. A new OneDrive app is also on the way for iOS and Android users. “The updated mobile app puts your photos front and center, with easy-to-navigate albums, people, and favorites,” says Moore. There’s also an improved AI-powered photo search that lets you use natural language to find photos. This means you can search how you speak, so things like “a dog on a boat” will return the photos you’re looking for. This new OneDrive app will also surface memories, trips, and birthdays on the homepage. Microsoft is also making it easy to import photos from other cloud services with the OneDrive mobile app. You can import photos, videos, and documents from Google Drive, Google Photos, and Dropbox.  This new OneDrive mobile app is rolling out to Android users starting today, with a new iOS version arriving in November. This photo search feature is rolling out to Microsoft 365 subscribers first, before being available to all users by summer 2025. Copilot is also launching inside of OneDrive today for all commercial users. Copilot Agents are coming to OneDrive, too, so you can have a custom-built AI assistant to handle all your folder needs. The latest changes to OneDrive come a year after Microsoft held a similar event for its cloud storage service last year. Microsoft has added a Fluent design refresh, AI-powered Copilot features, folder colors, and the ability to favorite OneDrive files over the past year.  Microsoft is also planning further changes to OneDrive in the future. The updated photos experience is coming to every platform, including PC, web, and macOS. Microsoft Designer will also be integrated into OneDrive in the future, allowing users to easily edit photos quickly.  OneDrive’s future AI features also include personalized views, which automatically group your files and photos based on moments, hobbies, or collections. Microsoft is even planning to integrate one-click AI actions like summarization and file comparison directly into File Explorer and macOS’s Finder soon.

His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Rivian’s R2 vehicles will be powered by batteries made domestically in the US by South Korea’s LG Energy Solution, the company announced in its third quarter earnings report.  Rivian first revealed the new batteries back in March when it announced the R2 as its more affordable electric SUV that would start at $45,000. (It also announced the sportier R3 vehicle.) The cell is called “4695” due to its diameter of 46 millimeters and height of 95 millimeters — larger than Tesla’s 4680 cells. The battery packs that Rivian currently uses in its R1T and R1S vehicles are assembled at its Normal, Illinois, factory using cells manufactured in South Korea by Samsung SDI. Now, the cells will be produced in the US to better comply with tax credit requirements outlined by the Inflation Reduction Act. In a letter to shareholders, Rivian said the cells would be manufactured during their first year at LG’s plant in Queen Creek, Arizona.  The next-gen battery pack will be lighter, less complex, and cheaper to produce than the current batteries, Rivian said. The company also expects a “meaningful reduction in dollar per kilowatt hour (kWh) at the pack level when compared to the R1 platform.” And because it’s larger than its R1 batteries, the new packs will contain fewer cells overall, which will make the manufacturing process more efficient. Rivian says it expects the assembly process to improve by 45 percent.  Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, automakers have been scrambling to shift EV battery manufacturing to the US to comply with rules requiring domestic production in order to qualify for generous subsidies. And with President-elect Donald Trump coming back into office, they will need to work even faster in order to avoid harsh tariffs on imported goods that the incoming president has promised to enact.  LG Energy Solution makes EV batteries for a number of legacy automakers, too. The company’s joint venture with General Motors received a $2.5 billion loan from the Department of Energy in 2022 to help construct a new lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility. Rivian has said the R2 will go into production during the first half of 2026. But with Trump also promising to eliminate President Joe Biden’s EV subsidies, the question remains whether struggling EV-only companies like Rivian will be able to stay afloat amid what’s expected to be a more uncertain market.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. For almost as long as he’s been CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk has been bullshitting us about self-driving cars.  In 2016, he said Tesla self-driving cars were “two years away.” A year later, it was “six months, definitely,” and customers would be able to actually sleep in their Tesla in “two years.” In 2018, it was still a “year away” and would be “200 percent safer” than human driving. In 2019, he said there would be “feature complete full self-driving this year.” There hasn’t been a year go by without Musk promising the imminent arrival of a fully driverless Tesla.  This week, it’s finally here. Or at least that’s what Musk says. On October 10th, Tesla will reveal its long-awaited “robotaxi,” a supposedly fully autonomous vehicle that Musk has said will catapult the company into trillion-dollar status. It will be some combination of “Uber and Airbnb,” Musk said during a recent earnings call, allowing Tesla owners to serve as landlords for their driverless cars as they roam about the cityscape, picking up and dropping off strangers. And it will be futuristic in its design, with Bloomberg reporting that it will be a two-seater with butterfly wing doors. Musk has been calling it the “Cybercab.” The event, which will be held on the film lot of Warner Bros. in Burbank, California, will be the culmination of almost a decade of blown deadlines and broken promises from Musk, a moment when the richest man in the world will finally be forced to stop hiding behind his own bluster and actually show us what he’s been working on.  It’s a vulnerable time for Tesla. The company’s sales slumped in the first half of the year, as rising competition in the US and China dimmed Tesla’s star. Musk is fighting to reclaim his enormous $56 billion pay package, all while spreading misinformation on his social media platform and stumping for former President Donald Trump. And now there’s this product event, Tesla’s first since the unveiling of the Cybertruck in 2019.  Almost a decade of blown deadlines and broken promises Based on past Tesla events, don’t expect Musk to follow through on all his promises.  It seems likely that we’ll see a cool demo of a stylish-looking prototype, allowing Musk to claim a kind of victory for first impressions, even when the rough outlines of what he promises will barely hold up to scrutiny. The exaltations from bullish investors will give him enough cover to continue to make misleading declarations about what is and isn’t autonomous. And the safety experts and competitors who try to warn about the dangers of his approach will likely be drowned out or dismissed by his most ardent fans.  But either it works or it doesn’t. Waymo and others have already shown the world what real driverless technology looks like. It’s imperfect and it’s limited, but it’s undeniable. If Musk fails to deliver or shows off some obvious vaporware, his reputation — and Tesla’s stock price — could take a real hit.  “He’s really grasping for straws,” said Mary “Missy” Cummings, a robotics expert and former senior safety official at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. “He’s so desperate to try to drive more money into this equation that he’s doing things like this [event].” I first started covering Tesla for The Verge in 2016, the same year that Musk made one of his first predictions about the imminent arrival of self-driving cars. “You’ll be able to summon your car from across the country,” he said, citing as an example a Tesla owner beckoning their vehicle to drive solo from New York to meet him in Los Angeles. The company went even further in a blog post, boasting that “all Tesla vehicles produced in our factory — including Model 3 — will have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than a human driver.” That post has since been deleted from Tesla’s site, along with the company’s first “Master Plan,” as Musk attempts to scrub Tesla’s past of all his overreaching pronouncements.  “Substantially greater than a human driver” But more importantly, these kinds of statements fooled a lot of people into thinking the shiny new electric car in their driveway would have everything they needed to be fully autonomous and that those futuristic capabilities were just around the corner. Elon Musk would flip the switch and — presto — millions of cars would suddenly transform into robots. The media bought into it, portraying Tesla as being on the cusp of a historical evolution. And soon enough, the company’s stock started reflecting this attitude, especially after Tesla defied expectations with the Model 3.  Of course, none of it was true. Nearly a decade later, no Tesla vehicle on the road today is autonomous. Sure, the company has rolled out a series of brashly branded driver-assist features — first Autopilot, then Navigate on Autopilot, then Full Self-Driving, and finally Full Self-Driving (Supervised) — but they do not enable the car to drive without constant human supervision. You can’t sleep in your Tesla. You can’t summon it across town, let alone across the country. If you crash, you will be liable for what happens and who gets hurt. And if you attempt to fight the company on any of that, you will probably lose.  You can’t sleep in your Tesla Even those Tesla owners lured into thinking their vehicles were incognito robots would soon realize the cost of the company’s obfuscations. In 2021, Tesla first started offering subscriptions to its long-awaited Full Self-Driving feature, including a $1,500 hardware upgrade for those early owners who were wrongly informed that their vehicle would have “the hardware needed” for full autonomy. (It was later lowered to $1,000 after customer outcry.) There are plenty of people using Full Self-Driving (Supervised) today who will happily tell you how great it is and how they can’t imagine life without it. (Many also have YouTube channels they want to promote.) They will also argue over the semantics of autonomy. Shouldn’t something that controls the acceleration, braking, steering, and navigation also get to be called autonomous?  In the absence of data from Tesla, it’s impossible to say how good or terrible FSD is with any certainty. Crowd-sourced projects like FSD Community Tracker are extremely limited, only featuring data on a scant 200,000 miles of driving. Tesla says over 1 billion miles have been driven using FSD. But even the tracker’s tiny snapshot of data shows 119 miles between critical disengagements. Waymo drove 17,000 miles between disengagements in 2023, according to the California DMV.  While Tesla chased a much broader vision, Waymo leapt forward by realizing something more workable: remove the driver entirely and restrict the geography in which the vehicle can operate. Google, from which Waymo spun out in 2016, has long argued that advanced driver-assistance systems like Autopilot and FSD were inherently problematic. After all, human supervisors get bored and eventually zone out. The handoff between the vehicle and the driver can be fraught. It’s better to just cut the human out of the equation altogether.  Tesla is now latching onto Waymo’s better vision in unveiling a fully autonomous vehicle, the robotaxi. This is the vehicle that can silence all of those doubters. After all, Waymo doesn’t sell cars; it sells a service. Tesla sells cars. And wouldn’t it be infinitely cooler to own your own self-driving vehicle?  Tesla likes to say that Autopilot — and later FSD — is saving lives. In fact, Musk has gone even further, declaring any criticism of its driver-assistance products amounts to murder. “You need to think carefully about this,” he said in 2016, “because if, in writing some article that’s negative, you effectively dissuade people from using an autonomous vehicle, you’re killing people.” At the same time, he said that Tesla had no plans to assume legal liability for crashes or deaths that occurred when Autopilot was in use unless it was “something endemic to our design.” Even in the annals of Musk quotes that have aged poorly, these rank up there. At the time, only one person had died while using Autopilot — a reflection, perhaps, of the small number of Tesla vehicles on the road. Now, there are over 2 million Teslas all over the globe and a substantially higher number of deaths.  “Something endemic to our design” Presently, federal regulators are investigating at least 1,000 individual Tesla crashes involving Autopilot and FSD. Of those crashes, at least 44 people died. Investigators found that Autopilot — and, in some cases, FSD — was not designed to keep the driver engaged in the task of driving. Drivers would become overly complacent and lose focus. And when it came time to react, it was too late. Tesla has pushed out numerous updates to FSD over the years, so it can be tough to pin down what exactly is wrong with Tesla’s approach. Often, users flag a problem — the vehicle fails to recognize certain signage or a specific driving maneuver — and almost just as quickly, Tesla has an update available. That seems like a good thing — Tesla is responsive to problems and moves quickly to fix them — until you remember that real people’s lives are at stake. And the pedestrians and cyclists outside the vehicle never consented to participating in this experiment to teach cars to drive themselves.  Even the most recent version of the FSD software has its faults. An independent research firm recently tested versions 12.5.1 and 12.5.3 for over 1,000 miles and found it to be “surprisingly capable, while simultaneously problematic (and occasionally dangerously inept).” When errors occur, “they are occasionally sudden, dramatic, and dangerous.” In one instance, the group’s Tesla Model 3 ran a red light in the city during nighttime even though the cameras clearly detected the lights. FSD is the foundation for the robotaxi. Everything has been leading up to this moment. But the system struggles with basic perception issues, like wet roads and sunlight glare. FSD struggles to recognize motorcyclists: a 28-year-old motorcycle owner was killed outside of Seattle earlier this year by a Model S driver who was using the driver-assist feature.  The system struggles with basic perception issues Tesla used to publish quarterly safety reports that it would claim proved that Autopilot was safer than regular human driving — but it then stopped suddenly in 2022. It started up again this year with a new report that says there is only one crash for every 6.88 million miles of Autopilot-assisted driving, versus one for every 1.45 million miles of non-Autopilot driving. That’s over four times safer than normal human driving, according to Tesla.  This is the only safety data we have for Tesla’s driver-assist technology that is supposed to be a precursor to the fully autonomous robotaxi. But according to Noah Goodall, a civil engineer who has published several peer-reviewed studies about Tesla Autopilot, the company’s safety reports fail to take into account basic facts about traffic statistics, such as that crashes are more common on city roads and undivided roads than on the highway, where Autopilot is most often used. And it led him to the conclusion that Tesla may be miscounting crashes in order to make Autopilot seem safer than it actually is. “They fell apart pretty quickly, once you dove in just a little bit,” Goodall told me. “I have trouble publishing on this sometimes. Just because the reviewers are like, ‘Everyone knows these are fake, why are you pointing this out?’”  If there’s one thing on which everyone can agree, it’s that Tesla has a lot of data. With nearly 5 million drivers on the road globally, each vehicle is sending huge amounts of information back to the mothership for processing and labeling. Other companies, with only a fraction of the real-world miles, have to use simulated driving to fill in the gaps. But the sheer volume of data that Tesla is processing is overwhelming. The company relies on a small army of data annotators who review thousands of hours of footage from Tesla owners and the company’s in-house test drivers. And according to Business Insider, those workers are pushed to move quickly through as many images and videos as they can or face disciplinary action. Accuracy is secondary to speed.  “It’s a monumental effort,” Cummings, the robotics expert, said. “People think Teslas are learning on the fly. They have no idea how wrong they are, and just how much human preparation it takes to actually learn anything from the terabytes of data that are being gathered.” Tesla’s approach to the hardware of driverless vehicles also diverges from the rest of the industry. Musk infamously relies on a camera-only approach, in contrast to the widely used practice of relying on a “fusion” of different sensors, including radar, ultrasonic, and lidar, to power autonomous driving. Musk calls lidar, in particular, a “crutch” and claims any company that relies on the laser sensor is “doomed.” Waymo’s robotaxis are adorned with large, obvious sensors, a style expressly at odds with the sleekness of Musk’s vehicles.  Of course, Tesla does use lidar on its test vehicles, but just to validate FSD. They won’t be going on any customer cars, since lidar is still too expensive. With its tens of thousands of laser points projecting a second, lidar provides a critical layer of redundancy for the vehicle as well as a way to visualize the world in three dimensions.  The idea that you can introduce a fully autonomous vehicle without the full suite of sensors that power every other AV on earth strains credulity for most experts on the technology.  “Why on earth would you want to tie one hand behind your back when you’re solving an almost impossible problem?” said Phil Koopman, an AV expert from Carnegie Mellon University. “And we know it’s going to be big bucks, so don’t skimp on the hardware.” What is an autonomous car? It sounds like a simple question, but the answer is trickier than it seems. To help clear things up, SAE International, a US organization that represents automotive engineers, created a six-step guide to automation. Intended for engineers rather than the general public, it ranged from Level 0, meaning no automation whatsoever, to Level 5, meaning the vehicle can drive itself anywhere at any time without any human intervention. And there’s plenty of room for error and misunderstanding. A problem we’ve seen is what researcher Liza Dixon calls “autonowashing,” or any effort to overhype something as autonomous when it’s not.  Most experts dismiss Level 5 as pure science fiction. Waymo and others operate Level 4 vehicles, but very few people really believe that Level 5 is attainable. Level 5 would require “an astronomical amount of technological development, maintenance, and testing,” Torc Robotics, a company developing self-driving trucks, says. Others call it a pipe dream.  Except Musk. At a conference in Shanghai, Musk said with supreme confidence that the company “will have the basic functionality for Level 5 autonomy complete this year.” That was in July 2020. He’ll likely try to pass off the Tesla robotaxi as the endpoint of this achievement, the vehicle that will help usher in this wildly implausible goal. And it’s important to see through the bluster and bullshit and measure it against what he’s promised in the past and also what other players have already achieved.  Tesla’s history is littered with fanciful ideas that never panned out — like a solar-powered Supercharger network, battery swapping, or robotic snake-style chargers. But Musk never bet his entire company, his reputation, and most importantly, his net worth, on those projects. This one is different. And soon enough, we’ll know whether the Tesla robotaxi is the exception to the rule or just another guy dancing in a robot costume.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "OnePlus president Louis Lee recently took to Weibo (via Android Authority) to post an unexpected update on the successor to the OnePlus 12, one of our favorite phones this year. He announced that the OnePlus 13 will be available later this month. The October release of the latest OnePlus phone is just for China. Currently, there’s no word on when it will hit global markets. The OnePlus 12 was released in February 2024, which makes this update a fairly quick launch for the next generation of its flagship phone. Lee adds that the OnePlus 13 will sport the latest Snapdragon flagship chip, presumably the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, giving it a “big leap in both performance release and overall smoothness.” He goes as far as to say this phone will reach “a height never seen before on Android.” While we loved the OnePlus 12 for its camera, bigger battery, and wireless charging capabilities, we weren’t big fans of OxygenOS. The OnePlus 13 will be run on ColorOS15, which is a first for a OnePlus phone. Lee is hopeful the new OS will bring “unprecedented super performance, super performance scheduling, and a super smooth dynamic experience.” OnePlus is touting the new self-developed Tidal Engine and Aurora Engine on the ColorOS15 as its most important features, which will translate to a “revolutionary smooth experience” for users. It claims that the Tidal Engine can “schedule performance very efficiently” and the Aurora Engine can “completely reconstruct the underlying system, making the system dynamics smooth and agile.” While the OxygenOS on the OnePlus line used to be one of our favorites, our opinion of it changed when its aesthetics were melded with the ColorOS, resulting in a weird hybrid. We’re hopeful a complete revamp of the OS with the ColorOS15 completely taking over will fix that complaint. In another Weibo post in September (via Android Authority), Louis Lee lightly teased the display that could be on the OnePlus 13. He announced “the world’s first second-generation Oriental Screen” and added that it will “bring even more outstanding performance, and the effect will be far ahead” compared to the OnePlus 12. We were very impressed by the beefy 5,400mAh battery on the OnePlus 12, but the upcoming model will upgrade to 6,000mAh. The hope is that it also features wireless charging like its predecessor. According to tipsters, it looks like it will. Yogesh Brar predicts 100W wired and 50W wireless charging speeds on the phone. We don’t have word on pricing yet, but rumors suggest it will be similar to the OnePlus 12, which launched at $800. \nAndroidOnePlusSmartphones  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          You can say goodbye to the dreaded \"🥲 to 'why the hell aren’t emoji reacts working?’” from iOS to Android with RCS.\n         \n          The headset will likely be priced between $1,000 and $1,500 competing with both the Apple Vision Pro and the Meta Quest 3.\n         \n          See all the winners of Gizmodo's Best of 2024 Awards.\n         \n          Moments launches today on the iOS version of Netflix.

            "content": "Since The Office ended, Brian Baumgartner—who played the show’s subdued, perfunctory “Kevin Malone”—has made a second career for himself as one of the top earners on Cameo, the website that allows celebrities to leave personalized messages for fans. A report in 2021 claimed that Baumgartner had made over a million dollars through Cameo videos alone. Weirdly enough, it would appear that, in one case, Baumgartner’s friendly online videos accidentally contributed to an aggressive disinformation campaign aimed at toppling the current president of Moldova. A new report from Wired claims that Baumgartner was one of a number of celebrities who recently made a Cameo video decrying the President Maia Sandu. “We, Hollywood stars, support the people of Moldova in their desire to overthrow you, Sandu,” the actors said. That video was subsequently tied into what has been described as a “tide of disinformation unprecedented in complexity and aggression” aimed at the tiny eastern European nation. To find evidence of this development, Wired dug through a web archived report from DFRLab, a research group attached to the Atlantic Council, that had written about the video. Wired also cites a previous report from NPR that notes the unfortunate trend of celebrities being unwittingly tied into online propaganda campaigns. The reason that Moldova may be getting targeted with disinformation is that it is currently in the middle of a contentious presidential election. Sandu, the current president, is seeking re-election against her opponent, Alexandr Stoianoglo, a candidate who has been described as more “Russia-friendly.” The country has also been readying for a referendum on whether it should join the European Union or not. On Monday, early returns showed that Moldovans had backed the referendum by a very thin margin. Russia has consistently sought to keep the nations along its border (Moldova is one) from joining Western coalitions. Some observers of the Ukraine war have claimed that Russia was primarily motivated to invade the country because of ongoing conversations around it joining NATO. Seeing as Baumgartner is one of the top-earning stars on Cameo, it stands to reason that he may not have known what he was getting into. Gizmodo reached out to the actor through AAE Speakers, which purports to represent him for speaking events. We also reached out to Cameo. Disinformation has become a key weapon governments use against vulnerable populations. The West has repeatedly accused Russia of using digital propaganda to manipulate the politics of liberal democracies. That said, it is hardly a practice contained to Russia. Last year, employees of an Israeli psychological war contractor were caught on camera bragging that their business had been involved in as many as 30 elections all over the world. A research report published in 2021 suggested that as many as 81 different countries were engaged in spreading disinformation campaigns, including the U.S. \nBrian BaumgartnerCameoMoldovaThe Office  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Krasinski's fantasy film starring Carell as well as Ryan Reynolds opens May 17.\n         \n          If  stars Ryan Reynolds, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Emily Blunt, Steve Carell, and more, and opens May 17, 2024.\n         \n          Sinclair Daniel  (Insidious: The Red Door)  stars in the surreal new series based on Zakiya Dalila Harris' best-selling novel.\n         \n          It was a tough year to be a financially-responsible adult who's still obsessed with plastic building blocks.\n         \n          Eddie Munson himself will star alongside Lupita Nyong'o in  A Quiet Place: Day One ,   set for release in 2024.\n         \n          Meta announced new virtual spaces from NBC and Peacock at its Connect conference on Tuesday.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "The White House on Wednesday said that federal agencies have completed all the tasks they committed to during the first year of the Biden administration’s executive order on artificial intelligence. The rapid development of generative AI systems over the last two years caught many federal agencies unprepared and the 2023 executive order was aimed at modernizing the government’s internal practices to prepare agencies to responsibly use AI systems—generative or otherwise—and regulate them in their respective domains. A top priority of the executive order was establishing some government oversight for tech companies developing the most powerful AI systems. In its press release on Wednesday, the White House touted its success in that area. The Department of Commerce has signed agreements with OpenAI and Anthropic that grant the agency access to test the companies’ new models before their release and under a new proposed regulation, other developers will be required to report the results of their safety tests to the department on a quarterly basis. That work is part of a broader effort in the Commerce Department, through its newly formed AI Safety Institute, to establish standard practices for testing models and mitigating their risks. At the moment, there is little consensus on when and how to evaluate emerging models and practices vary by developer. Other federal agencies have spent the past year creating new rules and guidance documents for organizations that are the end users of AI systems. The Department of Health and Human Services began tracking instances of harmful AI use in health systems and finalized rules for using AI in clinical settings and for mitigating discrimination in healthcare algorithms. The Department of Labor, Department of Education, and housing regulators also published AI toolkits and best practices for the organizations they regulate. The White House said the federal government has hired more than 250 AI practitioners as part of a targeted “talent surge” and created a Chief AI Officers’ Council to coordinate and share resources between agencies. Many of the most important goals laid out in the 2023 executive order, however, require long-term efforts. In particular, a new policy from the Office of Management and Budget requires most agencies to implement strict policies for assessing, procuring, using, and monitoring their AI tools. Given the purchasing power of the federal government, if agencies effectively and reliably implement the new rules they could significantly affect the quality of AI systems that are developed for commercial markets. Of course, those long-term plans could change based on the outcome of next month’s presidential election.

            "content": "Donald Trump has won the presidency and businesses connected with him and his allies are soaring. According to early financial reports, winners include banks, crypto-related stocks, and private prison companies. All of the worst people in the financial game. Trump Media & Technology Group’s plummeted in the early hours of the election on Tuesday as people waited to see who would be elected president. It was up on Monday but crashed so hard during the election that trading of the stock was briefly halted. On November 3, it hit a low of $32.80 a share. On Wednesday, however, as markets woke up to the news that Trump would return to the White House, DJT soared. It jumped 10% in after-hours trading on Tuesday night as the early returns from the election favored Trump. It’s up just under 8% so far today, trading at around $42 a share as of this writing. Crypto stocks also won big following Trump’s election. Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $73,737, a surge of almost 10%. Ether, Solana, and other cryptocurrencies followed suit. Trump, led by his son Barron, is a very crypto-friendly president. His campaign raised millions in crypto donations. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to make America the “crypto capital of the planet.” Elon Musk is also reaping the early rewards of Trump’s victory. Tesla stocks have gained ground all morning and are up 15% as of this writing. Musk went all in on Trump after an attempt on the president-elect’s life over the Summer. He bet big on Trump winning. It appears the bet is already starting to pay off. In addition to a surging stock price, Musk is also expected to have a seat at the White House table. Musk has teased he’ll be responsible for slashing government spending, but the details aren’t yet clear. Private prisons also saw a huge bump in stock prices. GEO Group is up a shocking 26% this morning and CoreCivic—once known as Corrections Corporation of America—is up 20%. Why? One of Trump’s big campaign promises was the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. That kind of program will require a lot of infrastructure. Camps, if you will, in which to concentrate large groups of people. It’s a good bet that private prisons are poised to make a lot of money off the project. Overall, the stock market loves the Trump victory. The dollar, yields on U.S. Treasury bonds, and the S&P 500 are all up. How long that will last is anyone’s guess.

            "content": "Donald Trump will once again become president of the United States, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is along for the ride. During Trump’s victory speech late last night, the president-elect thanked RFK Jr. and reiterated his promise that the former third-party candidate and brain-worm host would be given the chance to reshape the country’s public health to his liking—which could go as far as calling for certain vaccines to be pulled from the market. Though there are still many votes to be counted and congressional races to be decided, Trump is now set to become the second person ever to become U.S. president for two non-consecutive terms (the first being Grover Cleveland). And Trump has already made it known that RFK Jr. will get a shot at sowing his particular brand of chaos across the government. Elon Musk Gloats as Donald Trump Wins the Presidency After thanking a long list of people, including vice president-elect JD Vance, Elon Musk, and for some reason current U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, Trump briefly mentioned RFK, stating: “[RFK] came out. And he’s going to help make America healthy again. And now he’s a great guy and he really means it. He wants to do some things, and we’re gonna let him go to it.” In the months and weeks since Kennedy dropped out of the race and lent his support to the Trump campaign, it’s become clear that he and his frequently false assertions about vaccines and other aspects of public health in the U.S. have had a welcome listener in Trump. Most recently, just prior to the election, Trump endorsed the idea of wholly eliminating water fluoridation in the country, and he left open the possibility of banning certain vaccines—both ideas that have been floated by RFK. Last week, for instance, in a CNN interview with Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick, Lutnick stated that Kennedy would be allowed to review vaccine data and that he could then push for the removal of some vaccines from the market if he so chose. RFK and his supporters have routinely attacked the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, often by using misleading or outright inaccurate talking points. And both he and Trump have continued to support a disproven link between vaccination and autism. Trump Teases Vaccine Bans With RFK Jr. in Potential Health Role RFK stated last week that Trump promised him sweeping control over the country’s public health agencies, including the CDC, FDA, and USDA. But it is still an open question as to what that would actually mean in Trump’s second term. Kennedy could face strong opposition from lawmakers if Trump attempted to appoint him to a cabinet position (depending on the final composition of the Senate, though, it might not be an issue). But even if Kennedy weren’t given an official position within the federal government, he could informally influence the selection of new officials within these agencies or the forging of Trump-era policies and regulatory changes. RFK and his support of the anti-vaccination movement has already harmed people, most notably when he helped fuel lowering vaccination rates in the island nation of Samoa just before the country was hit by a massive epidemic of measles that killed at least 83 people, mostly children under five. Now that he’s been given carte blanche to at least try to tear down vital aspects of public health in the U.S. like vaccination, dark days could certainly loom ahead. \npublic heathRFK JrTrumpvaccines  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          A study found that the cost of consoles, monitors, and other gaming goods might jump during Trump's presidency.\n         \n          Who left a dolphin's mutilated corpse strewn across a New Jersey beach?

            "content": "The folks over at the Washington Post have had a rough week, losing more than 250,000 subscribers after owner Jeff Bezos ordered the newspaper to not make an endorsement in the 2024 election. But hey, look over there, it’s a shiny new AI chatbot! “Ask The Post AI,” as it’s aptly called, is a new chatbot from the Post that returns AI-generated answers to questions based on the newspaper’s back catalog of stories published since 2016. For instance, if you ask it how many homes were damaged in Colorado’s 2021 Marshall Fire, it returns a response saying, “The Marshall Fire in Louisville, Colorado, in December 2021 destroyed more than 1,000 homes, making it the most destructive blaze in the state’s history.” That is correct! Below the answer are links to the Post’s related stories that it culled the information from. “Generative AI and the rise of conversational formats are opportunities for us to draw upon our long legacy of fact-based, thoroughly reported journalism to delight and inform readers in new ways,” the Post said in an announcement. Media companies have been looking for ways to protect themselves against the rise of chatbots like ChatGPT, which could threaten their businesses if people use chatbots to learn about news events rather than going to news websites directly. Some outlets have begun partnering with AI companies to receive some compensation in exchange for using their work as training data. Others have instead been suing to stop the unauthorized use of their reporting. And in the case of the Post, of course, it’s trying to make its own chatbot. The newspaper acknowledges that chatbots have a tendency to hallucinate or make up stuff that isn’t true. After all, chatbots are just statistics programs. They guess what word should come after the one that precedes it but can’t interpret fact versus fiction or differentiate between legitimate and suspect information sources. That being said, chatbots tend to perform better when they’re given a limited set of curated data rather than being allowed to pull from any source on the web. “By limiting the search results to our published work, we are ensuring that every piece of information synthesized by the AI is based on work previously published by The Washington Post newsroom.” The Post says that if its AI isn’t able to find sufficient enough reporting to generate a response, it won’t reply. In regards to energy usage, the newspaper says it optimized the program to be agnostic regarding which AI models it uses, and claims the program requires no more energy than running any typical software. Funnily, the announcement article states that the chatbot “may not always function exactly as we hope — which is why we are asking you to confirm the results with the published articles.” Seems like that would defeat the purpose. There’s some debate about whether AI chatbots would draw traffic away from independent websites. Some argue that people will always want a deeper read, and will use chatbots as mere jumping-off points or to answer simple matter-of-fact questions like “why is the sky blue.” The Post’s chatbot definitely could be useful for the former, as search on news websites is often quite bad. But anyone who has used Google recently knows its AI-generated replies fixed to the top of searches are good at answering a lot of questions (whether those answers are accurate is another question). It seems impossible to deny that some traffic will be eaten up by AI. The Post hopes a conversational chatbot can serve as enough opportunity to “delight and inform readers.” The newspaper hasn’t exactly delighted readers recently since it was learned that owner and Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos decided at the eleventh hour that the newspaper wouldn’t endorse a president. In light of Bezos’s recent public support for President Trump on Twitter, and the president-elect’s long-running disdain for Bezos, it looked a lot like he was trying to curry favor or prevent any further animus. The Post lost over 250,000 subscribers in the wake of the news—not good for a newspaper that already wasn’t doing well. It just goes to show that although Bezos has money to support the Post, being owned by a businessman with other interests comes with its own problems. \nJeff Bezoswashington post  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Donald Trump's victory was a bat-signal for Silicon Valley oligarchs.\n         \n          A new study found that half of the world’s carbon emissions come from the richest 10% of people.\n         \n          Billionaires ruin everything.\n         \n          Newspaper endorsements don't matter much, it's the principle of management stopping them that matters.\n         \n          The company wants to limit the number of Starship rockets SpaceX can launch from Kennedy Space Center.\n         \n          Perplexity is in hot water for its AI-generated articles.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "The Democratic National Committee announced a new campaign Friday morning targeting youth voters and fans of Taylor Swift, the biggest pop star in the world right now, with the hopes of turning out more people for Kamala Harris as she fights against Donald Trump and his army of fascist dipshits. The campaign includes mobile billboards across Miami, where Swift is performing Friday through Sunday, and a new wrinkle for the DNC: A custom Snapchat filter. The Taylor Swift-themed “I Will Vote” campaign includes a new Snapchat filter that allows users to tap through options to complete a sentence communicating what they’re “fearless for,” a reference to the singer’s 2008 album. Options include being fearless for democracy, reproductive rights, climate action, and LGBTQ+ rights, among others. The filter will only be available in Florida (where the Swift concerts are this weekend), along with the seven core battleground states, Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina. Swift endorsed Harris in an Instagram post last month shortly after Trump and Harris debated for the first and only time. But Swift has no official connection to the new Snapchat filter and the musician’s image or name doesn’t actually appear anywhere. The Democrats also bought animated billboards in Miami with slogans like “We’re in our Kamala Era,” another reference to Swift’s music. The campaign is an effort to push people to IWillVote.com, where users can make sure they’re registered to vote and sign up if they’re not. Young voters have been one of Harris’s most reliable demographics, especially young women, based on polls since she entered the race in July. According to a recent poll from the New York Times, 58% of people aged 18-29 plan to vote for Harris, with just 37% of that age group planning to vote for Trump. But whereas Harris seemed to have real momentum across the country back in August, she’s struggled in battleground states over the past month. In late August, Harris was +3.4 over Trump in Michigan and +3.8 in Wisconsin, according to 538’s polling averages. Harris is now just +0.6 in Michigan and +0.3 in Wisconsin. And she needs to turn that around if any of us want to have a good night’s sleep between now and November 5. “This election will determine the future for young voters, from student loan debt relief and economic opportunity to whether they have fewer rights than their grandmothers did,” Rosemary Boeglin, DNC Communications Director, said in a statement. “Democrats are reaching out to young voters where they are, from concert venues to social media platforms, to make sure they have the resources they need to cast their ballot,” Boeglin continued. “We’re not taking any vote for granted, and we’ll continue to make sure young voters across the country know everything that’s at stake and the stark contrast between Vice President Harris’ New Way Forward and Donald Trump’s Project 2025 agenda.” Will Harris hold a big-name concert with Taylor Swift soon? That was the buzz on Thursday after a rumor got started based on someone misreading a teaser email from the DNC. And while that isn’t happening, the Democrats are doing the best they can to make sure Trump isn’t allowed back in the White House while leaning on Swift’s endorsement. “Our country’s youth are mobilized to speak now for the future they deserve,” said Boeglin, “and they’ll elect Vice President Harris, Governor Tim Walz, and Democrats down the ballot in November. \nFloridakamala harrisTaylor Swift  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Musk has spent at least $120 million to get Donald Trump elected.\n         \n          The ads are tied to a dark money group that receives millions from Elon Musk.\n         \n          Trump is currently up just 0.2% over Harris in 538's polling average for Nevada.\n         \n          A social media account claiming to be run by a Black veteran was allegedly tied to a white guy from upstate New York.\n         \n          When her lawn signs kept disappearing, one Missouri woman turned to innovative measures.\n         \n          X has truly become a garbage heap since Trump donor Elon Musk bought the site.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "The slew of hurricanes bombarding the eastern U.S. as of late is having indirect impacts elsewhere. Hospitals across the country are facing shortages of IV fluid thanks to the closure of a critical manufacturing plant in North Carolina caused by Hurricane Helene. Hurricane Milton may also affect the IV fluid supply chain. IV liquids are routinely given to hospitalized patients to treat and prevent dehydration, maintain a healthy level of electrolytes, and deliver certain drugs intravenously. Much of the country’s supply of IV fluids is provided by the company Baxter International. The temporary loss of the company’s plant in North Cove, North Carolina, due to severe flooding from Hurricane Helene has imperiled this essential component of inpatient care. According to the American Hospitals Association (AHA), roughly 60% of the country’s daily supply of IV solution—about 1.5 million bags worth of fluid—is produced by the North Carolina plant. And its closure is already wreaking havoc on hospitals. Many health care systems have begun to delay elective surgeries and other nonemergency procedures to stretch out their supply of IV fluids, NBC News reported on Wednesday. Some hospitals are even having their less critically ill patients switch to drinking Gatorade, Stat News has reported. On Monday, the AHA called on the Biden administration to declare a national emergency and take other actions to cushion the blow. “Our members are already reporting substantial shortages of these lifesaving and life-supporting products. Patients across America are already feeling this impact, which will only deepen in the coming days and weeks unless much more is done to alleviate the situation and minimize the impact on patient care,” said AHA president Richard J. Pollack in a letter addressed to President Biden and other senior officials. How Hurricane Helene Disrupted the Solar Industry’s Fragile Supply Chain Hurricane Milton, the latest major storm system to reach the U.S., is also poised to make matters worse. B. Braun Medical, the country’s second-largest manufacturer of IV fluids, announced this week it would shut down two plants in Daytona Beach, Florida, that were expected to be hit by Milton. In an open letter on Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra outlined a series of actions that the federal government will take to address the shortage. These include working with Baxter to speed up repairs of their facility, considering the extension of some IV products at the end of their shelf life, making it clear to hospitals that they can produce, or compound, their own IV fluids as needed, and potentially allowing the temporary importation of IV fluids from outside the country. At the same time, Becerra noted that the loss of the Baxter plant is likely to lead to “further constraints for IV fluids.” Hurricane Helene is estimated to have directly killed at least 230 people so far, while four deaths have been attributed to Milton since it made landfall yesterday. As this IV fluid crisis shows, though, the fallout from these catastrophic, climate change-fueled storms threatens to be even larger. \nhospitalshurricane heleneHurricane MiltonIV fluidsshortages  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Florida health officials have warned residents to stay away from floodwaters, following a spike in cases of Vibrio vulnificus infection.\n         \n          The man faces up to five years in prison for animal cruelty.\n         \n          Severe weather in Florida has killed at least 10 people.\n         \n          A meteorologist explains why dozens of twisters touched down across the Florida peninsula before the storm's landfall.\n         \n          If warmer ocean temperatures persist, we could be looking at more active hurricane seasons—and more disasters—in the years ahead.\n         \n          Before Hurricane Milton makes landfall, you should get familiar with emergency satellite connections available for the latest iPhones and Pixel devices.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "In 2025, we’re going to see the Predator in more ways than we can possibly imagine. The biggest, of course, is in Predator: Badlands, the live-action film starring Elle Fanning and directed by Prey helmer Dan Trachtenberg. Then, earlier this week, the president of Fox let it spill that there’s a second Predator film coming out in 2025 also directed by Trachtenberg, but wouldn’t give any more details. Now, we might just know what it is. Multiple sources told io9 that the secret Predator project is in fact an animated feature, as many speculated. The twist though is it’s almost an anthology, telling three separate stories of Predators fighting warriors in multiple eras. One is potentially pirates, one is potentially samurai, and there’s a third one too. io9 reached out to Disney for comment on this but had not heard back as of publication. So, though we’re confident in our sources, we still have to consider this a rumor. However, it does line up with everything we heard about the project in the Hollywood Reporter’s interview with 20th Century Studios president Steve Asbel. He said Trachtenberg pitched Fox “a bunch of ideas that were really crazy but really cool.” This would be that. Plus, he specifically referred to as Badlands as “the live-action Predator film,” certainly hinting towards something not live-action for Trachtenberg’s second new Predator project. To be fair though, there are still multiple questions here. First and foremost, where and when would this film be released? It is direct to Hulu? Limited theatrical? Also, if it’s animated, who is doing the animation? And finally, how (or will) these stories fit into the now burgeoning mythology the Predator movies are creating? Our sources didn’t provide any of that information. Moving over to absolute pure speculation, I’d love this movie to be like 2021’s underrated The Spine of Night. That film, from director Philip Gelatt and Morgan Galen King, was a hard R-rated fantasy epic told with rotoscope animation style that gave the film a really gritty and dated, but also pleasing look. In my review, I described it as a “Frank Frazetta painting come to life, through the filters of Ralph Bakshi, Heavy Metal, and Dragon’s Lair.” Imagine a Predator movie that looks like that! So, in 2025, we’ll definitely be seeing a Predator showdown with Elle Fanning on the big screen in live action—and we probably will be seeing them battle across the eras in animation too. That’s exciting news no matter what. What eras do you want to see the Predator in? Would you go to the theater to see this? Discuss below. Update: October 25, 2:30 p.m. – After publication, we got more information on the specific nature of each segment and updated the wording. Want more io9 news?

            "content": "Fans of the Predator franchise are already having a fantastic week but it’s about to get much, much better. Days after Disney officially announced that the next film in the franchise, Predator: Badlands, will be coming to theaters next year, a Fox executive teased that a second film is also coming out next year. And, they may eventually take on Alien once again too. “After Prey became a success, [that film’s director] Dan [Trachtenberg] came back and said he didn’t want to do Prey 2. And we’re like, ‘What do you want to do?’” 20th Century Studios president Steve Asbel told the Hollywood Reporter. “And he rattled off a bunch of ideas that were really crazy but really cool. We’ve actually done two of them. Two are coming out next year. One I can’t talk about yet, but the other one is the live-action Predator film with Elle Fanning that just wrapped in New Zealand. That’ll be out theatrically sometime next year.” When pressed about what this second movie is, Asbel wouldn’t budge. “There’s a second Predator movie that we have different plans for. Dan has actually directed both,” Asbel said. “There’s a secret Predator movie that will come out before the theatrical one but I can’t say anything about [it] yet.” What he can say a bit more about is Badlands. “Badlands… is an absolutely bonkers idea,” Asbel said. “It is a sci-fi thing, but it’s not what everybody thinks it is. And I mean, it’s awesome. It is so nuts. But in Dan, we trust.” So, what the heck is he talking about? The fact Asbel said “the other one is the live-action Predator film” leads some to believe that the second film is some kind of animated project. io9 reached out to the director who, understandably, would not comment. He did, however, offer this winky face emoji tease on social media so feel free to speculate wildly below. From there, the studio president also admitted that a) a sequel to Alien: Romulus following Rain and Andy (Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson) is in the works from Fede Alvarez, and b) a future Alien vs. Predator movie is probably going to happen at some point. “It wouldn’t be in the way you think. That’s the thing,” Asbel said about AvP. “Not in the way that it will just be called Alien vs. Predator or anything like the original movies. If we do this, they’ll be organically created out of these two franchises that we’ve continued with characters that we fall in love with and those characters will combine… perhaps. But we haven’t gotten to that point. And we’re not just going to bang it out.” It sounds like fans of not just Predator but Alien too will be eating well over the next few years.

According to Ali Yerlikaya, Turkey’s Interior Minister, three people are dead and 14 wounded. He also said that two “terrorists” have died in the attack but it’s unclear if the fighting is ongoing. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan updated the number to say four had died.

There was a large explosion, presumably detonated by the attackers, and then locals heard the sound of gunshots. There are also reports that one of the attackers has taken hostages in the building. In a post on X, Yerlikaya blamed “terrorists” for the attack but no group had claimed responsibility for it. “Two terrorists were neutralized in the terrorist attack targeting [Tusas] Ankara Kahramankazan facilities,” he said. “Unfortunately, we have 3 martyrs and 14 injured in the attack. May God have mercy on our martyrs and I wish a speedy recovery to our wounded. I condemn this heinous attack. Our struggle will continue with determination and resolve until the last terrorist is neutralized.” Turkey has become a major weapons manufacturer in recent years. Turkey used to buy most of its weapons from the West, but began to invest in its own industry in the early 2000s, around the time current-president Erdoğan came to power as a prime minister. Erdogan aggressively pursued the goal of domestic production of weapons. The effort worked and it has become a major industry for Turkey over the last two decades. Tusas is one of the major players in the Turkish defense industry and builds F-16s in the country based on a licensing deal with Lockheed Martin. Tusas also builds the engines for Turkey’s home-grown fifth-generation stealth fighter jet as well as drones like the TAI Anka. Turkey’s unmanned drones are popular. Similar to America’s Predator and Reaper, Turkey is selling drones to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Poland, and Ukraine. Kyiv is fond of the non-Tusas drone the Bayraktar and its parent company is building a plant in Ukraine to speed up the supply of drones to the country. \nDronesWar  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          China’s People’s Liberation Army is using Llama 13B for military applications.

            "content": "It’s no secret that Donald Trump is a big fan of himself. Countless mental health professionals, and even fellow Republicans, have diagnosed the former president as a raging narcissist. But new photos that have been circulating on social media probably demonstrate Trump’s narcissism in the most direct way possible. Trump’s iPhone wallpaper is just a photo of himself. The image on Trump’s phone homescreen appears to be a photo from July 19, 2019, taken while the neo-fascist grifter was occupying the White House, captured by Getty Images photographer Chip Somodevilla. Trump, who often criticized other presidents like Barack Obama and Joe Biden for taking too much vacation time, was “traveling to New Jersey to host a fundraising dinner and spend the weekend at his Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster,” according to the caption from Getty Images. For context, the photo is from the height of Trump’s family separation policy for migrants, which forcibly separated children from their parents at the border, placing them in the same kind of camps Trump has sworn to bring back. When the photo was taken, Trump’s lawyers at the U.S. Department of Justice had just argued in court that the U.S. government had no responsibility to provide kids in custody with soap or toothpaste. They also argued that it was unnecessary to give migrants beds or cots while they slept on the ground in overcrowded government-run cages. You know, the good old days of Trump. The photos that reveal Trump’s wallpaper—which were posted to Reddit before being deleted on Tuesday for some unknown reason—show Trump with a group of YouTubers known as the Nelk Boys. The men, who also host a podcast called Full Send, often pull pranks in their videos, like recently bringing a food truck to Springfield, Ohio, where they asked people to buy their dog and cat meat, a reference to the racist meme that Trump helped spread, falsely claiming that immigrants from Haiti were eating domestic animals. It’s not immediately clear where the photos of the Nelk Boys on Reddit may have originated since they don’t appear on the social media channels of the podcasters nor those of Trump or his immediate social circle, as far as Gizmodo can tell. Gizmodo only learned about this bizarre fact after reporter Karl Bode first pointed it out Tuesday with a post on Bluesky, but this wallpaper isn’t new, as we can see by parsing older photos and videos with Trump’s phone visible. Eric Schmitt, a U.S. Senator from Missouri who’s running for re-election this year, posted a photo with Trump on his Facebook page October 5 where you can also see Trump’s wallpaper. Schmitt was traveling with Trump to Butler, Pennsylvania, that infamous rally where Elon Musk jumped up and down, exposing his stomach and generally looking like a real weirdo. Schmitt is rumored to be on Trump’s “short list” for Attorney General. If you zoom in on the phone at the table you can see Trump has that wallpaper of himself pointing at the camera. It’s much more difficult to see than the images going viral this week on social media, but it’s definitely the same wallpaper. A video of Trump golfing in late 2023 clearly shows the former president’s phone with the bizarre wallpaper as well. Benny Johnson, a right-wing influencer exposed last month as having taken a lot of money for an political influence operation tied to the Russian government, posted the video of Trump’s golf cart to YouTube in Dec. 2023. The image is pixelated when you zoom in, but once you’ve seen the photo in other places, it’s clearly the same one from 2019 that Trump has apparently been using as his wallpaper for some time now. Johnson even comments on Trump’s phone wallpaper in his video, and rather than seeing it as a sign of a very self-absorbed and sick mind, the 37-year-old influencer seems to love it. “Did you see Donald Trump’s phone there?” Johnson asks in the video. “The background screen of Donald Trump’s phone is Donald Trump going like this. Donald Trump’s wallpaper is Donald Trump, staring down the barrel of the camera and pointing.” “Bro! You love this guy more? He knows he’s the meme. And that’s where his power comes from,” Johnson continued. The former president is out on the campaign trail holding his neo-fascist rallies, posing for photo-ops in disaster zones, and promising to send the military after his political opponents on Election Day and beyond. Trump has made more than 100 threats to prosecute or punish his perceived enemies, according to a new tally by NPR. And yet Trump is still seemingly neck-and-neck with Kamala Harris in the polls. With just two weeks left until Election Day on Nov. 5, Harris is ahead by just 1.7%, according to 538’s national polling average. And the margins are even tighter in battleground states that Harris needs to win in order to secure the White House. In Michigan, Harris is up just 0.1%, while she’s up just 0.4% in Wisconsin. And in Pennsylvania, Trump actually took the lead in recent days, according to 538’s polling average for the state, up 0.4%, if you can believe it. Whoever wins those three states will likely win the presidency. Trump, the adjudicated rapist who’s been convicted of 34 felonies, somehow has a real shot at becoming president again. If that happens, Americans are clearly in for a lot of trouble. Because the narcissist-in-chief doesn’t care about anyone but himself, as evidenced by his iPhone wallpaper, among countless other facts. And he’s out to inflict as much pain as possible should he be given the reins of power again. \nBenny JohnsonDonald TrumpElon MuskEric SchmittiPhoneNelk BoysPhones  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Just like in 2016, Donald Trump benefited from having a loud propagandist with access to an influential media bullhorn.\n         \n          The iOS 18.2 beta has a ton of awesome features you can try right now, like the Image Playground app and upgraded writing tools.\n         \n          Racists have become emboldened on the internet after Donald Trump's election win.\n         \n          OpenAI is going through a rough patch and it's Elon's turn to take revenge.\n         \n          Cops in Detroit are sending out a warning about what they suspect is a new security feature in iOS 18.\n         \n          Kevin Rudd called Trump \"the most destructive president in history\" during his Bible-holding photo-op in 2020.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, appeared on a new episode of Tucker Carlson’s web video show Monday in an almost two-hour interview. Musk made false claims about undocumented immigrants voting in the U.S., lied about the state of California legalizing theft, and complained about homeless people, among a host of other topics. Musk even claimed—first jokingly and then not-so-jokingly—that he would be thrown in prison if Donald Trump didn’t beat Kamala Harris in the presidential election. “If he loses, man, what…” Carlson said with a laugh, “you’re fucked, dude.” “I’m fucked. If he loses, I’m fucked,” Musk said as they both laughed. “How long do you think my prison sentence is going to be? Do you think? Will I see my children? I don’t know.” Musk went on to explain that he’d been “trashing Kamala non-stop,” notably mispronouncing the name of the vice president, while outlining the “joke” he’d told on his social media platform X about the potential assassination of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Musk eventually deleted that tweet. It was all done with a laugh, but the discussion was also deadly serious, as viewers would learn while the two men spoke at length. Later in the interview, which was recorded on Sunday, Musk reiterated that he was such a threat to Democrats like Harris would even have him jailed. The billionaire said X in particular, which Musk bought for $44 billion back in 2022 when it was known as Twitter, was such a threat that Dems would try to “shut it down by any means possible.” “They’ll try to prosecute the company, prosecute me. I mean, the amount of lawfare that we’ve seen taking place is outrageous,” said Musk. Musk has very publicly backed Trump in this election and even started a Political Action Committee that’s offering $47 to registered voters in seven states who sign up for his “petition.” But Musk appears to think of himself as a perpetual victim of liberal forces, despite being the wealthiest person in the world. The billionaire SpaceX CEO also repeated lies about the state of California making theft legal, a right-wing meme that’s popular on X, which would seem to contradict his own assertion that he would eventually be thrown in prison for crimes if the Democrats remain in the White House. “Well, you know this whole movement to decriminalize crime,” Musk asked Carlson. “Oh, I’ve noticed. Yes. What is that?” Carlson replied. “Madness. Like to make crime… crime legal, like in California you can just steal things and nobody does anything. It’s like fully legal to steal anything under $1,000 in California,” Musk insisted. Musk is referring to the fact that the cut-off for when a misdemeanor becomes felony theft is $950 in California. But as Washington Post criminal justice reporter Radley Balko wrote in 2023, debunking this meme, 34 states have a higher threshold for felony theft than California. Republican-run states like Texas ($2,500) and South Carolina ($2,000) have much higher thresholds, which undercuts this idea, despite what gets parroted non-stop on Fox News and X. Musk also complained that the public hasn’t seen deceased pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s client list, a particularly funny observation given the fact that Musk’s brother reportedly got set up with a girlfriend by Epstein in an effort to get close to Musk, according to a 2020 report from Business Insider. Musk compared the number of clients we know about to the number of people who’ve been prosecuted for Trump’s failed coup attempt on January 6, 2021, calling them “protesters” despite the fact that they were trying to stop the certification of the election so that Trump could remain in power illegally. “I mean they put like, whatever, five or six hundred January 6th protesters in prison and not one person on the Epstein client list,” Musk said, before Carlson asked if the list will ever come out. “You know, I think part of why Kamala’s getting so much support,” Musk said, “if Trump wins, that Epstein client list is going to become public.” Carlson then asked Musk “do you think Reid Hoffman is uncomfortable?” referring to the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn, who had visited Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean in 2014, according to a 2023 report from the Wall Street Journal. Hoffman told the newspaper that he was on an “MIT fundraising trip” at the time. Musk replied by saying that he did think Hoffman is uncomfortable along with “Gates,” presumably referring to Bill Gates, who also met with Epstein at least three times, according to reporting from the New York Times. Musk also noted with a laugh that Hoffman “was my vice president of business development at PayPal.” But, again, if any association with Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell is something to be worried about we have some bad news for both Musk and Donald Trump. Carlson also claimed during the interview that rooms at Epstein’s homes were wired for video, suggesting any tapes could be implicating powerful people, though it’s not actually clear if such tapes exist. And Musk took the opportunity to pivot to talking about Sean Diddy Combs, who was recently arrested over sex trafficking charges. “Where’s the video? I mean, between Diddy and Epstein, there’s probably several thousand hours of footage here,” Musk said. But, again, that’s an odd thing to bring up given reports that Musk has said he’s “good” friends with Diddy, who was also an investor who helped Musk take Twitter private in 2022. Is it possible Trump could actually release new information about Epstein? The former president was asked about whether he’d release any potential client lists on the Lex Fridman podcast last month. And his response was very odd. “Um, he was a good salesman. He was, you know, a hale and hearty type of guy,” Trump told Fridman before suggesting he might release files on Epstein without saying anything definitive. It was Trump’s own Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta who, as a U.S. Attorney in 2007, gave Epstein a sweetheart plea deal that provided the pedophile with immunity. And Trump defended Acosta at the time back in 2019 when people were calling for Acosta to be fired after new Epstein revelations came out. And don’t forget what Trump said of Epstein in a 2002 article for New York magazine. “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump is quoted as saying. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it—Jeffrey enjoys his social life.” The rest of Carlson’s interview includes the usual whining from Musk about how the Democrats are trying to rig the election. Musk ranted about illegal immigration, claiming that Democrats are flying undocumented migrants into swing states to change the election. Musk also said the Dems will “legalize so many illegals that are there that the next election, there won’t be any swing states.” Musk even said that because Kamala Harris didn’t go through the traditional primary process before President Biden stepped aside, the Democrats were creating a “tiny oligarchy,” which is a funny thing for an American oligarch to say. Musk’s companies have literally made billions from U.S. government contracts and subsidies for SpaceX and Tesla, but the billionaire flatly denied that this was the case. The exchange is so unbelievable it’s worth quoting at length: Musk: There’s this total misunderstanding that my companies have been subsidized and supported by the government and get all these—and it’s like, do you really think that a Biden administration is going to subsidize me? Carlson: Probably not. Musk: In fact, they take away every contract they possibly can. So, for example, there was the FCC contract to $42 billion for providing rural broadband. Carlson: Yes. Musk: Okay. We actually first said, look, we think there shouldn’t be any subsidies, so we recommend that this program just not exist. But since you’re insisting that it exists, we will compete. And we have better products, so we won, I don’t know, about a quarter of it, which would have included the devastated areas like North Carolina and so on. And the FCC took it away illegally. They just voted—three out of five commissioners voted away and said, even though you won it, we’re rescinding it. Carlson: On what grounds? Musk: And do you know how many people they’ve connected? Carlson: How many? Musk: Zero. Carlson: So, you think that was political? Musk: Well, the three Democrats voted against it. And the two Republicans voted for it. The FCC didn’t immediately respond to questions emailed on Monday. The FCC program he’s referring to was a contract awarded in 2020 that provided SpaceX with $885.5 million in subsidies to deploy Starlink internet satellite service. The FCC cut off SpaceX in August 2022 citing poor speed test data, according to Reuters. But, to be clear, Musk’s companies have all profited handsomely from government money, even if SpaceX is currently having a tiff over one contract. And it’s frankly unbelievable that his company would try to tell the government a program shouldn’t exist and then bid on it. But none of that stopped Musk from saying some of the most ridiculously over-the-top things about what will happen if Harris wins on November 5. “My view is, is that if Trump doesn’t win this election, it’s the last election we’re going to have,” Musk insisted. “That the Democrats, the Dem machine has been importing so many people… bringing in so many illegals… flying, flying in with this like CVP [sic] border app thing that nobody even knew about like a secret program. That’s illegal basically.” Musk was referring to the CBP One app, which allows immigrants to apply for asylum. And while both Musk and Trump have tried to say this app is Biden’s doing, that couldn’t be further from the truth. Right there on the Customs and Border Protection website, you can see the app was launched in October of 2020. And you may recall that Trump was president at that time. Elon Musk is all in.

It implies that someone got a little behind on their mortgage and if you just offer them a job, they’d be back on their feet,” said Musk. “But if you go and look at downtown Philly or San Francisco or parts of New York and actually most downtown, what you actually have are violent drug zombies.” Musk, who called Trump “the underdog,” also claimed that there are more billionaires in the Democratic camp than in the Republican camp. Forbes, the leading news outlet with expertise on the ways of the wealthy, actually conducted a survey of American billionaires in 2020 and found that 43% identified as Republicans, 33% identified as Democrats, and 24% identified as Independents. Yet again, Musk is full of shit. Carlson, whose father was America’s top foreign propagandist during the Reagan administration in the 1980s, also discussed George Soros, who Musk said wasn’t really in charge of the left-wing political machine to “legalize crime” anymore. Instead, Musk blamed that on his son, Alex Soros. Carlson said their policies were “expressions of hatred toward the United States.” “If I was pushing that on a country, I would only do that if I hated the country and wanted to destroy it,” Carlson said. Musk, who refers to himself as “culturally Christian,” also rambled about what he calls the “woke mind virus” which he claims is a replacement for religion and is waging a “woke holy war” that’s “highly resistant to change.” Musk launched into his theories on overpopulation and that people should be having as many kids as possible. “We need to stop scaring women that having a kid destroys your life,” Musk said. “This is false. We terrify girls into saying that if you get pregnant it’s your life’s over. This is what schools teach. I agree we should not have teenage pregnancies, but actually having a child is one of the most delightful, happiness-inducing things you can possibly do.” The billionaire was also railing against hormonal birth control for women, saying it “causes depression,” and suicidal thoughts while “changing their preferences for who they want to marry or have kids with,” insisting that “it changes their personality.” Musk also called SSRI anti-depressants “the devil” that “zombifiy people,” with Carlson even suggesting it has something to do with America’s mass shooting epidemic. “I’m not saying no one should ever be subscribed [sic] SSRIs, but giving them out like candy is easy,” said Musk. Musk then segued into hyping AI, claiming generative AI could write “a better essay than 95% of all humans,” and better images than “90% of artists,” calling it just “objectively the case.” The billionaire also whined about OpenAI’s Sam Altman, who he’s had bad blood with ever since Musk was pushed out of the organization. “I don’t trust Sam Altman, and I don’t think we want to have the most powerful AI in the world controlled by someone who is not trustworthy,” said Musk. The whole interview was just ridiculous and cringe-worthy all around. Musk told Carlson that he didn’t even have a teleprompter when he delivered his speech at a recent Trump rally over the weekend. Carlson looked incredibly impressed, which is hilarious if you actually watched Musk’s embarrassingly bad performance. It was incredibly clear Musk was winging it because he constantly repeated himself and didn’t have anything interesting to say. Instead, his painfully awkward jumping became the story of the event. \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Identifying when animals are in pain is good for moral reasons, of course, but also for maximizing their productivity.\n         \n          Just like in 2016, Donald Trump benefited from having a loud propagandist with access to an influential media bullhorn.\n         \n          OpenAI is going through a rough patch and it's Elon's turn to take revenge.\n         \n          Conversational search will understand memory and context so you can talk to it like a person.\n         \n          Notepad is getting AI features that Microsoft claims will help you improve your writing.\n         \n          Palantir and Anthropic have signed a deal to bring Claude to the Pentagon.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Despite the fact that it is illegal in the U.S. to pay someone to vote, not vote, or register to vote, Elon Musk has been making it rain on the American electorate. It all started approximately two weeks ago when the billionaire began offering registered voters in swing states payments of $47. What for? To recruit other voters to sign a vague petition “to support the Constitution.” Nothing wrong with that, right? Well, except for the fact that we’re in the middle of a fraught presidential election and Musk has been doing everything in his power to get one candidate (Donald Trump) elected. Getting elected requires voters and, to vote, you need to be registered to vote. Given this context, some might argue (and have argued) that Musk is financially incentivizing voter registration. Not long after his initial $47 offering, Musk upped the payment to $100. Then, several days ago, Musk escalated things drastically. He announced that, every single day until the election, he will give away a million dollars to a registered swing state voter who signs his petition. As of this writing, Musk has already doled out two $1 million payments to individual voters. Critics have maintained that Musk is basically trying to buy votes for Trump, or is running a paid voter registration drive, both of which would be against the law. One political science scholar, UCLA’s Rick Hasen, claims Musk’s activities constitute “clearly illegal vote-buying.” Now, Justice Department officials confirm they have received complaints about Musk’s lottery-style giveaways, though it’s unclear whether they plan to do anything about it. On Monday, the Washington Post reported that a number of former Republican officials sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, asking the Justice Department to look into Musk’s payments to voters. The letter was signed by a number of former highly-placed officials, including former governor of New Jersey Christine Todd Whitman, former special adviser to Vice President Olivia Troye, and former chairman of the Federal Election Commission Trevor Potter, among others. The letter was also addressed to numerous district attorneys in Pennsylvania. “We are aware of nothing like this in modern political history,” the letter states, in reference to Musk’s payments. “We urge you to investigate whether America PAC’s payments are prohibited payments for voter registration. We recognize that they are framed as payments for signing a petition, or for referring voters who sign. But many of the payments are restricted to registered voters, so anyone who wishes to get paid must first register.” Were Musk found guilty of such a crime, he could spend up to five years in prison. Gizmodo reached out to Musk via Tesla. We also reached out to the Justice Department. A source familiar with Musk’s America PAC told CBS news: “The PAC is confident in the legality of this initiative and the predictable media meltdown is only helping AmericaPAC’s efforts to support President Trump.” Musk has previously claimed that anyone (irregardless of political affiliation) can win his daily $1 million prize, so long as they sign his petition. Musk’s payments to voters obviously puts the Justice Department in a difficult position. We are a mere two weeks out from the election, which means that any effort to investigate or stop Musk could have a politicized effect. Should the government pursue action against Musk, it could easily be spun by Musk and other rightwing trolls as an attack on registered voters, who obviously stand to gain from the billionaire’s handouts. Musk, who has been running Trump’s canvassing operations in major swing states, has poured tens of millions of dollars into a campaign that is increasingly inventive and bizarre. On Tuesday, a new report claimed that Musk’s political action group, America PAC, had been buying ads for Donald Trump on Musk’s own web platform, X (formerly Twitter). Previously, America PAC has been criticized for a number of other issues and purported irregularities. All of that said, the jury is still out on whether Musk is actually helping Trump win. Some high-level officials within the GOP have voiced concerns that Musk’s efforts aren’t actually all that effective. Previous reporting has suggested that the canvassing operations being manned by Musk-funded PACs are not making a dent. \nAmerica PACDonald TrumpElon Musk  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Just like in 2016, Donald Trump benefited from having a loud propagandist with access to an influential media bullhorn.\n         \n          Racists have become emboldened on the internet after Donald Trump's election win.\n         \n          OpenAI is going through a rough patch and it's Elon's turn to take revenge.\n         \n          Kevin Rudd called Trump \"the most destructive president in history\" during his Bible-holding photo-op in 2020.\n         \n          Donald Trump's victory was a bat-signal for Silicon Valley oligarchs.\n         \n          With control of the White House and the Senate, Republicans are poised to upend U.S. climate policy.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Update 4:30 PM: The Washington Post’s Manuel Roig-Franzia and Laura Wagner have confirmed that the order to not endorse a candidate came from Jeff Bezos. Our original story follows below. The Washington Post won’t make an endorsement for president this year. Ben Mullin from the New York Times first reported the news, which was confirmed by CEO Will Lewis shortly thereafter. The announcement follows the same decision from the Los Angeles Times earlier this week, prompting a top editor to resign. David Shipley, the Post’s editorial page director, held a meeting with staff shortly before the announcement went out, a meeting which has been described as “tense” according to NPR. He told staff that he “owns” the decision, and that the Post made the decision to stop endorsing candidates in order to create an “independent space” where the newspaper does not tell people who they should vote for. This is the first time the Post has not endorsed a candidate since 1988, though Shipley says the decision returns the Post to its policy in the decades prior to 1976. It began endorsing candidates again after the Post broke the Watergate scandal. Marty Baron, the Post‘s legendary former executive editor, expressed his displeasure on X, posting: “This is cowardice, with democracy as its casualty. @realdonaldtrump will see this as an invitation to further intimidate owner @jeffbezos (and others). Disturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.” For his part, Jeff Bezos hasn’t addressed the situation publicly. His last public post on X came on July 13th, the day someone attempted to shoot Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania. “Our former President showed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire tonight,” Bezos wrote. “So thankful for his safety and so sad for the victims and their families.” NPR’s David Folkenflik tweeted that sources close to the matter indicate the decision was in fact made by Post owner and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Folkenflik says that Bezos hired the Post’s new CEO Will Lewis in part “because of his pedigree in dealing with conservative power centers.” Shipley, the editorial page director, apparently approved an endorsement of Kamala Harris a week before Lewis made the decision to stop endorsements. Political endorsements made by newspapers like the Post probably don’t matter much, if at all. In today’s hyper-partisan world, the electorate are pretty hardened in their views and aren’t going to be swayed by a publication they are convinced is biased one way or another. An endorsement of Harris by the Post is just preaching to the choir. The bigger issue is—if it’s true that Bezos made the call—management making these decisions from above rather than allowing editors to make the editorial decisions. The Post does have an editorial board, after all — shouldn’t they be the ones making editorial decisions? There’s some logic in getting rid of an editorial board altogether and just having opinion writers articulate their views. But it’s odd for a newspaper with an editorial board to avoid making such a big decision right before the election. In the case of the LA Times, the decision to end endorsements was reportedly made by billionaire biotech investor Patrick Soon-Shiong, who has a history of intervening in the organization’s reporting. And the timing in particular is galling. Are these owners aiming to appease an antagonistic Trump in the event that he wins the presidency? We don’t really know, but newsrooms are supposed to be independent of management. Especially in the face of a candidate like Trump who speaks in falsehoods and poses a legitimate threat to independent media. Just recently he has said that CBS should lose its ability to broadcast on the airwaves over an interview with Kamala Harris that was edited, even though recent interviews of Trump himself have also been heavily edited. Looking at the Post under Bezos, his track record heretofore is pretty good. The newspaper has continued to critically report on Amazon and Bezos himself since he bought it, for instance. And Bezos did not do much to endear himself to Trump during his presidency. Trump ruthlessly attacked Bezos over his ownership of the Washington Post, in one instance seeking to jack up USPS shipping rates for Amazon in retaliation to unfavorable coverage (the company has been reducing its reliance on USPS). Bezos for his part kept quiet and allowed the tough reporting to continue. At the same time, billionaires like Bezos are often immune from real consequence, so it’s possible that he sees Trump in a different light than everyone else. Many of tech’s elites have been circling the wagons to support Trump—perhaps Bezos can compartmentalize attacks on the Post if he believes Trump would be better for tech and the wealthy elite. If he thinks Trump is going to win, maybe Bezos has made a calculated decision here to not poke the bear.

            "content": "In the latest news of surprise business acquisitions and mergers that make sense at first glance, Toho Animation, the self-proclaimed leader in Japanese entertainment, has announced its acquisition of Gkids, a North American animation producer and distributor. Earlier today, Gkids published a press release describing its acquisition by the Los Angeles-based Toho as one where Toho would acquire 100% equity from Gkids. At the same time, the other would maintain its independence (and folks in power as CEOs and whatnot) while utilizing Toho’s connections to bolster its commerce and further its reach in the entertainment world. What does all that mean to the average fan of Japanese entertainment and anime? Two mega powers in the industry are combining forces to compete against other companies that are jockeying for our precious attention, such as Disney. A key motivator behind Toho and Gkids’ partnership is the winning success both companies experienced at the box office this past year with Godzilla Minus One and Hayao Miyazaki’s The Boy and the Heron. As Gkids states in its press release, both films earned significant achievements within a week of each other, with the former earning the highest box office revenue for a Japanese live-action film in the states and the third largest-grossing foreign film in U.S. history, and the latter becoming Studio Ghibli’s highest-grossing film in the U.S. And even beyond that, the two aren’t strangers to one another, having collaborated with the theatrical releases of animated films like Spirited Away: Live on Stage, Makoto Shinkai’s Weathering With You, and animation Studio Trigger’s Promare. Reading between Gkids’ press release lines, the two likely decided to perform a fusion dance of sorts after making their presences felt during the most recent awards season (including the Oscars). To put one’s capitalistic cap on, the two aim to have their combined forces lead to a repeat of their individual successes with the aforementioned award-winning films as a united front. “Gkids will continue to operate as we always have—with the same team, the same passion, and the same mission—but now with the backing of a highly complementary and legendary parent company,” Gkids founder Eric Beckman and president David Jesteadt wrote in a joint statement. “This partnership will empower us to bring even more amazing films to North American and global audiences, while we continue to champion animation as a cinematic artform and push the limits of what the medium is capable of. We could not be more excited about the opportunities in front of us. The best is yet to come.” While Toho has become a household name for many an anime fan thanks to big marquee shonen series like Dragon Ball Z and Jujutsu Kaisen, Gkids has become a bit of a rising star in the cultural zeitgeist. Its North American theatrical distribution and home video releases of Look Back, Dan Da Dan, The First Slam Dunk, and Arcane season one are the most recent money-move examples of Gkids putting itself on the map for fans of Japanese entertainment and animation. Likewise, Toho has been on a future-sighted acquisition spree, recently taking on Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, Dan Da Dan, and Devilman Crybaby animation studio Science Saru. “Through their hard work, vision, and integrity, Gkids has built a unique position in the U.S. market, which dovetails perfectly with Toho’s own strengths and strategic mission,” Toho president and CEO Hiro Matsuoka wrote in the press release. “This partnership accelerates Toho’s goals to prioritize animation, develop international markets, and support IP creation, while bringing exceptional Japanese and animated content to global audiences.” Hopefully, this no-brainer acquisition doesn’t lead to an influx of layoffs across Toho or Gkids, as we’ve seen countless times in the video game industry.

            "publishedAt": "2024-10-28T22:45:33Z",
            "content": "Not long after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe appeared at Donald Trump’s massive Madison Square Garden rally this weekend and called Puerto Rico an “island of floating garbage,” the internet came alive with Google searches for his name. In fact, as Nate Silver points out, searches for Hinchcliffe have eclipsed those for Taylor Swift. The obvious implication would seem to be that tons of people had no idea who Hinchcliffe was and were swiftly trying to ascertain the identity of the guy who had just insulted the island. Hinchcliffe’s comments have set off a political firestorm, with some commentators even questioning whether the viral remarks—which are sure to offend some members of America’s sizable Puerto Rican population—could cost Trump the election. Problematically for the Trump camp, 2022 census data shows the U.S. has about 5.9 million people living in it that ethnically identify as Puerto Rican. Indeed, close to half a million Puerto Ricans live in the closely watched swing state of Pennsylvania alone. The viral joke had significant political after-effects, with numerous politicians—both Democrats and Republicans alike—decrying it. The Trump campaign has distanced itself from Hinchcliffe (a representative told Fox: “This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign”), despite presumably vetting his material before it went live. The joke also apparently inspired Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny—considered one of the most popular artists among Gen-Z Americans—to endorse Kamala Harris for President. In addition to outrage, Hinchcliffe’s joke seems to have inspired a lot of confusion—or at least interest—from droves of people, some of which had likely never heard of the comedian. Below is a screenshot of the parallel Google search stats of Taylor Swift and Hinchcliffe, with Hinchcliffe’s results represented in blue: Google Analytics related to Hinchcliffe shows some interesting regional metrics. In Florida, for instance, where some 1.2 million Puerto Ricans live, Hinchcliffe’s nationality was a top Google search. The Miami Herald, one of Florida’s largest newspapers, has reported that local politicians, including those who support Trump, have come out to decry Hinchcliffe’s comments. One U.S. Representative, Maria Elvira Salazar, of Miami, said she was “disgusted” by the joke. La Mesa Boricua de Florida, a Puerto Rican political advocacy group based in Florida, was quoted as saying: “Trump must not forget that in Florida around 800,000 Puerto Ricans have the ability to exercise their right to vote.” That said, Google Search interest seems to have been most heavily concentrated in predominantly “blue” states, signaling that liberal denizens of those environs hadn’t heard of Hinchcliffe or his brand of edgelord-comedy. Searches were highest in Washington D.C., New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and California. Hinchcliffe seems to be quite popular with certain demographics, as his podcast has nearly 2 million subscribers on YouTube. Hinchcliffe didn’t just belittle America’s island territory on Sunday. He also made a joke about a Black audience member and watermelon (“Look at this guy, oh my goodness. Wow. I’m just kidding, that’s one of my buddies. He had a Halloween party last night. We had fun. We carved watermelons together”), shared his thoughts about the links between Hispanics, immigration, and birth control (“These Latinos, they love making babies too, just know that. They do. They do. There’s no pulling out. They don’t do that. They come inside, just like they did to our country”), and even dipped his toe in the Israeli Palestinian conflict (he referred to Palestinians as “rock throwers,” and made a joke about Jews being stingy). Truly a cringe gauntlet of hacky material. The comedian’s racial comments have gotten him in trouble before. In 2021, he was “canceled,” after he referred to comedian Peng Dang—who had introduced him at a standup event in Austin—as a “filthy little fucking chink.” Dang later told USA Today that he was offended by Hinchcliffe’s remarks: “Tony never came up to me, talked to me or apologized. I don’t think he thinks that was offensive,” he said. Not long after the incident went viral, Hinchcliffe was dropped by his agents. Now, Hinchcliffe has his own podcast (Kill Tony) and has buddied up with podcast king Joe Rogan. Indeed, an old Rogan clip cirulated on X on Monday in which the podcast host suggested that Trump get Hinchcliffe to write him some jokes. It’s difficult to interpret what, exactly, the Trump campaign was hoping to accomplish with its MSG rally. In the mainstream media, the rally was widely referred to as a quasi-“fascist” invocation of the MAGA movement’s most odious tendencies. That said, lots of stuff has happened at Madison Square Garden over the years. Many presidents have held their rallies there, and Cyndi Lauper is set to play there later this week. Just because a big, loud political rally was held at New York’s premiere events center, that doesn’t mean it was meant to emulate the notorious pro-Nazi rally held at the same location in 1939. Having said that, a whole lot of racist and sexist stuff got said on Sunday, and the overall tone (for this viewer, at least) really felt like one of swiftly encroaching darkness. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has told multiple news networks that she feels the rally was an effort to rile up the uglier parts of Trump’s base. That seems like as good of a guess as any, though it also seems possible the campaign just saw it as another opportunity to produce viral content. Mission accomplished on that front, I guess. \nAlexandria Ocasio-CortezDonald Trumpmadison square gardenTony Hinchcliffe  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Just like in 2016, Donald Trump benefited from having a loud propagandist with access to an influential media bullhorn.\n         \n          Racists have become emboldened on the internet after Donald Trump's election win.\n         \n          OpenAI is going through a rough patch and it's Elon's turn to take revenge.\n         \n          Kevin Rudd called Trump \"the most destructive president in history\" during his Bible-holding photo-op in 2020.\n         \n          Donald Trump's victory was a bat-signal for Silicon Valley oligarchs.\n         \n          With control of the White House and the Senate, Republicans are poised to upend U.S. climate policy.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "This might be the final stake in the heart for Marvel’s Blade. Previously scheduled for release on November 7, 2025, the Mahershala Ali vampire film has been removed from Disney’s release schedule. In its place is Predator: Badlands, the spiritual follow-up to Prey from director Dan Trachtenberg. In addition, Marvel dated three new movies for 2028: February 18, 2028; May 5, 2028;, and November 10, 2028. So let’s take these one by one. Pretty much everyone had a sense that Blade was not making its 2025 release date. Marvel already has three films coming out in 2025 (Captain America: Brave New World, Thunderbolts, The Fantastic Four: First Steps), all of which are well into production. Blade, as you may remember, lost its latest director Yann Demange back in June, which wasn’t the first time that happened. Being taken off the release schedule is never a good thing but it’s not necessarily the kiss of death. Sony did something similar with Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse and obviously that’s happening. It just means more time is needed. io9 reached out to Marvel and a source there reiterated what Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige has been saying for some time now: Marvel wants to make Blade, but it doesn’t want to make it just to make it. It has to be right and it doesn’t want to rush just to hit a release date. Scooping up that release date though is Predator: Badlands, the freshly titled follow-up to Prey from director Dan Trachtenberg and starring Elle Fanning. Previously, we’d just been calling it Badlands but now that it’s officially getting a theatrical release, we guess Disney added the franchise name on there (see also: Alien Romulus). The film was shot in New Zealand and, though it’s not a direct sequel to Prey, is expected to be in the same universe. It’s hugely exciting that after the success of Prey, Predator is coming back to the big screen for the holiday season. Back to Blade though. While the film is currently undated, Marvel did solidify its future with the same announcement. Those three new 2028 release dates (February 18, 2028; May 5, 2028; and November 10, 2028) could be anything, especially since they’re all in the aftermath of Avengers: Secret Wars in May 2027. Could one of them be Blade? The return of Deadpool? A second Fantastic Four movie? Young Avengers? We don’t know and we’re guessing not even Marvel knows for sure yet. But it now gives them seven “untitled” slots on the release schedule from 2026-2028. Marvel isn’t going anywhere, and maybe Blade will lead the way when it’s ready. Are you optimistic we’ll ever see Blade? What are you thinking about the new Predator film? Let us know below. Want more io9 news?

            "content": "Over the past four years, the Dragon spacecraft has returned eight NASA crews by performing a parachute-assisted splashdown in the ocean, but the crew capsule now has a backup landing method in the event of an emergency. SpaceX’s Dragon can land propulsively using its eight SuperDraco thrusters, a feature that was originally intended to be the spacecraft’s main way of returning to Earth but was later scrapped due to safety concerns. During the live webcast of the Crew-9 launch on September 27, NASA officials announced that in the event that all four parachutes fail to deploy, Dragon would land on a solid surface using the SuperDracos launch abort system. “Dragon was always designed to land propulsively, but I didn’t want to risk it as the primary method,” SpaceX CEO Elon Musk wrote on X. During the early days of its development, SpaceX marketed Dragon’s ability to land using its eight SuperDraco engines, which would slow the spacecraft down during its descent until its velocity reached zero, at that point its landing legs would extend so the capsule can touch down on the pad. However, a lot can change in ten years. SpaceX’s Starship Looks Like an Alien Spacecraft as It Emerges from the Seafloor A few months after NASA awarded SpaceX its Commercial Crew Program contract, the company announced that its Dragon spacecraft would use parachutes to perform a splashdown with the astronauts rather than landing on a solid surface. It was later revealed that NASA felt more comfortable relying on the parachute landing system, according to NASA Spaceflight. The space agency also feared that the openings for the extendable legs could lead to the formation of hot spots during the spacecraft’s reentry through Earth’s atmosphere, which could cause the breakup of the crew capsule. During the launch webcast, Bill Gerstenmaier, vice president of build and flight reliability at SpaceX, noted that Dragons capable of making propulsive landing have flown on non-crewed missions before, but the Crew-9 mission marks the first time it’s being used on a NASA crewed mission. By now, NASA has plenty of reason to trust SpaceX and its ability to launch and return its crew of astronauts safely to Earth. The Dragon spacecraft that recently launched to the International Space Station is also responsible for bringing back two astronauts who had flown to orbit on board Boeing’s cursed Starliner spacecraft, which was later deemed unfit to return its crew back to Earth. That might have been why the Dragon spacecraft was finally allowed to keep its propulsive landing system handy in case of an emergency.   \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n      Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Some television stations and websites in Russia are offline for the second day in a row following what Moscow called an “unprecedented” attack on its digital infrastructure. The disruption began on October 7, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s birthday. On Monday Russian state-owned broadcaster VGTRK’s website and digital streaming services went off the air. The affected outlets included radio stations and TV channels such as Russia-1 and Russia-24. “Our state media holding, one of the largest, has faced an unprecedented hacker attack on its digital infrastructure,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a statement about the attack. VGTRK told Russian media that it had been attacked and was working around the clock to get services back online. “On the night of October 7, online services of VGTRK were subjected to an unprecedented hacker attack,” it said in a statement. “Specialists are working to find out all the circumstances, to understand where the traces left behind by those who organized this hacker attack on the critical infrastructure object lead.” As of this writing, the websites for VGTRK are still unresponsive. According to the Washington Post, state and local government-affiliated websites in Russia are also down. The Telegram channel for the court in the Vladimir region announced its websites were down for technical reasons. Courts in the city of Ufa postponed hearings. And courts in the Pskov region also announced they were delayed for technical reasons. A group of hackers calling itself the BO Team celebrated the hack on Telegram. “Happy Birthday dickhead,” BO Team posted, followed by four smiling poop emojis. A report in the Russian press didn’t name BO Team but, citing Russian intelligence sources, said that a group of hackers supported by the Ukrainian government was behind the attack. Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the attack. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was marked by an increase in cyber war on both sides. In 2015, Russia attacked Ukraine’s power grid with a Trojan virus called BlackEnergy. It tried something similar on Christmas the following year. Ukrainian-linked hackers have hit Russian TV stations multiple times with cyberattacks. On September 5 of this year, the U.S. government indicted five Russian GRU officers and one civilian, charging them with conspiring to hack the Ukrainian government. Picking Putin’s birthday to launch the attack is no coincidence. For decades, aspirants and detractors have used the Russian President’s birthday to get his attention and send a message. Putin’s perceived enemies tend to go missing or die around October 7. In 2006, famed Russian journalist Anna Politkovsk was assassinated in the elevator of her apartment. She’d been a fierce critic of Putin. \nCyberattackHackingKyivRussiaUkraine  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Law enforcement send \"emergency\" requests to tech giants when they believe it's necessary to stop an immediate threat.

            "content": "Update: It appears we spoke to soon, as the America PAC announced another winner Wednesday night. Elon Musk’s PAC has been giving away a $1 million prize every day to a random registered voter in one of several swing states who sign a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. The organization has also promised $47 to every registered voter who signs the petition. But it was reported yesterday that the Justice Department warned the group that the activity could be violating federal election law, and now it appears the giveaway has abruptly stopped. Axios reports that Musk’s America PAC, as the pro-Trump group is called, curiously did not announce a winner of the $1 million prize on Wednesday. Critics have said Musk’s giveaway was a thinly-veiled attempt at buying votes for Trump. The youth turnout in the U.S. is historically low, and the $1 million giveaway was only open to registered voters in states like Pennsylvania that could go to either candidate, suggesting that Musk was attempting to encourage the disillusioned to register—and return the favor of his giveaway by tipping the vote in Trump’s favor. Musk’s PAC The timing of the Justice Department’s warning was somewhat fortuitous for Musk. Voter registration closes in Pennsylvania—where he has been campaigning hard for Trump—15 days before the election, or October 21. So, Musk doesn’t really stand to gain much by continuing the giveaway at this point, and can stop doing it under the guise of the DOJ warning. He probably even considers the warning a relief. Musk has spoken about a potential Harris administration in increasingly alarmist terms, suggesting he would be thrown in prison if she wins the White House, and that “humanity will never reach Mars” under her guidance. These dark claims come despite the fact that Musk’s companies have grown tremendously under the Biden administration, with both SpaceX and Tesla receiving enormous support from the federal government and achieving momentous feats, such as the recent “chopstick” Starship landing. Yesterday, Tesla reported earnings for Q3 2024 which included a windfall of $739 million in straight profit from selling EV tax credits to other automakers. Those tax credits, of course, are government incentives meant to grow the EV industry. Things at his privately held social media company are going less well. If we’re being honest, his hatred towards Harris and the Democratic party probably comes down to President Biden excluding him from the White House EV summit. \nDonald TrumpElon Musk  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Just like in 2016, Donald Trump benefited from having a loud propagandist with access to an influential media bullhorn.\n         \n          Racists have become emboldened on the internet after Donald Trump's election win.\n         \n          OpenAI is going through a rough patch and it's Elon's turn to take revenge.\n         \n          Kevin Rudd called Trump \"the most destructive president in history\" during his Bible-holding photo-op in 2020.\n         \n          Donald Trump's victory was a bat-signal for Silicon Valley oligarchs.\n         \n          With control of the White House and the Senate, Republicans are poised to upend U.S. climate policy.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "The 2024 presidential campaign has been awash with fake stories about Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz in recent months, all spread by supporters of Donald Trump. But nowhere are these stories more abundant than X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, which was purchased in 2022 by far-right billionaire Elon Musk. And we can probably expect the ridiculous lies to get even worse in the last two weeks of the campaign as Musk pours millions into getting Trump elected. What do we mean by ridiculous lies? Take a recent story that went viral on X, purporting to be a testimonial from a former student of Tim Walz. The person in the video, falsely identified as a man named Matthew Metro, claimed they were sexually abused by Walz. But anyone actually from Minnesota would immediately notice some big red flags. For starters, the person claimed they were a student at Mankato West, the high school where Walz worked in the 1990s and early 2000s. But the person mispronounces the word Mankato and somehow even the word Minnesota sounds weird. 🚨BREAKING NEWS JUST ANNOUNCED:  Tim Walz's former student, Matthew Metro, posted a video online claiming he was sexually assaulted by Walz back in 1997.  If this is true, she's done. The Kamala Harris/ Tim Walz combo is done. It's over.#KamalaDumpsterFire pic.twitter.com/n6cgr70VrG — Matthew Cottrell (@MatthewLovesUSA) October 17, 2024  Why was this going viral? Because it was being promoted by X’s algorithm in the For You feed, as I personally experienced on October 6. But the Washington Post spoke to the Matthew Metro, apparently a name identified by the disinformation agents through a publicly posted yearbook, who now lives in Hawaii. “It’s obviously not me: The teeth are different, the hair is different, the eyes are different, the nose is different,” the 45-year-old Metro told the Washington Post. “I don’t know where they’re getting this from.” Wired talked with analysts who believe the video is the work of a Russian-aligned disinformation operation called Storm-1516, which also spread the false claim that Harris participated in a hit-and-run in San Francisco in 2011. But Wired also believes the video was created AI, something that not all experts are agreed on. All we know for certain is that the video is clearly fake and is being spread inorganically on X. Or take the viral video purporting to be an explosive bombshell about the time cocaine was found at the White House. Previously right-wing actors insisted without evidence that the cocaine must have belonged to Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden’s son. But ever since Biden dropped out of the race in July, many of those same conspiracy theories have been repurposed to somehow fit Harris. The video is made to look like an undercover hidden camera exposé, complete with night-vision green tinting, disguised voices, and a blurred face. But it’s all of these poorly executed details that make the video so obviously fake. For starters, if this was a real undercover video being shared by Trump supporters, why would they want to hide the identity of someone in the Biden White House, especially if the camera was ostensibly hidden? The creators mashed up two different techniques, undercover exposé and identity protection, which simply doesn’t make sense for the ostensible reason behind this video when you think about the context of this video for even a second. So the cocaine in the White House was Kamala Harris’s…..  No wonder why Joe Biden is pissed…. pic.twitter.com/QSR3V9HdUh — Zade Smith (@ZadeSmith4) October 3, 2024  There are also things about the video that are just laughably fake, like the crowd noises for what’s supposed to be a “bar.” Cellphone videos have been around long enough now that we all know what background noise for various environments sound like on camera. And this one is clearly just an audio file of stock background noises laid on top. It’s pretty pathetic. The script is full of right-wing ways of talking about Harris, pointing out her laugh and other things MAGA faithful hate about the vice president. Even the visual elements are just clearly someone’s basement rather than an actual bar. An account with the name Zade Smith that uses what appears to be an AI-generated image for an avatar was one of many that helped spread the fake video, racking up over 2 million hits alone. There’s also a line that seemed to be popular and spread on X by various accounts in a coordinated fashion, logging millions of views for the claim, even without the video: “New leaks indicate that it was Kamala Harris, not Hunter Biden who brought cocaine to the White House back in 2023.” Another story that went viral on X recently was the claim that a whistleblower with ABC News has tapes that would prove there was some kind of improper coordination between the Harris campaign and the news network before the presidential debate in September. The claim was started by an account known as “The Black Insurrectionist” but after spreading far and wide, while the “whistleblower” complaint even included a poorly photoshopped “affidavit” swearing to the authenticity of the claims, which got X’s legion of Trump fans really excited. The whistleblower even sent a letter to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, according to the Black Insurrectionist. But even right-wing influencers like former Fox News host Megyn Kelly had to admit it sounded fishy. And when Kelly reached out to Johnson’s office, they confirmed he never received any such letter. “We are now able to confirm the speaker’s office did not get the letter,” Kelly wrote on her website. “We have spoken with a source with direct knowledge who said Speaker Johnson’s office never received the document in question. Additionally, the alleged tapes have never been made public. The alleged whistleblower has never come forward. We were told he was possibly filing a lawsuit. That didn’t happen.” But that didn’t stop Trump from claiming collusion between the network and the Harris campaign. Whoever this supposed whistleblower was never came forward, obviously. And the original account that first spread this nonsense was deactivated by whoever was running it sometime around October 18, according to a BBC fact-checker. It really shouldn’t be any surprise that people who want to get Trump elected are spreading misinformation. They’ve been doing it for years. The only difference is they’re now getting major support from Musk to make sure as many people as possible see their garbage on big platforms like X. For its part, the Trump campaign is also spreading fake news even in official campaign events. Over the weekend, Trump appeared at a McDonald’s location in Feasterville-Trevose, Pennsylvania where he claimed to be “working” at the restaurant. In reality, the McDonald’s location was closed and supporters went through the drive-thru line to make it look like they were surprised to find Trump serving food. The video from the event is much funnier when you know that context, as people in the various cars try to act shocked that Trump was there. It was all staged to the last person. Trump is also repeatedly spreading bullshit about everything from FEMA to immigrants, sometimes combining the two lies, like he did Monday during a photo-op in North Carolina. “Now, you know, in theory, they’re supposed to have it, but they spent a lot of money on bringing illegal migrants, people that came into our country illegally, to the United States,” Trump said, lying through his teeth, “and taking them in, and all of the money they’ve spent, numbers that nobody can even believe. So they don’t have any money for the people that live here.” Trump on disaster aid: They are supposed to have it, but they spent a lot of money on bringing illegal migrants.. so they don't have any money for the people that live here.. pic.twitter.com/o16iUBy76X — Acyn (@Acyn) October 21, 2024  Trump has helped fuel conspiracy theories about Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which have both devastated people living in many southern states. But FEMA has dispersed millions in aid to people impacted by the hurricanes, no matter what Trump says. Roughly $1.8 billion in federal money for individuals and communities affected by both Helene and Milton has been approved by the White House as of last week. “Federal assistance for those affected by the hurricanes includes $597 million to support survivors with housing repairs, personal property replacement and other essential recovery efforts,” according to a FEMA press release dated Oct. 16. “Additionally, over $934 million has been approved for debris removal and emergency protective measures, which are necessary to save lives, protect public health and prevent further damage to public and private property.” There are precisely 15 days until the election is held on Nov. 5 and many people are already voting. But the polling is so close that it’s clearly a toss up at this point between Harris and Trump. Again, we’re almost certain to see many more dirty tricks on X over the next two weeks. But voters need to take everything they see with a grain of salt, especially on social media platforms owned by MAGA billionaires who are donating $75 million and counting to Trump. \ndebunkersDonald TrumpFakesFEMAkamala harrisMcDonald’s  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Just like in 2016, Donald Trump benefited from having a loud propagandist with access to an influential media bullhorn.\n         \n          Racists have become emboldened on the internet after Donald Trump's election win.\n         \n          OpenAI is going through a rough patch and it's Elon's turn to take revenge.\n         \n          Kevin Rudd called Trump \"the most destructive president in history\" during his Bible-holding photo-op in 2020.\n         \n          Donald Trump's victory was a bat-signal for Silicon Valley oligarchs.\n         \n          With control of the White House and the Senate, Republicans are poised to upend U.S. climate policy.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Elon Musk, a far-right influencer who also happens to be one of the wealthiest people in the world, formed a political action committee in May called America PAC, a group dedicated to re-electing former president Donald Trump. And the PAC’s quarterly filing with the Federal Election Commission was posted publicly late Tuesday, revealing Musk has donated almost $75 million since July 3. That sum makes Musk one of the biggest contributors to Trump-aligned propaganda groups in this election cycle. Musk responded overnight on X to news of his donations being made public that his America PAC, “is just aiming for common sense, centrist values.” It should be noted, of course, that this is horseshit. It’s complete and utter horseshit, since Trump is a racist, convicted felon and sexual predator who dismantled abortion rights in this country and promises to be a dictator on day one. You know, centrist stuff. The Wall Street Journal reported back on July 16 that Musk was likely to donate around $45 million per month to his PAC, a claim the Tesla CEO initially denied. Musk tweeted a graphic that read “fake gnus” about the initial report, leading many of his defenders to think he wasn’t donating anything. But that wasn’t the case, obviously.  pic.twitter.com/RJdF7MWeEi — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 16, 2024  Musk later admitted he was contributing money to America PAC, just not $45 million per month. The billionaire didn’t elaborate, creating a guessing game for the general public as it became increasingly clear that Musk had inserted himself into the election cycle. Aside from promoting pro-Trump content on the social media site he purchased, formerly known as Twitter, Musk also appeared at an Oct. 5 rally for Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he jumped around like an awkward toddler, exposing his stomach and generally making a fool of himself. But the day when we would finally learn how much money Musk had donated was inevitably going to come around. In reality, the tech mogul donated $14.95 million in July, $30 million in August, and $30 million in September, according to the FEC filing, totaling $74.95 million. The FEC filing covers donations from July 1 to Sept. 30, so it’s unclear if Musk has made any donations in the past two weeks. And while Musk’s initial donations weren’t reaching the level of $45 million per month, as the Wall Street Journal claimed, it was still a good chunk of money. Musk also knows quite well that this was the last FEC filing before the election on Nov. 5, so there’s plenty of time for Musk to inject more cash before any of it can be made public. Musk’s donations: What does all of this money get spent on? The group buys digital ads on platforms like Google, YouTube, and Facebook in an effort to convince people that Trump, a convicted felon and racist dullard, is actually the person who should run this country again. There are also a handful of ads for Republicans in very competitive House races. Some of the ads even feature Musk himself, imploring people to “fight, fight, fight” and “vote, vote, vote” for Trump, like in the ad below, one that’s currently running on YouTube. The Facebook ads are particularly embarrassing, given the fact that they promise anyone who requests a mail-in ballot for the upcoming election will get their name sent to Trump at his home in Mar-a-Lago. Some of the ads even refer to something called the 47 Club, a reference to Trump hoping to be the 47th president. “The 47 Club isn’t for everyone. It’s an elite group Trump trusts,” the narrator says. “To become a member, you must do one thing. Request a mail-in ballot. Once you do, your name is going straight to Mar-a-Lago. Vote by mail and save America.” The style seems to mimic the “secret” membership clubs promoted by toy and cereal manufacturers in the 1950s and 60s when the target audience of Boomers were children. The implication is that Trump himself will see their name, though anyone who’s impressed by that transparently fake promise probably isn’t smart enough to sign their own name on a ballot, let alone operate a computer. America PAC also made headlines recently when it promised to give $47 cash to anyone who signs a “petition” in a swing state that pledges to support the First and Second Amendments. The ploy is clearly a way to collect personal information on voters in battleground states, though it’s not clear how many people have actually participated nor whether they’ll actually get paid. It’s also unclear what the information will be used for this close to the election. The group also pays people to go door-to-door and ask them to vote for Trump. But new reports from the Washington Post and the Guardian about on-the-ground activities of the group make the entire endeavor sound like a disorganized shitshow. And that probably won’t come as a surprise to many people, given Musk’s reputation as a man who mismanages so many aspects of his businesses. America PAC reportedly pays workers between $20-40 per hour to knock on doors and convince likely Trump voters in crucial swing states to get out and vote early. But those workers appears to sometimes have bad info, according to the Post, often coming upon homes occupied by people who say they’ll vote for Kamala Harris or undecided voters who are hard to persuade. The workers use an app called Campaign Sidekick which can be glitchy, as the Washington Post reports, and requires fast mobile connections to work as intended. That’s obviously a problem in more rural areas of battleground states like Wisconsin, where the Post spoke with a worker who was out knocking on doors. When a given worker doesn’t have a fast mobile connection, they’re supposed to use the app in “offline” mode, which presents even more challenges, according to the Guardian, since it doesn’t upload completed routes properly as the news outlet tells it. Tracking those routes is essential to ensure workers are hitting the right houses but also to guarantee efforts aren’t being duplicated. Campaign Sidekick didn’t immediately respond to a message Tuesday but pushed back to the Guardian against claims the app is glitchy, “saying it has always been upfront about the limitations of offline walkbook.” To complicate things further, the workers may not even be properly engaging people when they go out on their routes, according to the Guardian, with some staff just “speed-running” an assigned route and throwing campaign materials at the door without knocking. Workers are paid by the number of doors they knock, which creates even more bad incentives for people who may not be true believers in MAGA’s fascist cause. It all sounds like a mess, obviously. But that’s to be expected on some level with paid staff hired in a rush. And it sounds like everything really has been in a rush. The Post reports that some of Musk’s early political advisors warned him that he was trying to move things too quickly, given the time available before the election, “cautioning that it would require months more to properly hire and train the necessary staff.” But doing things too quickly and trying to deal with the fallout is kind of Musk’s entire playbook, as anyone who saw the smoke and mirrors at Tesla’s big Cybercab event last week can attest. The newspaper also notes that Musk fired at least three vendors over the summer just as they were about to get started, making an already condensed timeline even more chaotic. And Musk has been micromanaging things in a frustrating way, according to multiple reports that date back to September. Musk endorsed Trump shortly after the former president was shot at during one of his neo-fascist rallies in Butler, Pennsylvania. And Musk has said that he believes Democrats will put him in prison if Trump doesn’t win, though it’s not entirely clear why he might think that. Musk also reportedly banned a reporter from X for releasing a dossier on JD Vance after the Trump campaign coordinated with the billionaire. That reporter has since been reinstated to Musk’s social media platform after the coordination became public. The race between Trump and Harris is still neck-and-neck if you can believe it, with FiveThirtyEight’s polling average showing Harris up just 2.4% in the national polling. Things are even tighter in the must-win states of Wisconsin, where Harris is up just 0.5%, Pennsylvania, where she’s up just 0.7% and Michigan, where she’s also up just 0.7%. It’s going to be a close one if the polls are to be believed. \nAmerica PACDonald TrumpElon Muskkamala harris  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Just like in 2016, Donald Trump benefited from having a loud propagandist with access to an influential media bullhorn.\n         \n          Racists have become emboldened on the internet after Donald Trump's election win.\n         \n          OpenAI is going through a rough patch and it's Elon's turn to take revenge.\n         \n          Kevin Rudd called Trump \"the most destructive president in history\" during his Bible-holding photo-op in 2020.\n         \n          Donald Trump's victory was a bat-signal for Silicon Valley oligarchs.\n         \n          With control of the White House and the Senate, Republicans are poised to upend U.S. climate policy.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "After years of pressure from environmental advocates, the global retail giant Amazon announced last week that it has eliminated plastic air pillows from its global network of “fulfillment centers,” as Amazon calls its warehouse and distribution facilities. Around the world, products inside the company’s packages are now cushioned by paper-based padding that can be collected in curbside recycling programs. “We are committed to improving how orders are shipped, for the good of customers and the planet,” Amazon wrote in a blog post. The announcement represents the fulfillment of a promise Amazon made in June to work “toward full removal” of plastic air pillows from North America by the end of the year. At that time, the company said it had already replaced 95 percent of its air pillows across the continent with paper filler. Years before that, in 2021, Amazon eliminated plastic air pillows in Australia, and in 2022 it did the same for orders shipped from its warehouses in Europe. Oceana, a nonprofit ocean advocacy group, has dogged Amazon for several years over its  use of plastics, largely through a series of reports quantifying the company’s overall plastic footprint and its contribution to aquatic plastic pollution. Matt Littlejohn, Oceana’s senior vice president for strategic initiatives, said Amazon’s announcement is “actually quite significant,” even though the phaseout doesn’t apply to orders shipped by third-party sellers. Amazon hasn’t disclosed what fraction of its sales are fulfilled in that way. “It’s great news for the oceans and for the globe in general that the world’s biggest e-commerce company did this,” Littlejohn said. Still, Amazon continues to use tens of thousands of tons of plastic every year in other forms of packaging—much of it thin, filmy plastic used in delivery bags and padded mailers. Plastic film is not only virtually impossible to recycle, but also the most common form of plastic litter in coastal waters and the most lethal type of plastic to large marine animals. Oceana and other environmental groups say the company should strengthen its plastic-reduction promises by setting deadlines to move away from all types of single-use plastic packaging, and scaling up reusable alternatives. “We want the company to make a commitment to do more,” Littlejohn told Grist. He said Amazon’s actions could influence other large retailers to also reduce their plastics use. Amazon is one of the largest companies in the world, with an estimated value near $2 trillion and annual revenue above $600 billion. It operates in 21 countries and ships to many more. In the U.S., Amazon controls nearly 40 percent of the e-commerce market. So far, Amazon’s greatest progress on plastic reduction has happened in international jurisdictions, potentially due to stronger regulations on single-use plastics. The company’s warehouses in India have been plastic packaging-free since 2020, and its European distribution centers stopped using plastic delivery bags in 2022. Those changes contributed to a 9 percent self-reported decline in global plastic use between 2022 and 2023, according to an Amazon spokesperson. Plastic reduction has been slower in the U.S., perhaps because of the sheer size of its largest market. Oceana has estimated that Amazon generated 208 million pounds of plastic packaging trash in the United States in 2022—about 10 percent more than the previous year—although this doesn’t account for the company’s most recent efforts to transition to paper. In its recent blog post, Amazon said it has now retrofitted more than 120 automated packing machines across the country so they can make paper bags, rather than plastic ones. Amazon also hinted in its 2022 sustainability report that it was “phasing out padded bags containing plastics,” presumably referring to its ubiquitous blue-and-white mailers. Littlejohn said Amazon should make this commitment more precise by clarifying its geographical scope and a timeline for accomplishing it. The company also said in its most recent sustainability report that it’s “working to reduce our use of single-use plastic packaging in favor of household-recyclable alternatives.” Littlejohn said that the emphasis on curbside recycling — instead of specialty take-back programs at retail stores — is meaningful. Currently, the company’s blue-and-white mailers feature a label directing customers to “store drop-off” recycling receptacles at locations like Kohl’s, Safeway, and Stop & Shop. But investigations from the media and environmental groups have shown that plastic collected in these receptacles is often sent to landfills and incinerators, rather than to a recycler. Plastic film that does get reprocessed is downgraded into nonrecyclable products like deck chairs. In response to Grist’s request for comment, an Amazon spokesperson pointed to previously announced plastic reduction efforts, including the complete elimination of plastic packaging from two U.S. distribution facilities. “We recognize the importance of reducing single-use plastic, in the U.S. and globally, but this can’t be done overnight,” the spokesperson wrote in an email. They went on to say that Amazon is “obsessed with getting this right for customers, and we’re incredibly proud of the progress so far.” Amazon also said in its blog post from last week that its first priority is “to remove packaging altogether,” meaning it tries to ship products in their original packaging rather than adding Amazon-branded sleeves, bags, boxes, and padding. As of December of last year, Amazon was shipping one-third of its sales in North America without any additional packaging, and it said it would increase this fraction to two-thirds by December 2024. As You Sow is a nonprofit shareholder advocacy organization that has filed several resolutions at Amazon asking the company to disclose and reduce its plastic packaging footprint. Conrad MacKerron, the organization’s senior vice president, noted that there are still plenty of opportunities outside of Amazon’s e-commerce business to cut down on unnecessary plastic packaging. For example, he said, Amazon sells many private-label food and beverage products that are packed in flexible plastic, like bags of nuts and candies. These products contribute to plastic pollution, even if they’re shipped to buyers in a paper envelope. Amazon also owns Whole Foods, one of the largest grocery chains in the United States, where entire aisles of products are sold in flimsy plastic packaging that is virtually impossible to recycle. Many of these products are sold under the Amazon-owned label 365 by Whole Foods Market. “Unlike PET bottles, that flexible packaging cannot be recycled really anywhere in the world at this point. All of that goes to the landfill,” MacKerron said.

            "content": "More than 50 years after Apollo, astronauts will be returning to the Moon in style. Axiom Space, NASA’s commercial partner, unveiled the final look of its designer spacesuits built for exploring the lunar surface. During the International Astronautical Congress, Axiom revealed the flight design of its next generation suit, designed in partnership with luxury brand Prada. The company showed off its Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit (AxEMU) without the dark layer that covered the spacesuit when it was first revealed over a year ago. Instead, the suit’s final form is that familiar white material that reflects heat and protects astronauts from lunar dust. In 2022, NASA tasked Axiom Space with developing the first moonwalking spacesuits since the Apollo missions, which will be worn by astronauts on the lunar surface as part of the space agency’s Artemis program. Less than a year later, Axiom Space unveiled the AxEMU spacesuit under its initial $228.5 million contract. The first look at the AxEMU spacesuits featured a dark cover layer used to conceal its proprietary technology. The final flight design shows off all the different capabilities of the suit, including an onboard health monitoring system for the astronauts, a cooling system, coatings on the helmet and visor to enhance astronauts’ view of their surroundings, and pressure garments, according to Axiom Space. Spacesuits, Ranked The next generation spacesuits are designed to give astronauts more range of motion and enhanced safety while exploring the lunar surface, and it is designed with more sizing and adjustability options to fit a wide range of people. AxEMU was developed to reflect the legacy of NASA spacesuits while incorporating new technology, more mobility, and better protection from the lunar environment. It’s been a long time coming, with the current design worn by NASA astronauts dating back to more than 40 years ago. With its flight design finally revealed, the modern, sleek look of the AxEMU spacesuit came through. Axiom Space partnered with Prada to draw on the brand’s expertise on design and material, while also trying to provide an aesthetically pleasing look for the astronauts on the Moon. “I’m very proud of the result we’re showing today…We’ve shared our expertise on high-performance materials, features, and sewing techniques, and we learned a lot,” Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada Group’s chief marketing officer, said in a statement. The AxEMU spacesuit is made to be worn by astronauts on NASA’s Artemis 3 mission, which is set to launch in September 2026. The suit is “nearing the final development stage,” according to Axiom Space, having completed a pressurized simulation with NASA and SpaceX for the Artemis 3 mission. “We are pioneering a new era in space exploration where partnerships are imperative to the commercialization of space,” Russell Ralston, executive vice president of Extravehicular Activity at Axiom Space, said in a statement. “For the first time, we are leveraging expertise in other industries to craft a better solution for space.”   \nArtemisAxiom SpaceNASAspacesuit  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Vega provided the first telescopic evidence of a disk of planet-forming material, but there are no planets to be found around this star.\n         \n          The four astronauts were hospitalized after returning from an eight-month stay on board the ISS.\n         \n          The space station is getting closer to retirement, and it's still in need of a deorbiting vehicle to lower it to its fiery death.\n         \n          Instead of relying on fasteners to keep structures together in space, astronauts may need to use lasers to weld on the lunar surface.\n         \n          The spunky probe's final gravity assist around Venus will put it on track to break records near the Sun next month.\n         \n          A crew of astronauts was recently hospitalized following a return to Earth on board SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "After years of excitement and anticipation, we finally know when Universal Studios will open its fourth Orlando theme park, Epic Universe. The company just announced that the park will open May 22, 2025, with distinct lands themed to How to Train Your Dragon, Harry Potter, Nintendo, Universal Monsters, and more. That may seem like a long way away, but not if you’re a theme park fan. An opening date means it’s time to make travel plans, and Universal also announced that tickets for the park, and rooms at its new Universal Helios Grand Hotel, all go up for sale/reservation on October 22. As previously rumored though, most admission to Epic Universe in what Universal is calling its “First Phase” is only available as part of a larger ticket package that includes entrance to the other theme parks: Universal Studios Florida, Islands of Adventure, and Volcano Bay. So what does that mean? Well, you can click here for all the specifics but basically, if you want to go to Epic Universe starting May 22, 2025, you’ll need to buy a multi-day ticket that’ll give you just one day at the park. Single-day tickets will be available on their own, but only to annual pass holders at the start and those sales begin October 24. As for people who may just want to pop into Epic Universe alone, “Additional ticket options for Universal Epic Universe—including single-day tickets for the general public and more—will go on sale in the months ahead.” Again, visit the official Epic Universe site for specific details on all that, as well as on the new hotel. “This is such a pivotal moment for our destination, and we’re thrilled to welcome guests to Epic Universe next year,” Karen Irwin, President and COO of Universal Orlando Resort, said in a press release. “With the addition of this spectacular new theme park, our guests will embark on an unforgettable vacation experience with a week’s worth of thrills that will be nothing short of epic! Our Universe will never be the same.” That last phrase is key. Yes, it would be awesome to be among the first to visit Epic Universe, ride its rides, and discover its secrets. But it’s not going anywhere. It will be there from May 2025 until forever so if you want to go, but can’t fathom paying admission for three parks to visit one, just sit tight. In the months and years ahead there will be plenty of time to visit Celestial Park, the Ministry of Magic, Super Nintendo World, How to Train Your Dragon‘s Isle of Berk, and Dark Universe.

            "content": "It’s no secret that Mattel laughed all the way to the bank last year thanks to the humongous box office success of director Greta Gerwig and actor Margot Robbie’s Barbie movie. While some of its success could be credited to the cinematic phenomenon known as Barbenheimer, Mattel—like any self-respecting company that sees no ceiling to the potential financial success of repeating a past idea—was soon back at work trying to decide which toy to turn into a movie next. Lo and behold, the bigwigs have finally arrived at their answer: the View-Master. No, we’re not kidding. According to Variety, Mattel is officially working on a live-action film about its 1940s-era 3D stereoscopic toy in collaboration with Sony Pictures and Escape Artists (the folks behind The Equalizer 3 and Mattel’s long-delayed live-action Masters of the Universe Amazon film). This next sentence would typically be the place were we’d write about noteworthy directors, writers, and actors tasked with breathing life into this expensive advertisement of a film, but there’s are none as of time of publication. It’s just View-Master. Same as it ever was. Be that as it may, the View-Master movie’s current lack of enticing names attached to it hasn’t hampered Mattel Films president Robbie Brenner and Escape Artist producer Todd Black’s excitement. “View-Master has inspired generations to embark on boundless adventures, offering a treasure trove of storytelling possibilities for this film,” Brenner said. “We’re thrilled to work with Sony Pictures Entertainment and Escape Artists’ Todd Black to bring this Mattel franchise to life. Their creative and filmmaking expertise sets the stage to introduce a modern take on this beloved toy to audiences everywhere.” “View-Master has long been a window to the wonders of the world, sparking imagination in kids and adults alike,” Black echoed. “Teaming up with Robbie Brenner and Mattel Films gives us the chance to honor that legacy while creating an entirely new adventure for today’s audience. We can’t wait to bring this treasured toy’s sense of exploration to the big screen.” While the View-Master movie isn’t the most enticing title to announce ahead of New York Comic Con, Mattel does have other projects down the pipeline that are more exciting and have names attached to them. Key among them include a Hot Wheels movie with director J.J. Abrams attached; a live-action Barney movie starring Nope and Get Out‘s Daniel Kaluuya; a Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots movie with Vin Diesel; and an Uno-inspired “action heist movie” involving rapper Lil Yachty. For Mattel’s sake, here’s hoping any combination of these disparate projects bring in beaucoup bucks like Barbie did. Who do you think should star in the View-Master movie? Want more io9 news?

            "content": "Lina Khan, the head of the Federal Trade Commission, has proven to be a contentious figure—arguably because, unlike some of the FTC chairs who came before her, she seems intent on actually doing her job. Under her chairmanship, the FTC has aggressively pursued actions against some of America’s largest tech companies, ruffling the feathers of Silicon Valley C-suites. As a result, there are more than a few people who want to see her gone when the next administration—be it Trump or Harris—enters the White House. A new report suggests there’s a good chance that Harris will keep Khan, should she win the presidency. The political outlet NOTUS writes that one of Harris’ top economic advisers, Brian Deese, has “advocated” for Harris to keep the young federal official in her role. The outlet cites two sources familiar with the campaign. Gizmodo reached out to the Harris campaign for comment. The list of tech executives that have taken shots at Khan is long. Earlier this year, LinkedIn billionaire and Democratic Party donor Reid Hoffman made waves when he publicly suggested that, should she win the presidency, Harris should fire Khan. Hoffman said that Khan was “not helping America” and that he hoped that “Vice President Harris would replace her.” Notably, Hoffman is a major investor in Microsoft, which has been under fire from Khan’s agency over its various business deals. Hoffman later appeared on Jake Tapper’s show on CNN and tried to defend himself against accusations of influence peddling. Other tech companies have also been critical of the regulator. Last summer, lawyers for the company then known as Twitter accused Khan’s agency of being biased against the platform and its new owner, Elon Musk. According to Jon Stewart, he was instructed by officials at Apple not to interview Khan during his short-lived Apple TV show, The Problem with Jon Stewart. Amazon once accused Khan of having unfairly “made up her mind” about “Amazon’s antitrust culpability.” It isn’t hard to imagine that other corporate goliaths who have been the subject of FTC scrutiny (like Meta, for instance) are also, presumably not fans of hers. As FTC head, Khan has initiated a number of aggressive actions against the tech industry’s biggest players. Last September, Khan sued Amazon, alleging it had exerted illegal monopoly power over markets that allowed it to inflate prices and reduce product quality. Last year, the FTC under Khan proposed a blanket prohibition on Meta’s monetization of youth data. In 2022, Khan’s FTC sued to disrupt the merger between Microsoft and Blizzard-Activision, though her efforts were ultimately thwarted by a federal judge. The FTC has also sought to unwind Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp (though that effort predates Khan’s tenure with the agency, it has continued under her leadership). Khan has also probed the relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft and expressed concerns for the growing concentration of power within the AI industry, and has sought to spotlight the vast growth of consumer surveillance via adtech in the United States. \nFTCkamala harrisLina Khan  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Musk has spent at least $120 million to get Donald Trump elected.\n         \n          The ads are tied to a dark money group that receives millions from Elon Musk.\n         \n          Trump is currently up just 0.2% over Harris in 538's polling average for Nevada.\n         \n          A social media account claiming to be run by a Black veteran was allegedly tied to a white guy from upstate New York.\n         \n          When her lawn signs kept disappearing, one Missouri woman turned to innovative measures.\n         \n          The FTC's ban on writing, buying, or selling fake reviews is officially in effect.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Next week will be a big one for Apple. Hot off the presses with its 7th-gen iPad mini, the Cupertino, California company is about to debut “an exciting week of announcements” starting Monday. Whatever could that mean? We already have a pretty good idea based on some reliable rumors. It’s going to be the next step in iOS 18, plus a sweeping reveal of all-new MacBook Pros, Mac Minis, and iMacs all sporting the M4 chip. On Thursday, Apple’s senior vice president of marketing, Greg Joswiak, tweeted a terse message, telling Apple fans to “stay tuned.” You don’t have to be a Sherlock Holmes-level sleuth to tell it’s going to be new Mac products. The main image shown includes a neon glowing Finder icon that transforms into the Apple logo. Also, Joswiak wants us to “Mac” our calendars, so yes, Apple’s giving up the ghost hiding its future product plans, just in time for Halloween. Mac (😉) your calendars! We have an exciting week of announcements ahead, starting on Monday morning. Stay tuned… pic.twitter.com/YnoCYkZq6c — Greg Joswiak (@gregjoz) October 24, 2024  That statement doesn’t indicate an actual video event like Apple did last year when it debuted the M3 MacBook Pros. However, it’s more likely the company will drop these new MacBooks in press releases as it did the iPad mini last week. Apple has already made it clear we’ll get the official release of iOS 18.1 on Monday. Barring any surprises, the rest of that time will be taken up with Macs. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, normally the most reliable Apple rumormonger, reports we’ll see these products sometime at the end of October. The rumor mill says Apple will have a lower-end 14-inch MacBook Pro with the base M4 chip. Then, the company will sell 16-inch versions with an M4 Pro and/or an M4 Max chip. Bringing up the rear may be a refreshed 24-inch iMac to replace the M3 version. All these devices will look very, very similar to the last two iterations, as much as we might wish the notch housing the webcam would finally bite the dust. The most significant release next week will likely be the revised Mac Mini. It’s supposed to be smaller than the M2 version and support three USB-C ports and a HDMI connection. We’ll have to see if any Mac Mini models use the M4 Pro rather than the base M4. The M4 chip entered the scene with the 2024 iPad Pro. It should be slightly more powerful than the M3 in laptop form, though we need to wait and see how well it does in benchmarks. The reason Apple’s making this new push is to help support a bigger NPU in its desktop products, better to support the upcoming Apple Intelligence features in macOS Sequoia. Gurman wrote on Thursday that Apple plans to refresh the MacBook Airs with M4 chips as well. We might see those sometime between January and March, according to the Apple rumormonger.

            "content": "Nintendo announced late Tuesday evening that the still-unannounced Switch 2 console will be backwards compatible. However, we still don’t know if your cartridges will be as usable as ever in 2025. Nintendo came out with the news shortly after it revealed that it expects to sell less Switch hardware than it hoped to by the end of the year. Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa took to Twitter/X to say, “Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch.” More than that, you’ll be able to keep your Nintendo Switch Online account on the sequel Switch. This is Furukawa. At today's Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch. Nintendo Switch Online will be available on the successor to Nintendo Switch as well. Further information about… — 任天堂株式会社（企業広報・IR） (@NintendoCoLtd) November 6, 2024  Furukawa’s message leaves a big hole in players’ expectations. His last point about “compatibility with Nintendo Switch” hints that Switch cartridges may not be fully compatible with the new console. In all likelihood, players’ downloaded games will be portable, but Nintendo may have to do some extra magic trickery to facilitate physical media. The full Corporate Management Policy Briefing Furukawa is referencing doesn’t offer many more hints of what’s coming. Nintendo references the Nintendo Switch Online account as the main way it plans to “maintain a continuous relationship with the consumer across platform generations.” The company said it would use the “Nintendo Account” to carry over its “good relationship” with players. This implies Nintendo will focus most of its backwards compatibility through Switch Online. The Japanese game maker clarified that you can buy older Switch titles on the Switch 2. However, any details on compatibility will be officially revealed “at a later date.” More info from Nintendo (Corporate Management Policy Briefing) https://t.co/9grc34jhwo pic.twitter.com/pPu1Opm8t5 — Wario64 (@Wario64) November 6, 2024  At the very least, Nintendo is sticking to its guns and says it plans to announce the console this fiscal year, which ends in March 2025. Having a sequel Switch on the horizon hasn’t done anything to help hardware sales. Nintendo reported it lowered its sales projections for both Switch hardware and software. The company now expects to sell 12.5 million units instead of 13.5 million. Hardware sales for the base console, Switch OLED, and Switch Lite were down 31% year over year for the three months ending in September. Nintendo blamed the drop in sales numbers on a lack of high-profile games and tie-in properties, specifically Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The company still claimed sales were better than past consoles going into their eighth year of existence. That’s why Nintendo is going out of its way to let consumers know they’re still safe buying Switch software for friends and family this holiday season. There’s the release of Mario & Luigi: Brothership to look forward to on Thursday, Nov. 7, plus a few more revamps and re-releases previously announced at Nintendo’s June Direct. Otherwise, no big tentpole franchises are coming just yet. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is supposed to arrive next year. We still think it will be the big game to straddle Switch 1 and Switch 2, but we suggest if you buy anything now, you look at the digital version first. \nNintendoNintendo SwitchNintendo Switch 2  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Emulator designers spend years creating an environment where you can enjoy games you can't buy anymore.

            "content": "A dolphin’s butchered corpse was discovered on a New Jersey beach last week, so, naturally, the internet is now exploding with jokes about flop presidential candidate and MAGA convert Robert F. Kennedy Jr. being the culprit. If you’ll recall, Kennedy’s dismal political campaign was basically just one long string of scandals, a weird amount of which involved dead and mutilated animals. First he was accused of eating a dog. Then he admitted that in 2014 he’d dumped a bear cub carcass in Central Park. At one point, he bragged about having a freezer full of roadkill in his house. Then, in August, he was federally investigated after it came to light that he’d cut a whale’s head off with a chainsaw. Understandably, the recent appearance of a dead, mangled animal has the internet turning an accusatory eye to the Kennedy scion. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center, a Jersey-based non-profit dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation, and release of distressed local marine mammals and turtles, said in a press release Friday that a dolphin’s “butchered” body had been discovered on a beach in Allenhurst, New Jersey. “The animal’s flesh had been completely removed with clean cuts from a sharp instrument, leaving only the head, dorsal fin and flukes,” a statement reads. “The animal’s organs, except for the heart and lungs, had been removed.” The night before the animal was discovered, a live dolphin was spotted in the surf not far away, MMSC said, while noting that it’s unclear whether this was the same animal. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Law Enforcement is now investigating the death, the MMSC said. Those wondering about the Jack-the-Ripper-type maniac who stole the aquatic mammal’s innards wasted no time in pointing the finger (if only jokingly) at RFK. Yes, the tweets so far have been good: “Aw shit I didn’t realize RFK came to town,” said one smart-ass on X. Another person, who also shared the story on the platform, said: “I’m guessing RFK Fr. sorted an alibi already.” Yet another poster quipped that Trump had officially “lost the dolphin vote.”  There's a non-zero chance that this was RFK doing a dolphin sacrifice ahead of the election pic.twitter.com/qL1roCqzMp — Fifty Shades of Whey (@davenewworld_2) November 5, 2024  To our knowledge, Kennedy had nothing to do with the dolphin’s death, though it would be great if he issued an alibi for Friday night so we know for sure. Overall, the MAGA-verse doesn’t have a great track record when it comes to animal welfare. Sure, for the past week, rightwing influencers have been expressing outrage over the euthanization of a New York squirrel, but the primary reason for their anger seems to be government overreach, not a woodland creature’s well-being. No, for the most part, Trump’s allies seem to be hounded by strange allegations involving animals. Case in point: Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation (and, thus, one of the key proponents of the dystopian Project 2025) was accused of bragging about killing a dog with a shovel (Roberts has denied this). In an upcoming book, Roberts also apparently complained that the existence of dog parks was an example of the creep of “antifamily culture.” JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, has also been accused (mostly jokingly) of liking dolphin porn. Of course, there’s more at stake for the animal kingdom this election than dog parks and dolphin porn. Trump, whose first administration was not known for being particularly environmentally friendly, has allies who have advocated for the gutting of the Endangered Species Act. They also want to open up long-protected national parks for mining and federal lands for urban development. It’s unlikely that the natural world will benefit much if he gets into office again. \nRFK JrTrump  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          A study found that the cost of consoles, monitors, and other gaming goods might jump during Trump's presidency.\n         \n          Trump said Robert F.

            "content": "The Doobie Brothers sang “Listen to the music” as the crowd shuffled into the town hall last night at Oaks, Pennsylvania. It was a prophetic tune. Following two medical emergencies in the crowd, Trump decided to turn up the music. For 39 straight minutes, the candidate wandered the stage while his favorite tunes played. The Trump playlist is the stuff of legend. At Mar-a-Lago, Trump is in charge of the tunes. With an iPad hooked up to the sound system, Trump cranks the volume and loses himself in the same dozen or so songs. He loves to force people to listen to his music. The rally-goers in Pennsylvania got a taste of that last night. The crowd was restless about 40 minutes in. It was hot in town hall and supporters were waving their Trump signs like fans to keep cool. Trump tried to get his people to open the doors and cool the place off, but the Secret Service wouldn’t let them. “It’s steaming in here,” someone shouted from the crowd. Two people fainted. Wilting in the heat, the President often sat in silence and waited for something to happen. South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem was on stage and she attempted to keep him on track to no avail. She’d ask a question and he’d talk for a little bit but he wasn’t into it and the crowd wasn’t into it. She joked about the lack of AC in the building. “Maybe they can’t afford it,” she said. Trump seemed to make a decision. “Let’s make this a music fest.” “Let’s listen to Pavarotti sing Ave Maria,” he said. After a minute of rambling, the music came on. “Nice and loud. Turn it up louder. We want a little action here. Turn it up louder.” As the songs ran on, Trump kept pressing his people to turn it up. “Let me hear that music please. Loud. Nice and loud,” he said. The opera gave way to disco. “YMCA” by the Village People. “So play YMCA, let’s go, nice and loud,” Trump said, gyrating and shaking his fists close to his head while making a face. “There’s nobody leaving. What’s going on?” He said after the song ended. Then the Rufus Wainwright version of Hallelujah” came on. “Should we keep going? Alright, turn that music up. Turn it up. Great song,” Trump said. This rolled into “Nothing Compares 2 U” by Sinéad O’Connor then “An American Trilogy” by Elvis Presley then “Rich Men North of Richmond” by Oliver Anthony then “November Rain” by Guns and Roses. At some point, Noem left. As the evening wound down and Trump himself worked his way through the crowd, the speakers played “Memories” from the musical Cats, a longtime Trump favorite. \nMusicSPOTIFYTrump  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          A study found that the cost of consoles, monitors, and other gaming goods might jump during Trump's presidency.\n         \n          Trump said Robert F.

            "content": "After Epic Games, Xbox plans to be the next big app seller to break free of Google’s shackles. Microsoft’s gaming arm announced on Twitter that it would allow Android users to purchase games for their Xbox account through the Android Xbox app. Sure, you’re still unable to play your favorite Game Pass games on mobile unless you’re streaming, but it could prove to be Microsoft’s first step into opening its own true app store on Android phones. In a Twitter post, Xbox President Sarah Bond said that players can purchase Xbox games through the Xbox App starting sometime in November. She explicitly referred to California federal Judge James Donato’s recent ruling in the Epic v. Google legal battle that “open[ed] up Google’s mobile store in the U.S.” “Our mission is to allow more players to play on more devices,” she said, adding, “Starting in November, Players will be able to play and purchase Xbox Games” from the Xbox app. That may be a vague promise for now, but we know that the company’s long had dreams of operating its own mobile app store. Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard also gave Xbox access to King Digital Entertainment titles, home of the still-popular Candy Crush Saga. The court's ruling to open up Google´s mobile store in the US will allow more choice and flexibility. Our mission is to allow more players to play on more devices so we are thrilled to share that starting in November, players will be able to play and purchase Xbox games directly… — BondSarahBond (@BondSarah_Bond) October 10, 2024  According to a statement to The Verge in August, the company was working on a browser-based mobile store that was “progressing” as late as August. It’s unclear if Microsoft plans to scrap the store in exchange for its revitalized app. Currently, you have to go through the company’s web store page to purchase games or a Game Pass subscription. The Xbox app on Android doesn’t let you download or play any games you own through Game Pass or otherwise, but you can still access Game Pass Ultimate’s game streaming. Currently, fellow game shops, such as Steam and PlayStation Store, allow users to buy games directly through their mobile apps, and neither app requires users to go through Play Store billing. On Monday, Donato’s final ruling in Epic v. Google that the Mountain View tech giant could no longer force third-party app stores to use Google Play Billing. Google has already appealed the decision, and it is asking the court for a pause on the requested changes to Android’s ecosystem while that appeal is ongoing. Otherwise, Google has until Nov. 3 to make the necessary changes to Play Store and Android. Late last year, a jury already declared Google’s Play Store an illegal monopoly, setting up the dominos for what could become the biggest shakeup in the search giant’s software empire. The court restricted Google from putting up any roadblocks or throwing money at competing third-party app stores for the next three years. With part of Google’s business officially declared a monopoly, the feds are already imagining ways to break the Search giant into smaller, more manageable pieces. The Department of Justice proposed a plan on Tuesday that would end Google Search dominance on Android, essentially splitting off Google’s Chrome and Android businesses. In response, Google said the proposal would hurt user privacy if they’re forced to share search queries, clicks, and results with competitors. That’s ignoring how it already concerns Google, which has all that data in the first place. \nEpic GamesGoogleGoogle PlayMicrosoftXbox  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          You can say goodbye to the dreaded \"🥲 to 'why the hell aren’t emoji reacts working?’” from iOS to Android with RCS.\n         \n          Google accidentally leaked its AI agent on the Chrome extension store but quickly removed it.

            "content": "Let’s say you want to make a long-shot run for Congress as an independent in a deeply Democratic district of Virginia, but the incumbent in the race won’t give you airtime to debate your respective platforms in front of voters. You could simply run social media ads promoting your candidacy, or maybe present your case through a YouTube video in which you argue why you’re a better choice. Maybe contact the local newspaper to try and get an interview?  Or you could just use generative AI that’s been trained on the incumbent’s backlog of public comments and published material.  That’s what Bentley Hensel intends to do in Virginia’s 8th congressional district, where he’s running as an independent challenger against Don Beyer, who has brushed off requests to do another debate, saying a September forum was sufficient. Beyer won the district in 2022 by nearly two-thirds, so it’s not hard to see why he would feel it better to just ignore his relatively unknown challenger. It may be hard for some to suspend disbelief listening to a simulacrum of a real person. But ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode is so uncanny in its ability to speak in a natural and expressive way that it’s hard to even distinguish it from a real person. And companies like Character.ai and Replika are wildly popular for offering chatbots as forms of companionship. It’s not crazy to believe that voters, especially older ones, would be lulled into feeling they’re watching a genuine debate.  Hensel told Reuters that DonBot, as the bot is called, is being trained using ChatGPT’s API on Beyer’s official websites, press releases, and data from the Federal Election Commission. The bot is intended to provide accurate answers, though that’s not exactly reassuring to anyone who has actually used a chatbot before.  And sure enough, Reuters tested DonBot and found that although it largely provided straightforward answers to policy questions, it erred in saying Beyer has not endorsed anyone for president when he has in fact endorsed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Still, having been trained on a narrow data set, the bot is less likely to produce wild hallucinations.  Beyer did not tell Reuters whether or not he’ll take action to stop the online debate, taking place on October 17, but a spokesperson told the outlet that Beyer “continues to be a leading voice in Congress on the need to improve artificial intelligence regulation, including legislation to prevent nefarious actors from utilizing AI to spread election misinformation.” So, it sounds like he’s not exactly enthused.  Legal experts who spoke with Reuters said that the use of the bot is likely permissible so long as Hensel offers clear disclosure that he’s not actually speaking to the real Don Beyer. For Hensel, the attention he’s getting from creating the bot alone has probably been worth a lot. It seems slippery, however, if older voters and others come to wrongly believe a bot that is likely going to make some mistakes genuinely represents a candidate. We know it’s already easy enough for older generations to fall for AI-generated imagery.  At least 26 states have moved to take action regulating the use of generative AI in communications around elections, some going as far as to outright ban deepfakes of politicians. At the federal level, there has been, unsurprisingly, little movement.   \nArtificial intelligenceDeepfakes  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Conversational search will understand memory and context so you can talk to it like a person.\n         \n          Notepad is getting AI features that Microsoft claims will help you improve your writing.\n         \n          Google accidentally leaked its AI agent on the Chrome extension store but quickly removed it.

            "content": "Ozempic and similar drugs are having a cultural moment right now, but it appears that plenty of people aren’t on board. National survey data released this week suggests that a majority of Americans aren’t interested in taking these drugs, even if they are looking to lose weight. The development of Ozempic and other GLP-1 drugs has dramatically changed the landscape of obesity treatment in recent years, offering doctors medications that are far more effective at helping people lose weight than diet and exercise alone. The high demand from potential patients has led to shortages of these drugs, however, which has helped fueled a lucrative black and gray market for them. But these new findings indicate that Americans overall are still wary about these drugs, at least on a personal level. The polling firm Morning Consult conducted the survey, which was commissioned by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a nonprofit organization of doctors focused on promoting preventive medicine. The group has previously taken a strong stance against fast food chains and unhealthy menu options being allowed in hospitals. The poll involved a nationally representative sample of 2,205 adults who were asked if they agreed or disagreed with this statement: “If I wanted to lose weight, I would rather take an injectable weight–loss drug, rather than make a diet change.”  Overall, 23% agreed or strongly agreed with the sentiment, compared to 62% who disagreed or strongly disagreed, and 14% who said that they did not need to lose weight. When only including the people who might have wanted to lose weight, 73% disagreed with taking these drugs over making a change in diet. Conversely, a slight majority (57%) of participants said they would consider going on a plant-based diet, at least briefly, if it would cause significant weight loss. “The new findings do not mean that Americans do not want to lose weight; rather, most would prefer to change their eating habits than inject a medication,” said Neal Barnard, MD, president of the Physicians Committee, in a statement from the organization. ‘Gelzempic’ Could Make Popular Weight Loss Drugs Easier to Take Other research has shown that many people taking these drugs don’t take them for long. One study of real world use, for instance, found that only about 40% of people stayed on Ozempic for at least a year. Some of this reluctance to take or stay on these drugs may be due to the common gastrointestinal side-effects that they tend to cause, such as diarrhea or vomiting. But there are likely other factors involved as well. These drugs often aren’t covered by insurance companies and can cost upwards of $1,000 a month without coverage. Recent survey data elsewhere suggests that about 12% of Americans have taken a GLP-1 drug, and about half of these users (54%) reported having trouble affording them. While these drugs might not be for everyone, their still widespread use could be helping down drive obesity. According to CDC data released last month, the rate of adult obesity (defined as having a body mass index over 30) in the U.S. has finally stopped rising as of late for the first time in about a decade—a pattern break that at least some experts have attributed to the arrival of newer GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic. \nGLP-1OzempicSurveys  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          A GIMPS survey has discovered a prime number with over 41 million digits, surpassing the previous record-holder by more than 16 million digits.\n         \n          New research estimates that expanded access to Ozempic and similar drugs could lead to 42,000 deaths prevented annually.\n         \n          Research from earlier this week is the latest to suggest that semaglutide and other GLP-1 drugs can help treat people's addiction to both opioids and alcohol. \n         \n          New research suggests GLP-1 medications can blunt people's cravings for potentially addictive substances like opioids.\n         \n          The rate of adult obesity has finally stopped climbing in recent years, new CDC data shows.\n         \n          Few medications have become as popular and culturally relevant as Ozempic has, but how exactly do it and similar drugs affect our body?

            "content": "On Sunday night, billionaire Elon Musk did two pathetic little Dean Screams for a crowd of MAGA voters in Madison Square Garden. On Monday morning, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner filed a lawsuit to stop Musk’s $1 million giveaway to registered voters in America’s swing states. The Philadelphia Inquirer broke the story. DA Krasner filed the lawsuit in the Philadelphia Common Pleas Court. Through Musk’s America PAC, he’s been giving out $1 million a day to registered voters in swing states who sign a petition endorsing free speech and the Second Amendment. According to the Inquirer, the PAC has given away more than $9 million so far. Half of it has gone to voters in Pennsylvania. Musk’s petition and the $1 million giveaway are not contingent on the recipients voting for Trump, but it’s very clear which candidate the billionaire is endorsing. And legal scholars and the Justice Department have both warned Musk that his scheme may be illegal. The lawsuit in Philadelphia represents the first official legal challenge against the lottery. It may not be the last. Elon Musk: pic.twitter.com/vbFqUyrxZb — Acyn (@Acyn) October 27, 2024  “America PAC and Musk must be stopped, immediately, before the upcoming Presidential Election on Nov. 5,” the lawsuit says, according to the Inquirer. “That is because America PAC and Musk hatched their illegal lottery scheme to influence voters in that election.” Musk wants to be the Mr Beast of politics but, somehow, he has even less personal charisma than the grinning YouTuber. On Sunday, the Trump campaign hosted an “America First” rally at Madison Square Garden that featured overt racism and thinly veiled hints at how team MAGA would contest the election if they lost. Musk was on hand to introduce Melania. When he strutted on stage to introduce the first lady, he called attention to his black MAGA hat written in a Blackletter-style font. “I’m not just MAGA,” he said. “I’m dark, gothic MAGA.” Musk grinned as the crowd cheered him. He loved the adulation and gave out a few less-than-barbaric yawps for those in attendance. Seemingly unable to pull in a full breath from his diaphragm, the tech mogul who plans to colonize Mars burbled a pathetic yell at the audience while invoking a Fortnite emote. As the billionaire yipped on Sunday night, dark clouds gathered around him. On Friday, the Wall Street Journal broke the news that he’s had private conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin dating back to 2022. Musk, who has a bunch of government contracts, is a clear national security threat. The Krasner lawsuit is yet another hole in Musk’s leaky empire. Of course, none of it may matter if Trump wins.

            "content": "Elon Musk unveiled Tesla’s autonomous robotaxi, now known as the Cybercab, at the Warner Bros. studio in Burbank, California on Thursday night. And stop me if you’ve heard this one before, but the billionaire Tesla CEO says it’s coming in two or three years. The Cybercabs are two-seater vehicles with no steering wheel or pedals, and Musk billed them as “individualized mass transit.” Musk promised inductive charging, meaning the vehicle won’t need to be plugged in like a traditional electric car, but didn’t provide any details on how that would work. Musk started the highly anticipated show by walking out of a Warner Bros. studio building into a Cybercab that drove him to the audience. It made for quite a splashy presentation, complete with the glitz and glitter of Hollywood, and Musk is nothing if not a showman. The only question is whether he can actually deliver something he’s been promising is just “two years away” every year for the past decade. A concept video for the vehicle was playing behind the Tesla CEO as he was speaking on stage and he claimed “we expect the cost to be below $30,000,” to a large swell of cheers from the audience. But it wasn’t long after naming the price that he was interrupted by someone in the crowd who shouted out to ask when the Cybercabs were going to be available for purchase. “We do expect actually to start fully autonomous, unsupervised FSD in Texas and California next year,” Musk said to even more cheers. But then Musk finished his sentence, making it clear he was just talking about the existing Teslas on the road that would presumably need local government permission to operate without drivers. “And that’s obviously… that’s with the Model 3 and Model Y. And then we expect to be in production with the Cybercab, which is really highly optimized for autonomous transport, in probably… well, I tend to be a little optimistic with time frames, but in 2026,” Musk said stammering with a laugh. “So, yeah. Before 2027, let me put it that way. And we’ll make this vehicle in very high volume,” Musk claimed, to a much more subdued crowd response. Amusingly, some of the graphics playing behind Musk still called the vehicle a “robotaxi,” and whoever’s running the X account for Tesla also didn’t get the memo that they’re called Cybercabs now, not robotaxis: Robotaxi is premium point-to-point electric transport, accessible to everyone pic.twitter.com/oLykwaaTHm — Tesla (@Tesla) October 11, 2024  Twenty of the Cybercabs were available for special guests to try out at Thursday night’s event in Burbank. Musk predicted that autonomous cars would become ten times safer than human-driven cars and a big selling point is the idea that people who buy Cybercabs would be able to rent them out when the owner isn’t using them like a driverless Uber. Notably, Musk didn’t say that Tesla was pursuing the regulatory approvals needed for any of the things he was mentioning. And as we’ve seen with other companies, that’s a huge hurdle. Musk also showed off a Robovan, with a sleek futuristic style, but didn’t give any indication when that might be a reality. “We’re going to make this. And it’s going to look like that,” Musk insisted, with a tone betraying the fact that he perhaps didn’t even believe it himself. The Robovan will supposedly fit 20 people (four more people than the futuristic Loop vehicles he promised and never delivered on back in the 2010s). Robovan details pic.twitter.com/Pdito0dfRq — Tesla (@Tesla) October 11, 2024  The billionaire CEO also showed off the Optimus robot, which he says will mow your lawn, get your groceries, and watch your kids. Musk said he thought Optimus would be “the biggest product ever of any kind.” Musk claimed the robot would cost “$20-30,000 long-term,” but didn’t give details we hadn’t heard before. Many experts are skeptical that Musk could meet that price point if he gets Optimus into mass production. But the robots were on hand during the event, supposedly mixing drinks for guests, though it’s not clear how “autonomous” the robots were in reality. Musk has tried that sleight-of-hand before, with a human operator controlling things just out of frame. Optimus is your personal R2D2 / C3PO, but better It will also transform physical labor in industrial settings pic.twitter.com/iCET3a9pd8 — Tesla (@Tesla) October 11, 2024  The event was titled “We, Robot” and livestreamed on YouTube, but it’s likely to be a huge disappointment to many people who were hopeful that Musk would promise something that was actually coming soon. CNBC’s Squawk on the Street asked a bullish analyst on Thursday morning whether we’d get any info on cost per mile, scaling the cybercab, a ridesharing app, or insurance costs. We didn’t hear anything even approximating those kinds of details on Thursday. Companies are already doing driverless taxis out in the real world. Alphabet’s Waymo is operating in markets like Los Angeles and San Francisco. GM’s Cruise operates in Phoenix, Dallas, and Houston and recently announced the company will be launching a partnership with Uber in 2025. Cruise temporarily suspended operations in California after an incident in October 2023 where a self-driving vehicle hit and dragged a pedestrian who was jaywalking in San Francisco, but resumed in three cities in June 2024. Musk has become a lightning rod of controversy over recent years, buying Twitter in 2022 and turning it into a hotbed of far-right extremism and conspiracy theories. Musk also came out as a Republican in 2022, coincidentally just a day before an unflattering Business Insider story alleging he offered to buy a flight attendant a horse in exchange for sexual favors. The billionaire denied that story. The American oligarch has fully embraced Trumpism, despite previously calling Trump too old to run again, and has even started a Super PAC that’s trying to get the neo-fascist former president back into the White House. But Trump may not be the good friend in business that Musk is hoping for, if Trump’s own words can be believed. Trump gave a speech in Detroit on Thursday where he rambled about a number of topics, even touching on autonomous vehicles, which he doesn’t like. “Chinese and other countries produced automobile and autonomous vehicles,” Trump said. “Do you like autonomous? Does anybody like an autonomous vehicle? You know what that is, right? When you see a car driving along.” “Some people do, I don’t know,” Trump continued. “A little concerning to me, but the autonomous vehicles, we’re going to stop from operating on American roads.” TRUMP: \"Other countries produced auto-mo–bile and autonomous vehicles. Do you like autonomous? Does anybody like an autonomous vehicle? You know what that is, right?\" CROWD: *one person claps* pic.twitter.com/68y8nP5sIl — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 10, 2024  But who knows if Musk can deliver on the things he promised on Thursday. We’ve heard all of this before in some version or another. Musk has been saying for years that fully autonomous vehicles will be delivered so very soon. Someone even created a video a couple of years ago collecting all his promises since 2014. “In 2020, we expect to have a million robotaxis on the road,” Musk said on an earnings call in 2019, as just one example. Nobody knows what the future holds, and Musk does have a habit of delivering products very late. But there are certainly times when his promises simply didn’t happen or the finished product was so unlike what he promised that it’s just downright comical. Do you remember the 16-person vehicles he was promising various municipalities like Chicago and Las Vegas? Musk called it The Loop, not to be confused with the Hyperloop. The Boring Company was going to build it and transport passengers in a tunnel covering the 18 miles between downtown Chicago and O’Hare Airport. The whole ride would take about 12 minutes, according to Musk, and it looked pretty futuristic, as you can see in a portion of the concept video below. That video has since been scrubbed from the internet. Musk never delivered on a futuristic version of The Loop for Chicago or any other city. Instead, he built a tunnel in Las Vegas with human drivers who are operating normal Teslas at slow speeds. It was very disappointing, to say the least. What are the odds that Musk’s new Cybercab becomes The Loop? We don’t know. But that two or three-year timeframe doesn’t make us very optimistic about the Cybercab’s future. \nCybercabRobotaxirobotaxisRobotsrobovanTESLA  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Yes, it’s named after the 2015 sci-fi movie.\n         \n          Private prisons, crypto, banks, and the stock-market in general are all soaring at the news of Trump’s return to the White House.\n         \n          Read the complaints filed with the FTC about scams that use Elon Musk's face.\n         \n          What happens when a fascist billionaire makes something you like?\n         \n          Xiaomi's SU7 looks like a Porsche, starts at just $30,000, and is selling like hotcakes in China.\n         \n          It looks slick, but it's still light on details.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Love it or hate it, AI is blooming in offices across the world. Unless those offices are full of employees working for the U.S. federal government. A new report from Fedscoop casts doubt on Washington’s ability to keep up with the times. According to its analysis of multiple federal agencies, D.C. doesn’t have the funds or the talent to train to keep up with AI. Last year, President Joe Biden watched Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One and got freaked out about AI. It scared him so bad that he signed an executive order that called on tech companies to develop the tech responsibly. The White House also called on federal agencies to issue reports that would detail how they plan to use AI, their plans to mitigate risks against humanity, and to elaborate on what barriers stood in the way of mass adoption of AI. The White House wanted these reports posted publicly by September. Most of the federal agencies replied and Fedscoop has collected them all in one place and found a common theme. According to Fedscoop, twenty-nine agencies submitted reports. A dozen of them mentioned data hurdles, six mentioned a lack of AI-trained employees, and six said that a lack of funding was hurting their AI initiatives. The Department of Energy, which is in charge of the nation’s nuclear arsenal, complained that understandable security concerns around cloud services are preventing it from ramping up its adoption of AI. It also doesn’t have enough graphics cards. “The IT infrastructure barrier extends beyond the serverless CSP services to the availability and timeliness of securing virtual machines with the requisite Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) hardware to develop, train, manage, and deploy advanced AI models,” a DOE report on its adoption of AI said. “This challenge is industry-wide; however, it will impact the rollout and adoption of more advanced customized use cases that require dedicated GPU hardware.” The recurring data problem is a big one. Many of these federal agencies have been around for decades. People drift in and out, some sticking around for years and others cycling in and out with each new presidential administration. Many of the technological systems at these agencies are ad-hoc in nature. Things get replaced when they absolutely have to be, but not before. A great example of this is America’s nuclear weapons systems. The Air Force used enormous eight-inch floppy discs to run the software governing nuclear command and control until 2019. When Colin Powell became Secretary of State under George W. Bush in 2001, he discovered that his office was full of pre-internet era computers designed by a company that had gone bankrupt in 1992. The mass adoption of AI is forcing D.C. to face similar technology challenges all at once across all its departments. The data problem, repeated over a dozen reports, is a reflection of this ad-hoc build-up. Training internal LLMs for government use requires data to be centralized and secure. In many of these agencies, data is distributed in hundreds of different places and few off-the-shelf solutions are secure enough for government work. Another theme was a lack of understanding of AI in the workforce and an outright fear of it. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which deals with nuclear power plants and radioactive materials, said its workforce was interested but “it has also expressed trepidation as well as a general lack of knowledge of AI capabilities. To address this, the agency must continue to enable effective change management to enable the workforce to take full advantage of AI capabilities as they are introduced.” Many of the agencies also complained about funding. The NRC said it was “only able to assess, test, implement, and maintain new capabilities where resources have been made available to do so.” “AI use cases compete for funding and staffing with other important priorities at the Bank including non-IT investments in core EXIM capabilities, cyber security, and other use cases in our modernization agenda,” the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. said in its report. It’s going to be expensive and time-consuming for these agencies to catch up with the rest of the country. Back in 2001, Powell had to buy everyone in his office a computer, 44,000 machines to hear him tell it. “Don’t ask me how I got the money, because I won’t tell you,” he said at an IT symposium in 2019. \nAiLLM  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Identifying when animals are in pain is good for moral reasons, of course, but also for maximizing their productivity.\n         \n          Conversational search will understand memory and context so you can talk to it like a person.\n         \n          Palantir and Anthropic have signed a deal to bring Claude to the Pentagon.\n         \n          Older models struggled with depth issues in 2D images, but the novel neural network handles these problems with ease.\n         \n          Thousand of Dublin residents were misled by an AI chum website promoting events that aren't real.\n         \n          China’s People’s Liberation Army is using Llama 13B for military applications.

            "content": "On What We Do in the Shadows, Nandor is probably the goofiest of the vampires—even if he doesn’t realize it, since he has a complete lack of self-awareness at all times. io9 got a chance to talk to Kayvan Novak about what’s in store for season six, including Nandor’s ever-conflicted relationship with his former familiar, Guillermo (Harvey Guillén), and an episode where he briefly thinks he’s an infamous former American president. Cheryl Eddy, io9: Did you already do a Richard Nixon impression or did you have to develop that for the show? Kayvan Novak: I didn’t. I was aware of Richard Nixon, but I guess the movie Good Morning Vietnam was really [where I got most of my awareness] of him and his character and people making fun of him. Robin Williams does an impression of him and he cuts that interview up to make him sound ridiculous. But I was given many YouTube videos of Richard Nixon to study and I didn’t do any of it. I just turned up on the day and did an impression. I did a little bit of homework. I was apprehensive. I was nervous. To be honest, it didn’t make sense as to why Nandor would be able to do a Richard Nixon impression even if he’d been hypnotized. But no one listens to me. So I just went and did it anyway. io9: Nandor has a crisis when Jerry, the long-slumbering roommate who makes a sudden return, points out how far he’s fallen from being “Nandor the Relentless.” What do you think happened over those 50 years to make his personality shift so much? Was it Jerry’s absence or something else? Novak: I guess living in Staten Island, doing less pillaging and massacring, probably has softened his edges a little bit, you know, thinking maybe there’s something else that he is missing in his life. The influence of Guillermo probably made him see things a different way because he secretly cares about this familiar, this human being, that he kind of pretends he doesn’t care about. I think 700 years of life would do that to someone. io9: I’m glad you mentioned Guillermo, because he and Nandor (“Nandermo” to shippers) are in an odd place when the season begins. As we see, Guillermo has tried to set some new boundaries. How would you describe Nandor’s headspace about where they’re at after the events of season five? Novak: [Guillermo] doesn’t really need Nandor anymore because he doesn’t want to be a vampire anymore. That was Nandor’s leverage on him, and now that’s gone. Nandor’s kind of been dumped, really—and I think without letting on that he gives a shit, he clearly gives a shit and acts accordingly. So really that’s his motivation, I’d say, is kind of fucking with Guillermo, even though Guillermo doesn’t really want anything to do with him. io9: Nandor and Nadja have had this running competition between them throughout the show—they both see themselves as having more authority than the other. What do you think were the origins of that? Novak: It feels like a sibling rivalry, to be honest. When I’m doing those scenes, it’s like I’m bickering with my sister; it’s got that kind of vibe to it. I like that. There’s a kind of disrespect and a disdain that we both have for each other, but we still kind of want to achieve our goal together, you know? I really enjoyed that actually, because we kind of hinted on that in previous seasons, but this season, the vibe felt really high energy and farcical with me and Natasia [Demetriou, who plays Nadja]. I did really enjoy that. io9: What character trait about Nandor would you say you enjoy the most, or that you enjoyed playing the most? Novak: Indecisiveness—in a world where making decisions is important. And when [Nandor] did [make a decision], making the wrong decisions is always a joy to play. A real holiday from being a grown up. io9: Did you keep anything from the set? Novak: I grabbed the portrait of Nandor from the opening credits. io9: Nice. You have it hanging in your house? Novak: I do. What We Do in the Shadows season six premieres October 21 with the first three episodes on FX; you can stream them the next day on Hulu. Want more io9 news?

            "content": "Elon Musk has been campaigning hard for Donald Trump, in an effort to get his fellow billionaire re-elected President. A big part of Musk’s political strategy thus far has been to rile up conservative voter blocs with rightwing, anti-Democrat conspiracy theories and misinformation. During a campaign event in the pivotal swing state of Pennsylvania, Musk recently gestured at a well-known (and, as some former Trump compatriots have discovered, highly libelous) conspiracy theory: that the use of voting machines sold by Dominion Voting Systems is, somehow, a questionable idea. Apparently not deterred by the fact that the last people who accused the electioneering company of wrongdoing found themselves in a years-long litigation battle that ended in a $787 million payout, Musk waded cautiously into dangerous rhetorical waters during a town hall-style event in Folsom, Pennsylvania on Thursday. When asked by an audience member about the issue of voter fraud, Musk took a brief detour into his favorite place: conspiracy-land. “When you have mail-in ballots and no proof of citizenship, it’s almost impossible to prove cheating,” Musk said, in response to the audience member’s question. He then added: “Statistically there are some very strange things that happen that are statistically incredibly unlikely. There’s always this question of, say, the Dominion voting machines. It is weird that, I think, they were used in Philadelphia and in Maricopa County [in Arizona] but not in a lot of other places. Doesn’t that seem like a heck of a coincidence?” Careful, Elon, careful. I think your life’s already complicated enough without yet another titanic legal battle on your hands. Musk has used his recently purchased web platform, X (formerly Twitter), to push absurd rightwing conspiracy theories, many of which have linked the Democrats to plots to use illegal immigrants to commit mass voter fraud. In general, Musk has seemed pretty undiscerning with the kinds of claims he makes (he recently claimed, for instance, that, instead of helping hurricane Helene victims, FEMA had “used up its budget ferrying illegals into the country,” a fictional act that Musk dubbed “Treason” ). That said, the billionaire also appears to have learned that when it comes to Dominion Voting Systems, it’s better to err on the side of ambiguity rather than make any statements that could get yourself sued into oblivion. Saying that the use of Dominion voting machines is “weird” isn’t exactly what Rudy Giuliani said. When reached for comment by Gizmodo, a Dominion Voting Systems spokesperson provided the following response to Musk’s comments: “Fact: Dominion does not serve Philadelphia County. Fact: Dominion’s voting systems are already based on voter verified paper ballots. Fact: Hand counts and audits of such paper ballots have repeatedly proven that Dominion machines produce accurate results. These are not matters of opinion. They are verifiable facts.” Gizmodo reached out to Musk via Tesla for clarification on his comments. We will update this story if he responds. Musk has involved himself in the U.S. electoral process in a fashion that is basically unprecedented in modern history. The tech billionaire is credited with running Trump’s ground game in major swing states, and has leveraged tens of millions of dollars to do so. He has poured money into a variety of different pro-Trump groups, the likes of which have resorted to increasingly unconventional campaign strategies to generate voters. On Friday, for instance, news broke that a Musk-linked PAC was micro-targeting Muslim and Jewish voters in Michigan and Pennsylvania with contradictory political ads (the ads targeting the Muslim voters allegedly claimed Harris was close with Israel, while the ads targeting Jewish voters claimed she was anti-Semitic). Another Musk-funded group reportedly created what has been dubbed a “fake pro-Harris” campaign website which highlights “disproven and misleading claims about Harris’ positions.” On top of all of this, Musk has recently resorted to paying voters to sign political petitions, in a practice that has election law experts raising their eyebrows. \nDominionDonald TrumpElon Musk  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Just like in 2016, Donald Trump benefited from having a loud propagandist with access to an influential media bullhorn.\n         \n          Racists have become emboldened on the internet after Donald Trump's election win.\n         \n          OpenAI is going through a rough patch and it's Elon's turn to take revenge.\n         \n          Kevin Rudd called Trump \"the most destructive president in history\" during his Bible-holding photo-op in 2020.\n         \n          Donald Trump's victory was a bat-signal for Silicon Valley oligarchs.\n         \n          With control of the White House and the Senate, Republicans are poised to upend U.S. climate policy.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

And all of the chatter has caused people to become very suspicious about why this is suddenly popping up now. “BREAKING: THE REGIME IS PRESSING THE DESPERATION BUTTON DEEPFAKES IMMINENT STAY FROSTY,” Jack Posobiec wrote on X Wednesday, referring to the Joe Biden administration, which he calls “the regime.”  Posobiec is the pro-Trump influencer with “extensive ties to white supremacists,” in the words of the Southern Poverty Law Center, who first made his name online by promoting the Pizzagate conspiracy theory. But it’s not just Posobiec who’s warning social media consumers about supposed deepfakes on the horizon. Charlie Kirk, the leader of the pro-Trump group Talking Points USA, also sent out a warning on social media. “You are about to see insanely desperate stuff from Democrats. Expect fake AI generated crap about Trump coming soon. Stay focused AND VOTE!” Kirk wrote on X Tuesday.  You are about to see insanely desperate stuff from Democrats. Expect fake AI generated crap about Trump coming soon. Stay focused AND VOTE! — Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) October 23, 2024  Trump has a history of calling very real videos and images deepfakes, or “clean-fakes” as he once dubbed them. Back in Dec. 2023 the conservative anti-Trump advocacy group The Lincoln Project released a video of several times when Trump misspoke or otherwise looked like an idiot. The video included an infamous shot of the former president staring at an eclipse from the White House, really struggling with the word “anonymous” in 2018, and calling the town of Paradise, California, “Pleasure,” among other lowlights. But Trump insisted the video was created with AI, despite the fact that every single clip in there was unaltered. “The perverts and losers at the failed and once disbanded Lincoln Project, and others, are using A.l. (Artificial Intelligence) in their Fake television commercials in order to make me look as bad and pathetic as Crooked Joe Biden, not an easy thing to do,” Trump wrote on Truth Social at the time. This past September Trump also claimed that a photo of him with E. Jean Carroll, the woman he sexually assaulted in the 1990s and to whom he lost a court case after lying about it, might have been made with artificial intelligence. The photo was not made with AI. Here is Trump falsely claiming that a photo of himself alongside E Jean Carroll could “be AI.” This was said at his “press conference” where he announced his legal team will appeal his rape conviction. Donald Trump is a rapist. pic.twitter.com/1Hv5ndfPRQ — DARKO POLITICS (@darkopolitics) September 6, 2024  There was plenty of talk online about the fact that Trump supporters were freaking out about deepfakes this week, with many people speculating that it’s either the video of Trump allegedly saying the n-word on the set of his TV show “The Apprentice” or that “pee tape” referenced in the Steele Dossier. “As someone who thinks the pee tape is real and exists, I just want to put a marker down that a last minute ‘damning’ Trump video is like 100x more likely to be him saying the n-word on the set of the apprentice, something we already know for certain a tape at one point existed of,” Michael Tae Sweeney wrote on Bluesky. Journalist Mark Halperin has suggested this week that he’s been pitched something fake, though didn’t specifically say if he believes it’s just a fake story or if there is some element of AI involved. “I know of one story that’s been pitched to a major newspaper and to me, and for all I know to many others, that I don’t believe is true,” Halperin said in a video published on Wednesday. “But if it’s true, as I said yesterday, it would end Donald Trump’s campaign, just as if the accusations now thoroughly debunked and attributed by American intelligence to Russia about Tim Walz.” Walz was the target of a recent disinformation campaign that accused him of sexually assaulting a student, using either an actor or an AI face to make the untrue allegations. In another video, Halperin said the last two weeks of the election cycle will be “filled with things like this.” Journalist Mark Halperin: “I’ve been pitched a story about Donald Trump for about a week that if true, it would end his campaign.” Why’s the media sitting on it?pic.twitter.com/lfEttMCVAy — Art Candee 🍿🥤 (@ArtCandee) October 23, 2024  Nobody knows for sure what might be coming, obviously. It might just be a coincidence that multiple right-wing influencers are warning about potential deepfakes to harm Trump. But it’s wild to think about what could be arriving with less than two weeks until Election Day, especially since Trump’s former chief of staff John Kelly told The Atlantic and the New York Times on Monday that Trump is a fascist who repeatedly talked about his admiration for Adolf Hitler’s generals during World War II. It’s entirely possible that a video of Trump talking about Hitler could be released soon. But even if it does, don’t get your hopes up that Trump will lose the election because of it. If we’ve learned anything about Trump supporters, it’s that no amount of evidence will dissuade them from voting for that convicted felon. It’s either “fake news” or they insist it’s completely reasonable for Trump to say he wants generals like Hitler. \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Identifying when animals are in pain is good for moral reasons, of course, but also for maximizing their productivity.\n         \n          Just like in 2016, Donald Trump benefited from having a loud propagandist with access to an influential media bullhorn.\n         \n          Racists have become emboldened on the internet after Donald Trump's election win.\n         \n          OpenAI is going through a rough patch and it's Elon's turn to take revenge.\n         \n          Conversational search will understand memory and context so you can talk to it like a person.\n         \n          Kevin Rudd called Trump \"the most destructive president in history\" during his Bible-holding photo-op in 2020.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Top economists and assorted financial experts have been sounding the alarm that Donald Trump’s plans for a second presidential term could spike the federal deficit by trillions of dollars, worsen inflation, and, eventually, send the U.S. economy screaming toward a recession (if not an outright depression). Weirdly enough, it appears that Trump’s top campaign operative, Elon Musk, agrees that the candidate’s policies could damage the economy. For the second time in a week, Musk has weirdly implied that Trump will bring economic “hardship” to America, a claim that would be funny if it didn’t seem so likely. The first instance came during a “Telephone Town Hall” hosted on the tech billionaire’s website X, during which Musk said, cryptically: “We have to reduce spending to live within our means. And that necessarily involves some temporary hardship, but it will ensure long-term prosperity.” Musk, who was talking about reducing the national debt when he made the comments, didn’t elaborate on what he was referring to. If that may have spooked some voters, Musk did nothing to assuage their fears when, on Monday, the tech billionaire again seemed to affirm a vision of coming adversity for Americans. Musk did this by replying to a rightwing account on X, the likes of which had written a screed about a coming economic “tumble”: If Trump succeeds in forcing through mass deportations, combined with Elon hacking away at the government, As crazy as it sounds, firing people and reducing the deficit – there will be an initial severe overreaction in the economy – this economy propped up with debt (generating asset bubbles) and artificially suppressed wages (as a result of illegal immigration). Markets will tumble. But when the storm passes and everyone realizes we are on sounder footing, there will be a rapid recovery to a healthier, sustainable economy. History could be made in the coming two years. Musk replied: “sounds about right.” Plenty of economists have warned that Trump’s plans could spell disaster for the U.S. economy. His plans to deport millions of illegal immigrants, give huge tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, weaken the U.S. dollar, and institute global tariffs, have all been referred to as terrible ideas that could drive up the federal deficit, spur inflation, and cause chaos. Trump advisors’ have espoused plans—like making huge cuts to federal spending and firing tens of thousands of government workers—that would surely spur more chaos. That said, it is thoroughly bizarre to see Musk—a key Trump ally—admit this, whilst in the middle of one of the tightest presidential races in modern history. Why would Musk do this? It seems notable that one of Musk’s heroes is the current president of Argentina, Javier Milei, who has been credited with taking a “chainsaw” to the nation’s government. Milei, an avowed “free market,” “anti-woke” libertarian, took office in December of 2023, and has instituted what he calls an “austerity” budget, characterized by economic “shock treatment.” This strategy has involved making deep cuts to government spending on social welfare programs, devaluing the peso, and cutting thousands of government jobs, all in the hope of some vague libertarian glowup in the near to far future. The parallels between Milei’s government and the plans espoused by Trump’s allies are worth considering. While the U.S. and Argentina are two very different countries, the ideology animating Milei’s transformation of his government, and the ideology fueling many of Trump’s advisors is essentially the same. ProPublica recently revealed the espoused goals of powerful Trump advisor, and rightwing libertarian, Russell Vought, who is said to be a key figure in Project 2025, the anti-government effort promulgated by the Heritage Foundation. Vought has similarly said that he wants to drastically reorganize the federal government and put career civil servants “in trauma.” Musk, himself, has advocated for a “Government Efficiency” task force, the likes of which would “audit” public agencies to look for inefficiencies. Like Milei’s strategy, Trump advisors see a leaner, stripped-down bureaucracy as the key to long-term national wealth. That said, Argentina under Milei does not seem to be seeing a whole lot of wealth. In the first six months of his presidency, the nation’s poverty rates spiked by 10 percent and, last year, its inflation rate soared to 211 percent, the highest it had been in 32 years. Rates of homelessness and job loss have been seen to increase. Many Argentinians have been literally “scavenging” dumpsters to survive, Reuters reported in March. Inflation in the country is now slowing, but only after climbing to the highest rate in the world. When Milei took office last December, his comment, much like Musk’s, was: “We know that in the short term the situation will worsen.” Mission accomplished, I guess. For whatever reason, Trump’s supporters view him as a competent and successful businessman and have fond memories of the economy under his presidency. Despite these widely held beliefs, lots of credible economic data suggest that Trump actually inherited a strong economy (the likes of which had been in a period of sustained recovery ever since the 2008 financial crisis) from the outgoing Obama administration and that Trump’s policies actually served to undermine that strong economy, not help it. Ironically, Trump’s economic plans seem designed to harm his voter base—a situation his voters clearly do not understand. For instance, Trump has claimed he wants to end taxes on Social Security. Voters at a rally recently cheered for this proposal, ostensibly because they don’t like taxes. However, Social Security only continues to exist thanks to taxes. Trump’s suggestion is tantamount to a bank telling a small business that it’s going to cut off its line of credit; the business would flounder and die. Ending taxes on SS would starve and ultimately bankrupt the program in a matter of years, leading to tens of millions of Americans being thrown into poverty. Conversely, Harris has announced plans to save the program by raising taxes on the top 1 percent of Americans. The silver lining to all of this is that should Trump win the presidency and should he try to cram through many of his team’s screwball, rightwing economic proposals, he would obviously need the approval of Congress to pass them. It is unlikely that he would receive such approval. That said, the very fact that such harmful policies are being floated is scary enough. \nDonald TrumpElon Musk  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Just like in 2016, Donald Trump benefited from having a loud propagandist with access to an influential media bullhorn.\n         \n          Racists have become emboldened on the internet after Donald Trump's election win.\n         \n          OpenAI is going through a rough patch and it's Elon's turn to take revenge.\n         \n          Kevin Rudd called Trump \"the most destructive president in history\" during his Bible-holding photo-op in 2020.\n         \n          Donald Trump's victory was a bat-signal for Silicon Valley oligarchs.\n         \n          With control of the White House and the Senate, Republicans are poised to upend U.S. climate policy.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Elon Musk was showered with praise on social media during his big robotaxi unveiling on Thursday, even if the Tesla CEO’s Cybercab is still just a prototype that may never get released. But it was Musk’s humanoid robots that arguably received the most attention in videos posted during the event, as Optimus bots were seen dancing, talking with guests, playing paper-rock-scissors, and even pouring drinks. There’s just one problem: The robots weren’t operating as autonomously as most people had initially assumed. The Optimus robots were under the control of unseen humans, according to one person who spoke with a Tesla engineer at the event, but Musk didn’t tell people that directly. “This is not wholly AI. A human is remote assisting,” tech evangelist Robert Scoble tweeted, along with a video from the event at Warner Bros. studios in Burbank on Thursday night. Optimus make me a drink, please. This is not wholly AI. A human is remote assisting. Which means AI day next year where we will see how fast Optimus is learning. pic.twitter.com/CE2bEA2uQD — Robert Scoble (@Scobleizer) October 11, 2024  Scoble was still clearly impressed with the robots. But it gave the entire spectacle a very different vibe when you know there are humans off in a room somewhere doing at least some of the work. We’ve had tele-operation of robots (sometimes called a Waldo) since at least the 1940s, though admittedly in a more primitive form. Walt Disney used teleoperation to achieve life-like robotics in the 1960s for his attractions at the World’s Fair and Disneyland. The big difference between Musk and Disney is that Disney wasn’t trying to use tele-ops to trick anyone. The entire purpose was to create a show, not unlike Musk’s goal Thursday night. The billionaire did stage everything at a movie studio, after all. But by not disclosing up front that his robots were getting human assistance, more than a few people on social media said they felt deceived. Musk is far from the first person to use smoke and mirrors to make robots look like they’re capable of amazing feats while actually being less than transparent about how the technology works. The Tesla CEO’s constant hype of products that don’t actually exist yet (remember the Optimus debut in 2021 that was just a human in a robot suit?) reminds me of RCA-Whirlpool’s so-called Miracle Kitchen from the late 1950s. Especially because the kitchen display had a robot that was actually being remote controlled by a human in the next room, despite telling viewers it was working by itself. The Miracle Kitchen was the crown jewel of the 1959 fair in Russia held during a very brief attempt at friendlier relations between the U.S. and Soviet Union during the Cold War. It was a kind of cultural exchange, with the Soviets putting on a tech fair in New York while the Americans put on a show in Moscow. You may even remember learning about the “kitchen debate” between then-Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Yep, that was the kitchen. The American National Exhibition had everything from a fashion show to films about life in the U.S. But it was the kitchen that really impressed people, as it seemingly showed off advanced technologies, including a central computer with push-button controls and an autonomous robot that looked like a proto-Roomba. But the Americans only said it was autonomous. Someone has uploaded a 13-minute promotional film for the kitchen to YouTube, but a one-minute clip about the vacuum is below to give you an idea of what the Russians saw back in 1959. “What you see coming out of the wall is a self-propelled floor cleaner. It’s completely self-contained and it can be directed to any part of the kitchen,” the film’s host says. “This floor cleaner is operated by a self-charging battery. It controls itself by sensing an electrical path in the floor,” the host continues. “As it passes over the floor, it vacuums up loose particles. And if the floor needs washing, the floor cleaner will wash it with a rotary brush scrubbing action. It will follow up washing with a thorough rinsing.” This incredible robot vacuum wasn’t just going to get all the floor-cleaning done, it was going to do it without being told to return for charging. “And when the entire job is done, the floor cleaner returns to its location beneath the cabinet where it empties the waste and is automatically recharged to be ready for the next operation,” the host claimed. In reality, the robot wasn’t working independently at all. Back in 2015, I spoke with a man named Joe Maxwell, then in his 80s, who helped design the kitchen back in the 1950s. Maxwell was working for the design firm Sundberg-Ferar in Detroit and gave me some behind-the-scenes info about the kitchen that had never been written about before. “They had a two-way mirror with a person sitting behind it that could see the room,” Maxwell told me over the phone. “And they radio-controlled the vacuum cleaner and the dishwasher.” “They said it was sniffing a wire in the floor, which it could have been,” Maxwell told me. “But it was easier just to have a person behind this mirror that could make all the things happen—from opening the doors and lowering the shelves and all of those different things.” Having someone just secretly sitting in the next room was much easier and less expensive than using advanced sensors. “It was easier to do that than to put in all of those sensors all over the place, and do what the push-button said to do. It was simpler just to have a person operating that stuff remotely,” said Maxwell. “That was for expediency more than it was for lack of technology.” Maxwell then paused to clarify. “But there was a lack of technology. We did not have anything near what we have today. We had computers, but they were big boxes.” You can see why Musk’s robot demonstration yesterday reminded me of this tech fair from the late 1950s. The goal of the Americans was to convince Soviets that U.S.-style capitalism was the superior system, delivering amazing consumer products that even included computers and advanced robotics. But it was all a show for propaganda purposes, assisted by the CIA and the Rand Corporation along with big business. Some investors called Thursday’s Tesla event “underwhelming” given its lack of specifics and ridiculously long time-frame for delivery of the Cybercab and Optimus robot. But Musk often does this schtick of hyping up tech that doesn’t exist yet. Then when people eventually come back to Earth and realize he hasn’t delivered anything impressive he finds another bright shiny object to shake in front of Wall Street. Remember the hyper-fast Loop that Musk was going to bring to cities like Chicago and Las Vegas? It was supposed to feature autonomous 16-passenger vehicles gliding along at 150 miles per hour. The billionaire eventually delivered regular Teslas operated by human drivers going 35 miles per hour in a tunnel under Las Vegas. At least we can say Musk’s robots aren’t shouting slurs. Well, not yet. \nElon MuskFakesHoaxRCARobotsTESLAWhirlpool  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Just like in 2016, Donald Trump benefited from having a loud propagandist with access to an influential media bullhorn.\n         \n          OpenAI is going through a rough patch and it's Elon's turn to take revenge.\n         \n          Yes, it’s named after the 2015 sci-fi movie.\n         \n          Private prisons, crypto, banks, and the stock-market in general are all soaring at the news of Trump’s return to the White House.\n         \n          America's wealthiest oligarch stands to benefit tremendously during a second Trump term.\n         \n          It feels like everything is on the line for the billionaire playboy.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Hurricane Milton made landfall with the eastern coast of Florida on Wednesday night as a Category 3 storm, wiping out power for about 3 million people and bringing devastating wind and rain. Tornadoes on the eastern coast of Florida caused their own damage to life and property, and the photos that are emerging in the light of day are devastating. At least 10 people have died from the storms so far, according to Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary of Homeland Security, who reported the death toll while calling in via video conference on Thursday afternoon at the White House daily press conference. Mayorkas was dialing in remotely from North Carolina, where he’s currently overseeing the recovery efforts from Hurricane Helene which has decimated the western portion of the state, an area of high altitude where the vast majority of people don’t have flood insurance. “Milton may have passed, but the danger it poses has not,” Mayorkas said. “Downed power lines, flood waters, non-potable drinking water, and debris are creating deadly conditions. Keep listening to local officials and shelter in place until it is safe, if told to do so. Only use generators when and where it is safe to do so. You can find more tips on staying safe after a storm on the FEMA app or by visiting ready.gov.” “Structures have been severely damaged or collapsed, and tragically, we know that lives have been lost. We are praying for them and their loved ones,” Mayorkas said at Thursday’s press conference. One of those damaged buildings is the Tampa Bay Times’s building in downtown St. Petersburg where a construction crane collapsed on the eight-story building, causing an enormous hole. Social media has been flooded with conspiracy theories about both Hurricane Milton and Hurricane Helene, including the idea that Democrats can control the weather and steered the hurricanes into predominantly Republican areas in an effort to help Donald Trump. In another era, that kind of nonsense would’ve been relegated to the fringes of society, but here in the 2020s it’s going viral on sites like X and being spread by sitting members of Congress. “Yes they can control the weather. It’s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can’t be done,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia tweeted last week in the first of what would be multiple tweets recently insisting there was a hurricane-control conspiracy going on. The internet has also been flooded with fake and mislabeled images purporting to be from Hurricane Milton, including ridiculous AI-generated photos that supposedly show Walt Disney World in Florida completely flooded. In reality, the theme park plans to reopen on Friday. Secretary Mayorkas addressed the disinformation in the White House press conference on Thursday, stressing that it does cause problems in the real world. “So let me repeat that, in fact, the false information that is being spread deliberately does have a real-life impact on survivors, and it is also demoralizing for those heroic individuals who are risking their lives in the service of others,” Mayorkas said.  Mayorkas even gave an example of how that information is hindering the rescue efforts on the ground. “There is false information that federal employees who are there to help people will actually take their land,” Mayorkas explained, “and what we have seen is people reticent, reluctant to access the relief to which they are entitled and which will help them because of the fear that that false information has instilled in them. That is just one example.” Residents of St. Petersburg,  Gulfport, South Pasadena, and Lealman are being told to boil water since so many water mains have broken. “Last night, the City made the difficult decision to shut off potable (drinking) water due to major water main breaks from Hurricane Milton,” St. Petersburg said in a statement posted to the city’s website. “Crews are making repairs and potable water is back on, though pressure may be low. Once the system is pressurized, water service should resume as normal. However, a citywide boil water notice has been issued for all water customers. This includes residents of St. Petersburg, Gulfport, South Pasadena, and Lealman.” The city of St. Petersburg notes that any non-bottled water intended for activities like drinking, brushing your teeth or cooking should be boiled first. “According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), use boiled or bottled water for drinking, cooking, brushing teeth, or cleaning during the boil water notice period. To boil water, bring water to a full rolling boil for 1 minute and allow the water to cool before use,” the city explained. Spectrum Internet has received over 8,000 reports of issues from internet users in the Hurricane Milton path, according to DownDetector, which sent Gizmodo a report Thursday afternoon. Issues with connecting to the internet were the top issue (35%), with total outages and a lack of signal representing 26% and 23% respectively, DownDetector reports. Thankfully, one of the bright spots in the aftermath of the storm is that Tampa and its enormous population have so far been spared deaths from the hurricane. There was some concern that a direct hit on Tampa would create even more damage and loss of life. “Tampa Bay was spared in the final hours from the predicted catastrophic storm surge,” Cathie Perkins, head of emergency management for Pinellas County, said according to Reuters. But that’s obviously small comfort to the people in other areas who are cleaning up after the storm. GoFundMe has created a hub of verified crowdfunding campaigns for anyone who’s looking how they can donate directly to people suffering from Hurricane Milton. “In the past two weeks since Helene made landfall, more than $50 million has been raised on GoFundMe for hurricane relief, from more than 400,000 donors across all 50 U.S. states, with an average donation amount of $120,” a spokesperson told Gizmodo in a statement Thursday. “We anticipate many across the Southeast, especially those impacted in Florida, will continue to need support after Milton. In response, GoFundMe has also updated our Hurricane Relief Page with resources for donors looking to help and communities still recovering from Hurricane Helene.” President Joe Biden gave a press conference Thursday afternoon from the White House. “I know recovery and rebuilding projects can take a long and difficult time, but as long after the press and the cameras move on, I promise you, you have to pick up the pieces still,” Biden said. “I want you to know everything on our power to help you put pieces back together and get all that you need,” Biden continued. “God bless you and may God bless our troops and our first responders. Many some cases risking their lives to help.” \nCDCFloridaHurricane MiltonSt. PetersburgTampaTornadoes  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          \"I think this was orchestrated by deep state Harris supporters after Trump’s visit to McDonald’s,\" one Trump supporter wrote.\n         \n          Most illnesses have been identified in Colorado and Nebraska, but 10 states have seen cases so far.\n         \n          Florida health officials have warned residents to stay away from floodwaters, following a spike in cases of Vibrio vulnificus infection.\n         \n          The pouches have become a cause célèbre among anti-regulation conservatives, and a growing number of middle and high school students are using them.\n         \n          The campaign pushes users to IWillVote.com to make sure they're registered.\n         \n          The man faces up to five years in prison for animal cruelty.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Americans are rushing into voting booths across the country today to raise their hand for either Donald Trump (the fascist piece of shit who wants to do bad things) or Kamala Harris (the moderate Democrat who wants to do good things). But the presidency isn’t the only thing on the ballot. Voters will be deciding on local races as well as local issues, including everything from abortion rights to property taxes. And voters in four states will decide the fate of weed legalization, with an additional state even voting on legalizing psychedelics. Recreational cannabis is legal in 24 states, with 38 states allowing for medical use. And it’s impossible to overstate how big of a shift that is from 20 years ago. Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize weed in 2012 and new states have been added ever since, despite it still being illegal at the federal level. Kamala Harris has pledged to make cannabis legal on the federal level if she’s elected president. Meanwhile, Trump has promised to put Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in charge of all things health a the FDA and USDA. You may recall that he’s the guy who wants to ban junk food like Doritos. It seems like a clear choice for stoners, America. Voters in Florida will consider Amendment 3 today, which would legalize cannabis for recreational use for anyone 21 years of age and older. The measure would let people possess up to three ounces of cannabis or five ounces of cannabis concentrate. The measure needs 60% of the vote to be approved and the latest polling is encouraging, with 60% supporting it, 34% opposed, and 6% undecided. Gov. Ron DeSantis, a notorious dipshit who supports Trump, opposes Amendment 3 and has made a big push to campaign against legalization. DeSantis was in Orlando and Miami on Monday to make his case, trying to scare anyone around by using a variety of different angles. “If you’re not 100% convinced that this is a good idea, then you gotta vote no,” DeSantis said, according to local TV news channel WFLA. DeSantis also tried to insist that this measure would help weed businesses, falsely claiming that the measure would only be good for established companies and ban homegrown cannabis. “They do not give you the right to grow your own marijuana on your own property,” DeSantis said. “That’s by design because they’re trying to funnel business transactions to them.” It’s a funny argument coming from a supposedly pro-business “conservative,” of course. But it’s not really about homegrown weed or anything else reasonable or rational, obviously. Guys like DeSantis want recreational weed to stay illegal because the war on drugs is fundamentally a war on poor people and racial minorities. Rich Floridians with good lawyers don’t go to prison when they’re caught with cannabis. That’s for the people DeSantis hates so much. The latest polling average from 538 for Florida has Trump ahead 6.6 points over Harris. Both recreational and medical cannabis are legal in Massachusetts, but the Bay State could become the third state in the country to legalize some psychedelic drugs, following in the path of Oregon and Colorado. Known as Question 4, the ballot measure would legalize things like psilocybin mushrooms from licensed sellers. Five drugs would become legal dimethyltryptamine (DMT), mescaline, ibogaine, psilocybin, and psilocybin, as long as they were obtained by therapy centers for people 21 years of age and older. Retail shops for these drugs would still be illegal, but the bill would also decriminalize possession of these five drugs for personal use. Recent polling shows voters in Massachusetts evenly split on Question 4, with 43% opposing and 43% supporting, according to a recent survey conducted by the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and WCVB. The 14% of people who are undecided on the question are likely to decide how it goes. “This ballot question only enjoys majoritarian support among a small number of demographic and political groups in the state that include young people, Democrats, liberals and Biden voters,”  Tatishe Nteta, the director of the poll, said in a statement published online. “Older voters, independents, Republicans and parents are particularly opposed to this ballot question, and given the high turnout among these groups in particular, this does not bode well for those who seek to make Massachusetts the third state in the nation to make these substances legal,” Nteta said. The latest polling average from 538 for Massachusetts has Harris ahead 26.2 points over Trump. The good people of Nebraska will vote on two measures regarding cannabis today. Ballot Initiative 437 would let healthcare professionals recommend weed to patients while legalizing the possession and use of cannabis for those residents. And Ballot Initiative 438 would create a Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission to regulate the sale and distribution of the drug. How does it look in the Cornhusker State? According to the latest polling from Midwest Newsroom Emerson College, 59% say they’re going to vote yes, and 33% say they’ll vote no, with 8% unsure, reports Nebraska Public Media. A legal case has sought to throw out all the votes, arguing that there was some kind of fraud going on during the signature collection that allowed the marijuana measures to get on the ballot. But a judge recently ruled that the votes will be counted. A final ruling on the case isn’t expected for about two weeks, meaning that even if the initiatives pass, they could still be invalidated down the line, but at least people will get to have their say on the matter. For now. The latest polling average from 538 for Nebraska has Trump ahead 16.4 points over Harris. As one of the most politically conservative states in the country, it’s no surprise that it hasn’t legalized marijuana for recreational use yet, though it has been legal for medical purposes since 2016. Ballot measures to make recreational use legal failed in 2018 and 2022. But advocates are trying it again this year. North Dakota’s Initiated Measure 5 is appearing on the ballot and would legalize recreational use and possession for any residents 21 years of age and older. If it does pass, adults would be allowed to have up to one ounce of cannabis, four grams of concentrate, and 1,500 milligrams of edibles. How will the proposed change fare this time? The latest polling shows 45% support legalization, 40% are opposed, and 15% are undecided, according to the North Dakota Monitor, which notes that the measure is being supported by an organization called New Economic Frontier, which is trying to promote legalization as a good thing for business and tax revenue growth. But legalization has strong opposition from big conservative organizations like the North Dakota Medical and Hospital Associations, North Dakota Peace Officers, Chiefs of Police Association of North Dakota, and the North Dakota Sheriffs and Deputies Associations. FiveThirtyEight doesn’t have a polling average for North Dakota but the latest poll the outlet tracks has Trump ahead 27 points over Harris. South Dakota’s Initiated Measure 29 will be decided by voters on Tuesday, which would legalize the consumption of recreational weed for anyone 21 years of age and older, though it doesn’t legalize the sale of weed and has a special carve-out allowing employers to ban consumption by their employees. Medical cannabis is already legal in the state. But the latest polling does not look good for people who’d like to see recreational marijuana legalized in South Dakota. A disappointing 50% of voters in the state oppose the measure, with 45% supporting it, according to a poll conducted by Emerson College Polling/KELO-TV/The Hill. FiveThirtyEight doesn’t have a polling average for South Dakota but the latest poll the outlet tracks has Trump ahead 28 points over Harris. Nobody knows for sure what will happen on Tuesday, both for the presidency and these weed legalization measures. But if all four states considering weed today vote to legalize it in some form, there will be just 8 of the 50 states where marijuana is completely illegal. And any one of the four states legalizing would bring the number of states with recreational use up to a full half of the entire country, with 25. If you haven’t voted yet today, wherever you are in the U.S., make sure you do that. This is an important one, to say the least. \n2024 electioncannabisDrugselectionmarijuanavapingweed  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Perplexity AI announced a new Election Information Hub, you should probably ignore it.\n         \n          In a paper published today, scientists argue that plenty of animals are regularly consuming and using alcohol, though many questions about the practice still remain.\n         \n          Soldiers will officially be drug tested for gas station weed and delicious poppy seed muffins.\n         \n          Humans have been getting high since basically the dawn of time.\n         \n          It’s potential evidence of some of the earliest European recreational cocaine use.\n         \n          Along with winds of up to 70 miles per hour (112 kilometers per hour), the tropical storm brought 25 packages of coke ashore.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": " After the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in July, the merchandise started showing up on Facebook. Trump, fist in the air, face bloodied from a bullet, appeared on everything. Coffee mugs. Hawaiian shirts. Trading cards. Commemorative coins. Heart ornaments. Ads for these products used images captured at the scene by Doug Mills for the New York Times and Evan Vucci for the Associated Press, showing Trump yelling “fight” after the shooting. The Trump campaign itself even offered some gear commemorating his survival. As the Secret Service drew scrutiny and law enforcement searched for a motive, online advertisers saw a business opportunity in the moment, pumping out Facebook ads to supporters hungry for merch. In the 10 weeks after the shooting, advertisers paid Meta between $593,000 and $813,000 for political ads that explicitly mentioned the assassination attempt, according to The Markup’s analysis. (Meta provides only estimates of spending and reach for ads in its database.) Even Facebook itself has acknowledged that polarizing content and misinformation on its platform has incited real-life violence. An analysis by CalMatters and The Markup found that the reverse is also true: real-world violence can sometimes open new revenue opportunities for Meta. While the spending on assassination ads represents a sliver of Meta’s $100 billion-plus ad revenue, the company also builds its bottom line when tragedies like war and mass shootings occur, in the United States and beyond. After the October 7th attack on Israel last year and the country’s response in Gaza, Meta saw a major increase in dollars spent related to the conflict, according to our review. Tech advocacy groups and others question whether Facebook should even profit from violence and whether its ability to do so violates the company’s own principles of not calling for violence. The company said advertisers often respond to current events and that ads that run on its platform are reviewed and must meet the company’s standards. If you count all of the political ads mentioning Israel since the attack through the last week of September, organizations and individuals paid Meta between $14.8 and $22.1 million dollars for ads seen between 1.5 billion and 1.7 billion times on Meta’s platforms. Meta made much less for ads mentioning Israel during the same period the year before: between $2.4 and $4 million dollars for ads that were seen between 373 million and 445 million times.  At the high end of Meta’s estimates, this was a 450 percent increase in Israel-related ad dollars for the company. (In our analysis, we converted foreign currency purchases to current U.S. dollars.) The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a lobbying group that promotes Israel, was the major spender on ads mentioning Israel. In the six months after October 7th, its spending increased more than 300 percent over the previous six months, to between $1.8 and $2.7 million dollars, as the organization peppered Facebook and Instagram with ads defending Israel’s actions in Gaza and pressuring politicians to support the country. As the war has roiled the region, AIPAC paid Meta about as much for ads in the 15 weeks following October 7th as the entire year before. “Our effort is directed to encouraging pro-Israel Americans to stand with our democratic ally as it battles Iranian proxies in the aftermath of the barbaric Hamas attack of October 7th,” Marshall Wittmann, a spokesperson for AIPAC, said in an emailed statement. Other ad campaigns mentioning Israel supported different sides of the conflict. Doctors Without Borders, for example, used advertising to highlight the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Other ads defended and promoted Israel. The Christian Broadcasting Network tied the October 7th attack to a claim in an ad that Iran’s “final, deadly goal” was “to establish a modern caliphate—an Islamic-founded, tyrannical government—across the world.” Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, takes in the vast majority of its revenue from targeted advertising. The company tracks users online to profile their habits and, when a business or organization wants to reach them, lets those businesses pay to send ads to people who might be interested. Those ads might be tied to something perfectly wholesome, like gardening. But the company’s algorithms don’t distinguish between simple hobbies and something darker. Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton said in an emailed statement that Meta did not ultimately profit from political violence, as advertisers broadly back away from advertising during times of strife for fear their ads will be promoted alongside news of the violence. Clayton noted Meta’s chief financial officer recently said on an earnings call that it is “hard for us to attribute demand softness directly to any specific geopolitical event” but had seen lower ad spending “correlating with the start of the conflict” in the Middle East, and had seen similar at the start of the war in Ukraine. “Advertisers responding to current events are nothing new, and it’s seen across the media landscape, including on television, radio, and online news outlets,” Clayton said. “All ads that run on our platform must go through a review process and adhere to our advertising and community standards, and Meta offers an extra layer of transparency by making them publicly available in our Ad Library.” CalMatters and The Markup used Meta’s own tools to calculate how much Meta makes from spikes in advertising when instances of political violence happen, reviewing thousands of ads through both manual review and with the assistance of an AI model offered by Meta itself. (We also made improvements to Meta Research’s scripts for accessing the Ad Library API, and we’re sharing our changes.) To examine the assassination attempt merchandise, we ran a simple search of Meta’s Ad Library for ads that mentioned “assassination,” including any in our analysis that also mentioned “Trump” and hundreds of others that didn’t mention the former president by name but were clearly related to the shooting. “First they jail him, now they try to end him,” one ad read. A conspiratorial ad for a commemorative two-dollar bill claimed “the assassination attempt was their Plan B,” while “Plan A was to make Biden abandon the presidential campaign.” Some ads used clips from the film JFK to suggest an unseen, malevolent force was at work in the shooting. Gun advocates paid for ads, using the assassination attempt as a foreboding call to action. One ad promoting a firearms safety course noted that “November is fast approaching.” A clothing business said in an ad that, since “the government can’t save you” from foreign enemies, Americans “need to be self-reliant, self-made, and self-sufficient.” “Because when those bullets zip by, you are clearly on your own,” the ad read. Most of those ads did not appear to violate Meta’s policies, although some may have broken its ban against showing weapons while alleging “election-related corruption.” But even the ones that didn’t clearly violate Meta’s rules still place the company in an uncomfortable position, as the business takes in advertising dollars from posts tied to grim news cycles. CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself commented on the first Trump assassination attempt, saying in an interview that it was “one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen in my life.” Trump has now survived a second apparent assassination attempt, and Zuckerburg’s company has made millions of dollars through political advertising tied to these and other violent acts. Katie Paul, director of the Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit advocacy organization, said “it’s not a surprise” that ads around political violence would pop up after incidents “if Meta is not making any effort even on a good day to effectively enforce their policies.” “There’s huge problems with their advertising broadly,” she said. “They’re profiting off of a lot of harmful things, really without any sort of repercussions.” Many businesses paying for the assassination ads sold pro-Trump gear before the shooting — and some might have spent a similar amount on ads if the shooting never happened. But for some, the assassination attempt effectively became an entire business strategy, according to the review of Meta advertising data. A clothing company called Red First, which offers everything from customized shirts for pet owners to flags saying “Hillary belongs in prison,” offered assassination-related merchandise through a network of pages with names like 50 Stars Nation and Red White and Blue Zone. The company, which operates in California and Vietnam, according to Meta’s required disclosures, has spent more than $1.8 million since February 2023 to promote ads through its various pages. But in the wake of the shooting, the company pivoted to merchandise around the event. Red First’s ads were relatively innocuous compared to some that sprang up after the shooting – they promoted Trump, not the shooting, and not the idea of retaliation for it. One shirt showed an illustration of Trump, middle fingers in the air, and the words “you missed bigly.” The company has also offered Kamala Harris merchandise, recently launching a page dedicated to it as well. But the ads related to the shooting simultaneously sold products, promoted Trump, and let Meta reap advertising cash from the incident. Many of the thousands of ads posted by the company didn’t explicitly use the word “assassination,” but clearly referenced the event in other ways, using slogans like “he will overcome,” “fight fight fight,” “legends never die,” and “shooting makes me stronger.” To suss out which ads were related to the shooting, we reviewed more than 4,200 ads from the company’s different pages with the assistance of a large language model named Llama, a Meta AI model. We programmed the model to evaluate the text of each ad to determine whether it was related to the assassination attempt, then manually reviewed hundreds of its classifications to ensure it was working as expected. After our review, we determined that more than 2,600 of those more than 4,200 ads were related to the assassination attempt. The total Red First paid to Meta in the 10 weeks after the shooting for those ads: between $473,000 and $798,000. Red First lists a phone number and street address in Southern California, but didn’t respond to phone or email, and the listed address is for a mail-opening service. The advocacy organization the Tech Transparency Project has charted how the National Rifle Association has paid to promote pro-gun views on Meta and Google’s ad platforms after mass shootings. Despite calls from tech company executives for gun control, those companies profit from NRA spending that spikes after shootings, the group has pointed out. After the mass school shooting in Parkland, Fla., the NRA increased its spending on Google and Facebook ads, the Tech Transparency Project noted in one report. In 2018, the year of the shooting, Meta received “more than $2 million in advertising fees from the NRA starting in May of that year,” the report found, which also found that “NRA ad spending reached its highest levels on Google and soared on Facebook” following a week of mass shootings the following year that left dozens of people dead. Just days before the January 6th insurrection, the Tech Transparency Project found that Meta hosted ads offering gun holsters and rifle accessories in far-right Facebook groups. Internationally, Meta has often lapsed in its pledge to keep violent content off its platforms. Meta’s ad policies forbid calling for violence. But when faced with crucial tests of its content moderation practices, the company has repeatedly failed to detect and remove inflammatory ads. A 2018 report, commissioned by Facebook itself, found that its platform had been used to incite violence in Myanmar, and that the company hadn’t done enough to prevent it. Alia Al Ghussain, a researcher on technology issues at Amnesty International, said that as troubling as some ads might be in English, ads in other languages may be even more likely to pass Meta’s content moderation. “In most of the non-English-speaking world, Facebook doesn’t have the resources that it needs to moderate the content on the platform effectively and safely,” she said. Despite later admitting responsibility for violence in Myanmar, the company continues to be faulted for gaps in its international moderation work. Another advocacy organization found in a test that the company approved calls for the murder of ethnic groups in Ethiopia. More recently, a similar test by an advocacy organization found that ads explicitly calling for violence against Palestinians—a flagrant violation of Meta’s rules—were still approved to run by the company. “If ads which are presenting a risk of stoking tension or spreading misinformation are being approved in the US, in English, it really makes me fearful for what is happening in other countries in non-English-speaking languages,” Al Ghussain said.
