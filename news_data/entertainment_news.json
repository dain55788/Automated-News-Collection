            "content": "When Hollywood’s writers and actors went on strike last year, it was, in part, because of AI. Actors didn’t care for the notion that their likenesses could be used without their permission, whether by the studios that hired them that week or by someone at home with a computer in 2040. Writers didn’t want to do punch-ups on potentially crummy AI scripts or have their words (or ideas) cannibalized by large language models that didn’t pay them a dime. But while some Hollywood filmmakers came out of the strikes fearful of how AI might wreck their industries, others wanted to learn more. This week, many of those filmmakers gathered in a movie theater in Culver City, California, for the inaugural Culver Cup, a generative-AI film competition sponsored by FBRC.AI and Amazon Web Services. Hundreds of moviemakers applied to be in the competition, and 50 were chosen. They got prompts and a production manifesto from Black Mirror: Bandersnatch and Hard Candy director David Slade, credits to use on AI tools like Luma Dream Machine and Playbook, and a 3D version of a diner from Global Objects to use as a setting. They had a little under three weeks to turn in a two- to five-minute short. From those, eight were chosen to compete (you can watch seven of them here), in-person, with the audience at Monday’s LA Tech Week event selecting the ultimate winner. The Culver Cup championship belt that is awarded to the winner of the Culver Cup gen AI film competition. The final bracket for the Culver Cup. The competition was meant to be “a little experiment,” says FBRC.AI cofounder Todd Terrazas, a way to gauge where the still nascent scene is now compared to where it’s been and where it’s going. Some mistakes in the shorts were inevitable, like inconsistencies in characters or noticeable visual artifacts, but event attendees generally seemed to come away impressed. Jon Jones, the head of AWS Startups, says the point was to see “what’s possible, not what’s perfect.” Figuring out what’s possible is a fraught proposition when it comes to AI in Hollywood. Because even while AWS Startups is working with companies making generative AI tools for filmmaking, the division of Amazon that produces content for Prime Video spent much of last year bargaining with writers’ and actors’ unions, as part of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, over best practices for using AI in movie- and TV-making. The AMPTP has been negotiating with animators over AI, among other things, since August. Amazon MGM Studios wasn’t involved with the Culver Cup. Instead, the event was an attempt to show how AI could be used to automate processes that independent filmmakers couldn’t do on their own. Hollywood will have to figure out the most fair way to use them. A similar refrain came out of Adobe’s Max conference this week, where the company showed off new AI-powered video-editing tools while claiming they’re “not a replacement for human creativity.” Meta sang a similar tune on Thursday, when the company announced a collaboration with Blumhouse for which the horror studio paired filmmakers—Casey Affleck, Searching’s Aneesh Chaganty—with Meta researchers to test out its forthcoming Movie Gen video tool. Connor Hayes, Meta’s head of gen AI, said in a blog post that it was about figuring out the “responsible use” of AI. Blumhouse CEO Jason Blum said the studio “welcomed the chance” to allow directors to “test this cutting-edge technology and give their notes on its pros and cons while it’s still in development.” As a longtime director, Slade says he saw his role in the Culver Cup similarly. He wants to be a sober voice in the conversation about the technology’s role in filmmaking, even as he’s quick to admit that “there are things that terrify [him] about AI.” If anyone can make a gen AI film, he argues, then perhaps that’s how you find the next James Cameron or the next David Lynch. “I couldn’t make a full-length, Pixar-like feature film on my own, just due to the amount of time to do every single second of animation,” says Playbook CTO Skylar Thomas, “but with gen AI, the volume that the individual contributor can create is that much higher, and that’s super exciting.” (It’s also cheaper, with Playbook cofounder JD LeRoy noting that a single second of VFX in a movie can cost anywhere from $2,000 to $20,000, depending on complexity.) Gen AI also means filmmakers can do more with less—or without access to the bureaucrats, budgets, and gatekeepers that have traditionally dictated what gets made in Hollywood. “The thing about making films is that, if you go to a studio, it costs a million dollars to take the camera out of the box,” says Slade. “That’s just the way it is. You’re immediately working in a very high-stress scenario where a lot of people are asking a lot of you and you’re asking a lot of permission to do everything you do.” Granted, gen AI’s next auteur, animated or otherwise, probably won’t just be some Joe off the street with an idea and no technical know-how. Most of the Culver Cup finalists have some sort of filmmaking background or education, which has clearly given them a leg up in terms of the technical processes and general lingo involved in creation. The contest’s winner, who goes by the name Meta Puppet, says he’s been a full-time video editor for 18 years, as well as an actor and a screenwriter. “You have to learn the fundamentals,” he says. “Technology will change, but storytelling won’t.” To make his short, “Mnemonade,” really sing, Meta Puppet says he focused on giving the story some emotional heft. “I don’t think AI films will go fully mainstream until we get emotional dialog,” he says. He played all the roles in his short, about the poignance of sense memory and an elderly woman’s loss of memory, using AI from Silicon Valley “unicorn” ElevenLabs to shift his vocal performance into each character’s range and voice. Maddie Hong, who went head-to-head with Meta Puppet in the Culver Cup finals, says that she understands Hollywood’s trepidation when it comes to AI. “There’s more potential for legal backlash and financial loss,” she says, referring to the danger of unintended (or even flagrant) copyright infringement during generation. The studios also have a “higher standard for image continuity,” Hong says, “given that they’re thinking about distribution on all types of platforms and screens.” That being said, Hong agrees with people like Luma cofounder Amit Jain, who says that gen AI filmmaking could give the traditional studio system some flexibility in terms of budget and diversity of product. “If you look at Hollywood today,” Jain says, “the majority of the high-budget productions are just recycling old franchises because it’s too tough to bet on a new idea or a new franchise .” It’s just safer, he says, to reproduce something than it is to imagine something new. In Jain’s (admittedly biased) view, making more projects, even with lower budgets, means more people will work and more money will come rolling in. “I would actually posit,” he adds, “that people will actually have far better careers that are more fulfilling and long-lasting when they’re able to produce things that people actually do want to watch.” If there’s going to be any job loss in Hollywood because of AI, he suggests, the people who are going to go will be the ones most resistant to AI. Recent research contradicts that notion. A survey of 300 entertainment industry leaders conducted earlier this year found that 75 percent believed gen AI had led to the elimination, reduction, or consolidation of jobs within their departments. It had also led to the creation of some jobs, but it was “not clear” if new jobs would offset jobs lost. Other studies have examined how the VFX world in particular might be affected by more AI in production, with artists typically reporting interest or excitement around tools that could streamline their sometimes tedious workflows, but concern about the ethical and financial implications of the technology. While it would be cool, as Jain suggests, to team up with 11 of your friends to “make a feature film about a Boston Terrier that has superpowers” for relatively little money, it remains to be seen what effect the impact of sweeping AI availability will have on the industry as a whole. For Meta Puppet, it comes down to skill, and who has it. “I liken gen AI to the piano,” he says. “Everybody knows about the piano. Not everybody is Mozart. Writing real masterpieces with AI, you have to wear a lot of hats, which is a good and a bad thing because if you have experience, that’s great. If you don’t, whatever you make is probably going to be bad.” This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

            "content": "By  Andrew Webster, an entertainment editor covering streaming, virtual worlds, and every single Pokémon video game. Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories. In 2018, Nintendo invited me to a meeting in New York City to see a mysterious new initiative. It was teased as an “interactive experience for Nintendo Switch,” which sent my mind to all sorts of places. This is the company that made a weird dual-screen Game Boy and bongo controllers, after all. It could be anything. Even still, I did not guess that I would spend that meeting folding bits of cardboard — or that those cardboard accessories would turn out to be so awesome. That was the moment I completely gave up on trying to guess what Nintendo would do next. That meeting has been on my mind quite a bit over the last few weeks. While much of the game industry has been on edge in anticipation of whatever the follow-up to the Switch will be, Nintendo has focused on pretty much anything and everything else.  Last month, I went to visit the company in Kyoto, but not to see new hardware; instead, I went on a tour of the just-opened Nintendo Museum. This month, Nintendo did announce a new gadget, but instead of a console, it was an alarm clock. And just this week, details started trickling out about the company’s secretive online test, which some predicted would provide hints at the Switch 2. Nope: instead, it seems to be an online game in the vein of Minecraft. Three big moments, zero Switch successors. This isn’t new, of course. Nintendo generally goes its own way. When Sony and Microsoft ushered in the current generation of consoles, Nintendo launched a new version of the Game & Watch, an LCD handheld from the ’80s. But the rapid succession of announcements and reveals from the company over the last few weeks has been surprising and indicative of its idiosyncratic nature. And while it might seem random, the weeks full of museum openings and alarm clock launches are likely part of a very calculated strategy. It could mean a few things. Maybe Nintendo is clearing the runway to keep the focus on the Switch 2 whenever it does decide to announce it. In the Switch era, Nintendo has become much more adept at clear messaging, which hasn’t always been the case. Just think back to when the Wii U was first announced, and some (myself included) initially confused it for a Wii accessory. So it makes a lot of sense to get this other stuff out of the way before the next console. Nintendo Direct presentations have become huge moments, and the one dedicated to the next console will possibly be the biggest to date. You don’t want to mess that up. It could also be an indication of where Nintendo is right now. This is a company that doesn’t want to be only known for games. Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto said as much when I was in Kyoto in September. “A lot of people may see Nintendo as a video game company,” he explained during a press conference. “But what I wanted to express with this museum is that we are first and foremost an entertainment company.” While it’s been building a new console in secret and sending out its current one on a high note, it has also been branching out in new directions. That includes bringing Nintendo experiences into the real world through a theme park partnership with Universal — an initiative so important that Miyamoto has played a major role — and a (so far) successful jump into feature films with The Super Mario Bros. Movie, created by Minions studio Illumination. It’s relatively early days, but the company is using its long-running success in games to transform into an entertainment empire. Which is to say, Nintendo has a lot more irons in the fire than just a new console. Maybe we’ll get a live-action Zelda movie trailer before we see the Switch 2. Doing things differently isn’t always a guarantee of success, of course, and Nintendo has certainly had its share of failures. These glory days of the Switch, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, and Super Nintendo World famously happened in the aftermath of the Wii U, Nintendo’s worst-selling home console to date. It took 30 years for the company to follow up the infamous original Mario movie flop with a billion-dollar film. The industry ebbs and flows, and it only takes one console generation to move from the top of the market to the bottom. That only makes it harder to predict what Nintendo will do; I certainly would have never guessed the Switch was its next system back in 2017 or that it would go on to outsell the Wii and Game Boy. This is all a long way of saying that, just like when I sat down in front of some stacks of cardboard in New York, I am currently at a loss trying to figure out what Nintendo’s execs are thinking. I have some ideas, of course, helped along by a steady stream of rumors, but no real sense of what the company’s next console will look like or when it will be announced. All I know for sure is that it won’t be boring. But if it is? That’d be another big surprise.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Fans will finally see Michelle Yeoh’s Star Trek: Discovery character, Emperor Philippa Georgiou, put her Mirrorverse skills to use as a super secret space spy. When we last saw Emperor Georgiou (an alternate dimension version of Captain Georgiou Discovery’s first season) she was flung back in time by a being called the Guardian of Forever. Before that, though, she had been recruited as a member of Section 31, the clandestine organization that the Trek franchise often uses to illustrate that even the glossy Federation has a shady side. The film, originally announced as a TV series in 2019 before being reintroduced as a movie, will follow her time as a Section 31 operative who “must face the sins of her past.” In addition to Yeoh, Section 31 will also star Sam Richardson, Sven Ruygrok, Omari Hardwick, Robert Kazinsky, and Miku Martineau, who plays “a young Philippa Georgiou.” Paramount Plus subscribers can stream it anywhere the service is available on January 24th.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Spotify now has a new “Create cover art” option for playlists that lets you make custom collages to represent your playlists. The beta feature, which is available for both free and Spotify Premium members, is launching for English users in 65 markets. The company says it partnered with artists like Ugly Primo, who designed Bad Bunny’s Un Verano Sin Ti album cover, and Cey Adams, who has worked on albums and logos for The Notorious B.I.G and Beastie Boys. I gave it a shot and produced the masterpiece below, using a picture I took of a possum that was lurking outside my kid’s bedroom one night. It’s a pleasantly robust image maker, with layering, various effects, and the ability to rotate or change the size of images. It’s still in beta, and at the moment, you can’t edit images once you’ve saved them, or even save drafts. YouTube Music introduced a similar feature last year that uses AI with preselected themes and prompt elements. Spotify easily could have gone the same route but chose to do something more interactive and engaging than tapping through a short menu. It also says it hired actual artists to make the 40 stickers that users can add to their pictures. To try it out, open a playlist you’ve made, tap the three dots button, then tap “Create cover art.” (You may need to close the app and reopen it to see this.)   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Steam Game Recording is officially out of beta and available to all users, giving PC, Mac, and Steam Deck players a built-in way to record and share audio and video from their gaming sessions. It joins many other ways PC gamers have been able to record their highlights, including as a feature of tools like the Xbox Game Bar, Nvidia GeForce, and AMD’s Adrenalin. This version of the Steam client is also the first to drop support for Windows 7 and 8 machines, as well as Macs running macOS 10.13 and 10.14 after Valve announced the move at the beginning of this year.  After an automatic update, players can start recordings manually using a hotkey (Ctrl + F11 is the default) or set it to trigger automatically, with options to restrict the length, quality, and storage space that Steam can use. Valve says it works with any game, including non-Steam games that allow Steam Overlay to run. Recording is off by default — you’ll find its settings in a new Game Recording tab in Steam’s settings.  Valve has updated Steam Game Recording with a handful of new features that weren’t there when the beta period began in June, including adding “advanced” export options and the ability to configure game-specific settings. The company also added Session View, which includes a “Recordings & Screenshots manager with game-specific tags and data.”   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Google is rolling out some new Chrome memory management features aimed at helping you wrangle out-of-control tabs more easily. The updates include new “Performance issue alerts” and some tweaks to the existing Memory Saver mode, which already tries to free up the resources of inactive tabs in the background. The new alerts appear when a new Performance Detection tool finds that one of your tabs is using more resources than it should. The notification appears next to your account thumbnail in Chrome’s toolbar as a tiny graphic that looks like a speedometer. (If I didn’t know about it already, I might think I’d accidentally added an Ookla Speedtest extension to my browser.) If you click the graphic, it will list the offending tabs and give you the option to “Dismiss” or “Fix now.”  Here’s what it looks like: Google also updated Memory Saver, a feature that the company introduced to Chrome in 2022 that snoozes tabs when they’re hogging your computer’s resources. Google spokesperson Scott Westover has confirmed to The Verge via email that the modes are named “Moderate,” “Balanced,” and “Maximum,” as in the screenshot at the bottom of this article. (As of this writing, Google’s blog lists the names incorrectly; Westover said this will be corrected later today.) According to Google, Moderate interprets your system’s needs and manages tabs for you, Balanced operates based on system needs and your browsing habits, and Maximum will deactivate tabs the fastest after you stop using them.  To check out the new settings, simply click the three-dot menu in the upper-right corner of Chrome, click Settings, and click the “Performance” tab on the left. You should see a new “Performance issue alerts” toggle under General and updated Memory Saver options in Memory below that. Here are our screenshots, if you want to see what the Performance issue alert toggle looks like. Update, October 29th: Updated with Google spokesperson Scott Westover’s confirmation of the Memory Saver mode names.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Thousands of creatives, including famous actors like Kevin Bacon and Kate McKinnon, along with other actors, authors, and musicians, have signed a statement warning that the unpermitted use of copyrighted materials to train AI models threatens the people who made those creative works. 11,500 names are on the list of signatories so far. Here is the one-sentence statement: “The unlicensed use of creative works for training generative AI is a major, unjust threat to the livelihoods of the people behind those works, and must not be permitted.” The statement was published by Fairly Trained, a group advocating for fair training data use by AI companies. Fairly Trained CEO Ed Newton-Rex told The Guardian that generative AI companies need “people, compute, and data” to build their models, and while they spend “vast sums” on the former two, they “expect to take the third – training data – for free.” Newton-Rex founded Fairly Trained after he quit Stability AI, accusing generative AI of “exploiting creators.”  Several professionals and organizations like News Corp and the Recording Industry Association of America have sued AI companies for using copyrighted work while training AI models.  The RIAA is among the organizations that have signed Fairly Trained’s statement and has even posted about it. As has the News/Media Alliance.  There are also some notable names not appearing among the signatories. Scarlett Johansson, who had a high-profile spat with OpenAI after accusations it modeled GPT-4o’s voice after her, isn’t on the list. Neither are actors like Dame Judi Dench and John Cena, who signed up to have Meta AI’s voice chat system replicate them.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Someone gained access to Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni robotic vacuums across several US cities earlier this year and used them to chase pets and yell racist slurs at their owners, reported ABC News in Australia this week.  The outlet spoke with multiple Deebot X2 owners who say their Deebot X2s had been hacked in May, including Minnesota lawyer Daniel Swenson, who said he was watching TV with his family when a noise “like a broken-up radio signal or something” started coming from the robot’s speaker. He said after he reset his password and rebooted the robot, it began again, only this time the sound was clearly a voice — he guessed a teenager’s — yelling slurs.  ABC News lists other, similar accounts from owners in El Paso and Los Angeles, the latter of which involved someone using a Deebot to antagonize a dog, yelling at and chasing it.  Ecovacs told the outlet in a statement that it had “identified a credential stuffing event” and blocked the IP address it originated from. The company said it “found no evidence” that usernames and passwords were collected by the attacker. Researchers demonstrated a flaw last year that let them bypass the Deebot X2’s PIN entry to gain access to the vacuum. Ecovacs says in its statement that it has resolved that, and that it also plans to “further enhance security” with an update in November. It’s not clear whether that would correct a Bluetooth vulnerability that ABC News exploited for a report earlier this month. Cloud-connected smart home devices have led to stories like this for years. Sometimes it’s the result of hacks, others simply compromised credentials. Sometimes, it’s bad software showing you another owner’s camera feed, as a little treat. Issues like these can feel inevitable when so many smart home devices require a persistent internet connection to function, especially for those companies that don’t offer easy ways to report security vulnerabilities.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Both T-Mobile and AT&T have plans to release their first devices soon that run on RedCap, a 5G specification that is tooled for Internet of Things devices, according to Fierce Wireless.  What is RedCap? Great question! Also called “reduced capability” or NR-Light, RedCap is a low-bandwidth version of 5G that’s expected to make certain devices, like wearables, sensors, or surveillance cameras simpler and more power efficient, according to an Oracle document. That could mean cheaper cellular-connected smartwatches, XR glasses, or other portable products that don’t need high-powered antennas and fast throughput last longer on a charge.  AT&T, which began testing the spec on its own network early this year, reportedly plans to release its first NR-Light devices in 2025, Fierce Wireless writes. T-Mobile will launch one of its own before this year is out.  It’s not clear what those devices will be, but AT&T AVP of device architecture Jason Sikes has hinted at what early NR-Light products could look like, telling Fierce in June that the first RedCap devices will probably be cheap mobile hotspots and dongles. Indeed, TCL announced a 5G USB dongle last week, catchily named the TCL Linkport IK511. Early products could use a modem chipset Qualcomm launched last year called the Snapdragon X35. It listed several companies in its announcement, including T-Mobile and AT&T, that plan to use the modem in future products. Perhaps we’ll hear more during CES early next year. Let the (slow) race to 5G begin. Correction October 14th: An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of an AT&T executive. It is Jason Sikes, not Jason Silkes.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly. The Verge is a vox media network © 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

            "content": "By  Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. Stellantis says it will put a “demonstration fleet” of Dodge Charger Daytonas on the road by 2026, equipped with solid-state battery technology that’s lighter, more energy-dense, and could eventually make for cheaper EVs. The company calls the demo fleet a “key next step” toward making solid-state EVs that you can actually buy. The cars will be built on its STLA Large EV platform, which is meant to underpin more than just the Chargers it’s demoing next year. If its demo is successful, there’s a chance that cars from brands like Maserati and Jeep will get the new battery tech, too. There’s probably a reason Stellantis says “solid-state battery technology” rather than simply solid-state batteries. That’s because these Chargers will use semi-solid-state batteries, which means they’re still made with liquid electrolytes too. That hybrid approach carries benefits like lighter weight and more range, but doesn’t totally obviate the fire risk of traditional lithium batteries. Factorial, which makes the batteries Stellantis will use, claims its semi-solid-state tech could push EV range up by as much as 50 percent versus today’s electric cars, and that the batteries have “drop-in compatibility with existing lithium-ion battery manufacturing infrastructure,” making them cheaper and easier to produce than switching to full solid-state tech would be.  Solid-state batteries have been hard to develop and not every company has been able to hack it. Nissan had promised it would be producing “all-solid-state” EVs by 2028, but seemed to walk that back this year. Fisker totally abandoned its own efforts to make solid-state batteries in 2021. But Volkswagen, which was to provide Fisker’s platform, recently announced that its batteries had passed an endurance test. Stellantis’ announcement is a sign of progress, and it’s not the only company making some. Hyundai is a Factorial investor, and so is Mercedes, which said it would have Factorial’s semi-solid-state batteries “in EVs on the road in 2026,” according to Reuters. Honda plans to introduce solid-state EVs in the latter half of the decade, while Toyota’s roadmap includes mass-producing solid-state batteries that enable more than 621 miles of range by 2028.  In China, IM Motor launched the L6, a semi-solid-state battery-driven EV, in April, while its sister brand, MG, announced it will unveil one in Europe next year.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Apple’s new iPad Mini might be hogging the spotlight, but it’s not the only great tablet on the market. If you’re looking for a slate outside of Apple’s ecosystem, the original OnePlus Pad is a terrific Android tablet that OnePlus is selling for $359.99 ($120 off) — a new all-time low — until October 20th at 11:59PM ET. To make the deal even sweeter, OnePlus is also throwing in a free OnePlus Magnetic Keyboard worth $149.99. Note that to get the discount, you’ll have to apply the on-page coupon, which you can find when you click on the “Claim now” button under ”Check out all offers.” The last-gen tablet still offers excellent value for your money. Its MediaTek Dimensity 9000 processor is snappy enough, while the OnePlus Pad’s sharp 11.6-inch LCD offers a speedy 144Hz refresh rate that’s rare to find at this price point. What’s more, it also comes equipped with an impressive quad-speaker system that supports Dolby Atmos, rendering it a particularly terrific device for watching movies. The Android tablet app ecosystem is limited, and the OnePlus Pad offers few useful multitasking features, so I wouldn’t recommend this as a work device. But if you just need a tablet for light productivity work and entertainment purposes, few tablets in this price range can rival the OnePlus Pad. OnePlus’ first tablet punches above its weight thanks to excellent performance, great build quality, and a terrific 11.6-inch LCD display that offers up to 144Hz refresh rates.

            "content": "By  Andrew Webster, an entertainment editor covering streaming, virtual worlds, and every single Pokémon video game. Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories. After the launch of Gris, a beautiful game exploring grief, the team at Nomada Studio in Barcelona needed a long break. They spent around half a year not even thinking about what was next, avoiding words like “Unity” or “sequel.” Eventually, director Conrad Roset, who became a parent during that time, came up with the idea of a similar experience that would introduce a new companion, allowing players to connect with and care for another character. “I told him, no problem, as long as it’s not a four-legged animal, you can do whatever you want,” says lead producer Roger Mendoza, noting that animating critters with lots of legs can be “quite painful.” But the director was able to make the case for a game called Neva about a young woman who goes on an emotional journey with a magical fox creature. “I think it was worth it,” Mendoza admits. Neva launches on October 15th (it’s coming to PC, Switch, Xbox, and PS5), and like Gris, it’s a stunningly animated 2D adventure. Players take on the role of a young woman caring for a young fox pup named Neva, trying to usher it to safety in a world filled with dark forces that look ripped out of Spirited Away. It only takes around five hours to finish, but the game spans a long period of time; each chapter is a different season, and you see the fox grow over time. At first, it’s a relatively helpless pup, but by the end, it becomes your protector. Neva and Gris share a lot in common: the short length, approachable gameplay, incredible art and animation, and narrative that’s told almost entirely without words. (Neva does have some voice acting, but it’s multiple variations of the heroine calling out Neva’s name. “I think we recorded 500 different ways of saying Neva,” jokes Mendoza.) But the new game also introduces two major features: not only a second character but also combat. “When she’s not with you, you really feel it.” According to Mendoza, the latter was inspired by the former. “[The addition of Neva] was in a way where the combat came from — we thought it would be a good mechanic to bring together the fact that there’s a companion now,” he explains. Early on, you have to fight to protect the fox, but as she grows up and changes, so, too, does that dynamic. “Now she’s the one who is taking care of you,” Mendoza says. “When she’s not with you, you really feel it. Combat felt like a good way to tie everything together.” This presented a number of design challenges, most notably in terms of accessibility. One of Gris’ biggest strengths was how easy it was to pick up and play; it even worked well on a smartphone touchscreen. But the added layer of complexity that comes from combat and a companion meant that Neva “isn’t as approachable as Gris,” according to Mendoza. “That’s something that we knew early on; the moment you add more controls, it becomes more difficult.” To account for this, the developers designed the game from the beginning with a story mode, where you can’t die in battle. “That was a way to try to find the right balance,” he says. The success of Gris — the game sold more than 3 million copies to date — gave the studio the confidence to both push in these more ambitious directions but also continue to pursue its strengths. One of the major learnings from that game, according to Mendoza, was that “you can do a strong narrative without the need for words. It’s something that we had no idea if it would work on Gris.” Neva takes things a step further, with a more direct storyline that covers a number of topics simultaneously — not only the evolving nature of a parental relationship but also overt themes about environmental destruction. Again, this story is conveyed almost entirely through art, sound, and animation. The other major learning from Gris was more practical. One of the main reasons that game’s development was so stressful and required such a long post-launch vacation was that the team was relatively small. In fact, only two programmers worked on Gris at all, forcing lots of late nights and long hours. Now that many members of Nomada are a little older, with families of their own, work-life balance is a much bigger priority. And so one of the most important changes between Gris and Neva was a seemingly simple one: “we hired more programmers.”  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Andrew Webster, an entertainment editor covering streaming, virtual worlds, and every single Pokémon video game. Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories. More than most genres, survival horror feels rooted in time. It started with the methodical Resident Evil on the original PlayStation and is defined in part by limitation — a slow pace, grimy visuals, and scant resources to help amplify the scares. Many of those elements stemmed from the early, awkward days of 3D gaming, whether it was Resident Evil’s clunky controls, which made zombie chases more terrifying, or Silent Hill’s fog, which lent an iconic atmosphere while also letting the developers get around technical limitations of the time. And a few decades later, developers are still finding ways to bring the most important elements of those games — namely, the mood and scares — to modern horror without feeling dated. The most obvious way to do this is keeping the style and tone of classic survival horror while updating the gameplay to make it more approachable. The most recent example of this is Fear the Spotlight, the first release from horror movie studio Blumhouse’s new gaming label. Much like Crow Country and Signalis, it’s a game that looks like it was ripped right out of 1998; the visuals are blocky, the textures low-res. It gives the experience a grimy feel, which is just the right note for horror. Fear the Spotlight — developed by the two-person team at Cozy Game Pals — starts out simple enough, with two friends breaking into their high school to perform a seance in the library. But, of course, things go bad, and they get pulled into a nightmare realm that connects both to their own pasts and a dark mystery the school has been hiding for decades. It’s part coming-of-age story, part romance, and part true crime. But it’s all rendered in the crunchy style of PlayStation-era horror, which lends it an uneasy edge. The game also lets you really focus on the story by streamlining the gameplay. There’s a lot of puzzle-solving; much like in early Resident Evil games, you’ll be fixing all kinds of complex mechanical problems and dealing with arcane statues and locks. But there’s almost no actual combat. Instead, you have little choice but to run and hide when the terrifying monsters appear. Some of the scariest moments of the game have you huddled under a desk, waiting for the creatures — which have deadly spotlights for faces — to pass. In some ways, removing combat makes the game even scarier since you have no way to fight back. These moments in Fear the Spotlight reminded me a bit of stowing away in a locker in Alien: Isolation, hoping the xenomorph couldn’t see me. The hazy, dirty visuals only amplify this feeling, as it’s often difficult to get a clear view of what’s ahead of you. On the other side of the spectrum is the recent remake of Silent Hill 2. Instead of creating a brand-new survival horror experience with modern sensibilities, it’s an attempt to take one of the genre’s most influential titles — a particularly idiosyncratic one at that — and reimagine it as a big-budget release in 2024. That has pros and cons. Like the remakes of classic Resident Evil games and the original Dead Space, Silent Hill 2 looks and plays like a modern release. The visuals are crisp and detailed, instead of hazy and disorienting. And it controls like a well-tuned third-person action game. It’s immensely satisfying to swing a bat, whether you’re smashing in windows or fending off a living mannequin. There’s a shift in tone. The modern Silent Hill 2 is still scary. The level of realism makes the squirming enemies and cramped hotel hallways feel incredibly unsettling, and there’s a level of immersion that can be panic-inducing. But now it plays and feels like a lot of other games and is, for lack of a better word, a lot cleaner than the original. It’s no longer as weird and distinct. It reminds me a bit of the 2018 remake of Shadow of the Colossus: a cover song that doesn’t replace the original but provides a different way of looking at it, one that’s welcoming for newcomers. (If only Konami made the original Silent Hill 2 more accessible.) The point is, these games show there is still plenty of room to do interesting things with survival horror. And they do it in a way that both connected to the genre’s history without being stifled by it. More importantly: they find new ways to scare. Fear the Spotlight and Silent Hill 2 are both available now.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Hi, friends! Welcome to Installer No. 60, your guide to the best and Verge-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, it’s a lot of gaming stuff this week, and also you can read all the old editions at the Installer homepage.)  This week, I’ve been… doomscrolling about the election, if I’m honest. But let’s not talk about that. I’ve also been reading about shipwrecks and in-flight magazines and baseball bat influencers, making a bunch of lists in Listy, dusting off my Bluesky account as Threads becomes increasingly worse, logging a surprising number of hours in VR with Batman: Arkham Shadow, playing with tasks and notes in the Craft beta, seeing if I can replace Gmail with Thunderbird for Android, and trying really, really hard to convince myself I don’t need a new Mac Mini.  I also have for you a couple of new games to play this weekend, some fun stuff to watch, a nifty new way for Mac users to take notes, and more. And I have some ideas for everyone looking for a place to put all their articles, newsletters, and other online stuff.  Oh, housekeeping note: Installer’s off next week. We have some planning meetings going on, and also, honestly, this is one of the driest times of the year when it comes to new stuff. I’ll be back with a big issue in two weeks ahead of Thanksgiving, and then we have some fun plans through the rest of the year. All right, it’s a lot of games this week. Which feels right. Let’s go. (As always, the best part of Installer is your ideas and tips. What are you comfort watching this week? What have you been playing / reading / downloading / baking that everyone else should know about, too? Tell me everything: installer@theverge.com. And if you know someone else who might enjoy Installer, tell them to subscribe here.)  / A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. Last week, a lot of you reached out saying you were bummed to see that Omnivore, a really great app for reading articles, newsletters, and other stuff, was shutting down. I was bummed, too! I’ve recommended Omnivore to a lot of people and really liked the app. (PSA, by the way: if you’re still using Omnivore, you only have a few more weeks to get your stuff out.)  Now, a bunch of us are stuck trying to figure out where to go. So I asked you all to share what you need most in an app like this — and lots of you did! Thanks, as always, to everyone who reached out with thoughts and recommendations. I think I have a pretty good sense of what we’re all looking for, so let me try and recommend a few things.  The best answer for most people, I think, is to use an RSS reader like Feedbin to compile all your incoming stuff and then a read-later app like Instapaper to go through your reading list. Readwise Reader is the closest thing I’ve found to Omnivore’s all-in-one capability, and it’s definitely the one I’d recommend to people looking for a one-to-one replacement, but you’ll pay pretty handsomely for it. Maybe Omnivore was too good to be true this whole time. I’ve been listening to Brian McCullough talk for a really long time. I think I first encountered his work on the Internet History Podcast, which is like a treasure trove of early Silicon Valley stories. He also hosts the Techmeme Ride Home podcast, which is an awesome way to get daily tech news. And more recently, I’ve been listening to his newest show, RAD! 80s90s History. (I might even be on that show in a few weeks… stay tuned.) And in addition to all that, McCullough is a general partner at the Ride Home Fund, investing in tech companies. Busy guy, that Brian. I asked Brian to share his homescreen to see if we might learn how he manages it all. Here it is, plus some info on the apps he uses and why: The phone: An iPhone 16 Pro. For the first time in my life of using iPhones, I have a case on it,  because my son dropped my previous one twice and shattered the front and back glass. I wouldn’t have upgraded this year except for that. So, lesson learned. Kids. The wallpaper: The wallpaper is a picture I took some night on Prospect Park West years ago. The lockscreen is obviously an old iPod interface, my favorite version of the iPod. I bought it from some collection of wallpapers about a year ago. Can’t remember where from, though. The apps: Phone, Fantastical, Apple Maps, Settings, Slack, Microsoft Word, Shopify, Citi Bike, Audible, Microsoft OneNote, Carrot Weather, Amazon, Jersey Mike’s, Wallet, Tovala, Threads, X, York, Claude, Messages, Overcast, Safari, Superhuman. I’m fairly basic with the apps, as you can see. Apps to get news from, like Threads and Twitter. Slack for work. Superhuman for email.  I’ve totally moved over to Claude in the last few months thanks to Alex Kantrowitz evangelizing it to me constantly. So much so that I’ve canceled my OpenAI subscription. Tovala is a smart oven / meal plan company that I’ve been using religiously since the pandemic. Basically my lunch every single day is a Tovala meal. Jersey Mike’s finally came to Park Slope and so that’s also a meal go-to. I use Citi Bike once or twice a day.  The app that says “York” is interesting. That’s my subway stop for my office in Dumbo. This random dude made this thing that you can get at Nextstop.nyc. Basically, it gives you real-time train times for whatever subway stops you use all the time, and then you put an icon for that on your phone. IT. IS. AMAZING. It is insane that, 20 years into my living in NYC, it took this long for someone to do this right. “I’m about to leave the office, when is the next train? Should I leave now or wait five minutes?” Amazing. I also asked Brian to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he sent back: Here’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well!

For even more great recommendations, check out the replies to this post on Threads. “Superfan. A beautiful app to keep tabs on ongoing sports events and matches.” – Karan “I’ve been using this little-known news app called Adarga Panoptic. Has this interesting take on the news where it’s provided through the lens of a person’s perspective rather than just headlines. Content is a bit limited, but with some added customization options, this could be a really cool way to see the news differently.” – Alen “Scribe Notes. It’s like Whisper Memos but has more features. Sort of like Cleft but cheaper. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and I love it. Helps me get my scrambled thoughts and to-dos out of my head and into a place where I can make sense of them all.” – David “Check out the Mobapad M6 HD for the Nintendo Switch! It’s a Joy-Con alternative that has ergonomic grips, Hall effect joysticks, and gyro and HD rumble. It essentially has every feature of the Joy-Cons, but they’re actually comfy to hold. The buttons are a little clicky, and the travel case is almost as bulky as my Steam Deck, but it’s definitely the most comfortable and feature-packed Joy-Con alternative I’ve found. I picked one up on a recent trip to Hong Kong, and it completely changed my Switch playing experience.” – Kevin “I’ve been keeping an eye on an app called Openvibe. It’s able to aggregate your Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon (and Nostr, too, if you’re into that kind of thing) feeds into a single feed you can scroll. The home feed algorithm is hit or miss, but the trending feed is great, especially because it’s not something Mastodon or Bluesky have natively. Also, it lets you cross-post to all four networks for free!” – Drake “Winter is looming, so I got myself a Zwift Ride smart bike for days when running outside just isn’t a great idea. Great hardware. The app feels older than it is, but the gamification kinda works. More fun than staring at the wall!” – Robert “With *gestures around wildly* going on, I’m pouring less of my time into social media and more into a personal blog using a great service called Pika. It’s dead simple to set up and I love how barebones it is.” – Kaleb “Started collecting sports cards, primarily NFL. It’s not something I’ve thought about since I was 14, but it has been a fun distraction. These are two great YouTube channels to get into: Market Movers and Sports Card Investor. And getting in on “breaks” on Whatnot, where you buy into a live box opening, is some fun entertainment.” – Travis “I’ve been reading Richard II, which feels of a piece with the moment, and due to which I discovered how much more complicated sideloading a Gutenberg ebook to a Kindle is than it should be. The right format wasn’t the one labeled for Kindles!” – Jeanne “I’ve been playing a lot of Maestro lately on my Quest 2. It’s such an amazing and immersive experience. If you ever wanted to feel like an orchestra conductor, this is as close as you can get (unless you’re an actual orchestra conductor, in which case, congrats, such a cool job!).” – Gonzalo So I have this Apple Watch. It’s fine, I like it, whatever, but I’d rather wear another watch. So I went down a YouTube rabbit hole: can you turn an Apple Watch into a standalone, pocketable device that works even when it’s not on your wrist? Turns out, you can! There are a lot of good ideas out there, but I’m basically just following the ideas in this video from Jose Briones. (I’m also intrigued by the TinyPod, but that one doesn’t seem to be very good.) I’m turning my Watch into basically a teeny-tiny iPod and backup communications device that I carry around like a pocket watch. It’s silly, but it’s fun. And it works!  See you in two weeks!  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly. The Verge is a vox media network © 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

            "content": "When I imagine the future of American politics I see Elon Musk’s grinning face as he gives away a million bucks on stage before a crowd of clapping people. Musk is approaching politics the way a YouTuber like MrBeast approaches audience engagement. Both men are giving away huge cash prizes to get people to tune in, and they’re ignoring the legality and consequences of their actions. Over the weekend, Musk handed out oversized novelty $1 million checks to two voters in Pennsylvania. During a ceremony filmed and broadcast on X, the billionaire gave away the cash to voters who signed a petition he’s peddling in support of the constitution. John Dreher, the first million-dollar winner, is a self-professed huge Musk fan. “Actually meeting Elon, I kind of forgot about the money for a little bit,” Dreher said in a video on X. “He’s such an influential figure for guys my age who are working hard every day.” “When he came on stage it was so exciting,” Kristine Fishell, the second million-dollar winner, said in her own video on X. “He did the jump like he did at the Butler rally, it was just really fun to see.” The videos are striking because they feel more like entertainment than politics. In America, the two have long gone hand in hand, but Musk giving away cash prizes to registered voters and making them sit down to film testimonials afterward feels like a generational shift. These are the kinds of videos that would fit well on the feed of a YouTuber like MrBeast who gives away huge cash prizes for people who compete in games where they suffer and humiliate themselves. These two Pennsylvania residents received $1 million each from Elon Musk for signing a petition in support of the First and Second Amendments! 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/eef2a8C9ht — DogeDesigner (@cb_doge) October 20, 2024  Musk has been heavily involved in the U.S. presidential election since the attempted assassination of Trump in July. He started a pro-Trump super PAC and injected $75 million of his own cash, repeatedly posted his support for Trump online, and appeared with the candidate at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. But the billionaire’s latest scheme may violate campaign finance law. He’s giving one lucky voter in a swing state who signs his petition $1 million per day, every day, until the election. What’s the petition? It’s simple. “The First and Second Amendments guarantee freedom of speech and the right to bear arms. By signing below, I am pledging my support for the First and Second Amendments,” it says. Any registered voter who signs on the dotted line gets $47 bucks and is entered for a chance to win the $1 million. The cash is only available to some voters. “This program is exclusively open to registered voters in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. Expires October 21,” the petition says. If you’re wondering if this is legal, you’re not alone. On Sunday, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro called out Musk’s scheme on Meet the Press. “Musk obviously has a right to be able to express his views. He’s made it very, very clear that he supports Donald Trump. I don’t. Obviously we have a difference of opinion,” Shapiro said. “I don’t deny him that, right, but when you start flowing this kind of money into politics, I think it raises serious questions.” Rick Hansen, a legal scholar at the UCLA School of Law, called out Musk’s giveaway on his Election Law Blog. Hansen’s view? “This one is clearly illegal,” Hansen said of the $1 million giveaway. Hansen pointed to section 52 U.S.C. 10307(c) of U.S. election law and page 44 of the Justice Department’s Election Crimes Manual. “For an offer or a payment to violate Section 10307(c), it must have been intended to induce or reward the voter for engaging in one or more acts necessary to cast a ballot,” the manual said. The matter isn’t clear-cut. The money and prizes are for signing a petition, but the petition is thinly veiled and covered in language about registered voters. In their videos, both Fishell and Dreher emphasized the importance of voting and voting early. It’s clear to anyone watching that the cash prizes aren’t just rewards for the petition, but monetary incentives to get out the vote. What will come of this? Will Musk be prosecuted? I think that will largely depend on the outcome of the Presidential election. But one thing I know for sure: the future of American politics will have more MrBeast-style stunts. \nDonald Trumpelection 2024Elon Muskmr. beast  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The head of one of the world's largest oil companies has had it with government flip-flopping.\n         \n          The why and how of leaving X.

            "content": "League of Legends maker Riot Games and French animation studio Fortiche are days away from releasing the first batch of episodes from the second and final season of their Emmy award-winning animated series, Arcane, on Netflix. While the show has garnered accolades for its stunning visuals, riveting storytelling, and being a safe alternative to experiencing the lore of the game’s mythos without dealing with its players, the Netflix series also has the distinction of being the most expensive shows of all time. The price tag for Arcane’s 18 episodes comes out to a cool 250 million dollars. According to a report from Variety, Riot Games is struggling to progress deeper into the entertainment industry because it spent so much money getting Arcane out the door. Much of this liminality is due to the company’s inexperience in navigating the industry. This experience led the company to spend $60 million reportedly on the marketing for Arcane‘s first season, a price tag that Variety notes far exceeds the norm for a show not being distributed by its studio. Another interesting wrinkle of the Variety report is that Arcane was initially billed as a five-season show. While Netflix’s announcement that the upcoming second season would see the conclusion of its storyline between protagonists Vi and Jinx came as a shock to fans, things start to make a bit more sense when you look at how much money was collectively being put into the show’s 40-minute episodes. A source close to the show’s production tells Variety production estimated the costs for Arcane‘s first nine episodes to be north of $80 million. Those same sources peg Arcane‘s similarly-sized second season cost around $100 million. Furthermore, Variety’s report revealed that Riot paid for Arcane‘s marketing out of its pocket, and spent more than Netflix did promoting the show, key among them being an expensive takeover of the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai. According to Variety, Arcane season 2 is estimated to have cost far less than its predecessor, though that isn’t saying much when you consider their lengthy tab. Just when you think Riot couldn’t have spend any more excessive amounts of money to make the show fans know today, it turns out they’d spent a fortune not making a project as well. In 2020, Riot Games initially sought to bring Anthony and Joe Russo of Avengers fame to work on a film set in the League of Legends world. The project never materialized however, resultingt in Riot having to pay the Russo brothers $5 million to walk away from the film because they didn’t want to move forward with a script that was attached to their agreement. Variety couched this revelation with the ambitious claim from then-Riot CEO Nicolo Laurent, who, in a previous interview, boasted that he was building the “entertainment company of the 21st century. Variety would go on to posit that, for all the spending Riot Games made with Arcane, it doesn’t have much else to show for it. Regardless, Riot co-founder Marc Merril posted through the financial losses in an emailed response to Variety, doubling down on the studio’s Hollywood ambitions. “Our ambitions in entertainment in entertainment haven’t changed. We were never intending to operate like a traditional studio with traditional timelines. What did change as we learned more was our expectations of ourselves: We realized that getting it right takes a lot more time than we’d originally expected, and so we recalibrated our development, output goals and teams with that in mind.” Although Merill declined to confirm the $250 million price of Arcane to Variety, he continued, saying: “We’re more than comfortable with the spend it took to deliver a show that was worthy of our players’ time.” While Riot Games still has projects in development like a live-action limited series and a feature animation project, the company has yet to put any of them into production. What the company has done, which Merrill failed to mention in its “restructuring“—which, unsurprisingly led to a disconnect between the entertainment team and the rest of the company—also resulted in two rounds of mass layoffs this year. The first saw Riot lay off 530 employees in January, and an additional 32 workers in October. “As part of these changes, we’ve made the tough decision to eliminate some roles. This isn’t about reducing headcount to save money—it’s about making sure we have the right expertise so that League continues to be great for another 15 years and beyond,” Merill wrote in an October Twitter post. Arcane season 2 would release across November in three acts. Act one will release November 9, Act two November 16, and Act three on November 23. Want more io9 news?

            "content": "In the latest news of surprise business acquisitions and mergers that make sense at first glance, Toho Animation, the self-proclaimed leader in Japanese entertainment, has announced its acquisition of Gkids, a North American animation producer and distributor. Earlier today, Gkids published a press release describing its acquisition by the Los Angeles-based Toho as one where Toho would acquire 100% equity from Gkids. At the same time, the other would maintain its independence (and folks in power as CEOs and whatnot) while utilizing Toho’s connections to bolster its commerce and further its reach in the entertainment world. What does all that mean to the average fan of Japanese entertainment and anime? Two mega powers in the industry are combining forces to compete against other companies that are jockeying for our precious attention, such as Disney. A key motivator behind Toho and Gkids’ partnership is the winning success both companies experienced at the box office this past year with Godzilla Minus One and Hayao Miyazaki’s The Boy and the Heron. As Gkids states in its press release, both films earned significant achievements within a week of each other, with the former earning the highest box office revenue for a Japanese live-action film in the states and the third largest-grossing foreign film in U.S. history, and the latter becoming Studio Ghibli’s highest-grossing film in the U.S. And even beyond that, the two aren’t strangers to one another, having collaborated with the theatrical releases of animated films like Spirited Away: Live on Stage, Makoto Shinkai’s Weathering With You, and animation Studio Trigger’s Promare. Reading between Gkids’ press release lines, the two likely decided to perform a fusion dance of sorts after making their presences felt during the most recent awards season (including the Oscars). To put one’s capitalistic cap on, the two aim to have their combined forces lead to a repeat of their individual successes with the aforementioned award-winning films as a united front. “Gkids will continue to operate as we always have—with the same team, the same passion, and the same mission—but now with the backing of a highly complementary and legendary parent company,” Gkids founder Eric Beckman and president David Jesteadt wrote in a joint statement. “This partnership will empower us to bring even more amazing films to North American and global audiences, while we continue to champion animation as a cinematic artform and push the limits of what the medium is capable of. We could not be more excited about the opportunities in front of us. The best is yet to come.” While Toho has become a household name for many an anime fan thanks to big marquee shonen series like Dragon Ball Z and Jujutsu Kaisen, Gkids has become a bit of a rising star in the cultural zeitgeist. Its North American theatrical distribution and home video releases of Look Back, Dan Da Dan, The First Slam Dunk, and Arcane season one are the most recent money-move examples of Gkids putting itself on the map for fans of Japanese entertainment and animation. Likewise, Toho has been on a future-sighted acquisition spree, recently taking on Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, Dan Da Dan, and Devilman Crybaby animation studio Science Saru. “Through their hard work, vision, and integrity, Gkids has built a unique position in the U.S. market, which dovetails perfectly with Toho’s own strengths and strategic mission,” Toho president and CEO Hiro Matsuoka wrote in the press release. “This partnership accelerates Toho’s goals to prioritize animation, develop international markets, and support IP creation, while bringing exceptional Japanese and animated content to global audiences.” Hopefully, this no-brainer acquisition doesn’t lead to an influx of layoffs across Toho or Gkids, as we’ve seen countless times in the video game industry. In the meantime, the likes of Disney and Netflix can look forward to steep competition at both the box office and during awards season. Want more io9 news?

            "content": "Nvidia has rapidly ascended in the past two years to become the most valuable company on Earth thanks to its highly sought after GPUs for AI processing. But lest we forget, the company first made its name in gaming. To that end, Nvidia today is making some changes to its GeForce Now cloud gaming service. The company is renaming its Priority membership to Performance and adding 1440p streaming as well as support for ultra-widescreen resolutions. Perhaps the most welcome change is that players will now be able to save graphic settings across sessions. GeForce Now is Nvidia’s answer to cloud gaming and competes with Xbox Game Pass and perhaps Steam Remote Play as an offering that opens up access to triple AAA games to more players by making them accessible regardless of whether a player has high-end hardware. GeForce Now comes with a monthly subscription fee and players also need to bring their own games. In a world where streaming services are constantly increasing in price, Nvidia is preserving GeForce Now’s existing pricing, with one caveat: Players are now limited to 100 hours of playtime per month, which comes out to about 3 hours each day. Up to 15 hours of unused playtime automatically rolls over to the next month. Performance users can purchase an additional 15 hours for $2.99 while Ultimate users will need to pay $5.99 (Ultimate offers higher-resolution gaming). Nvidia says that only 6% of players ever hit the 100-hour limit. But even if the price of GeForce Now isn’t increasing, the service is becoming a worse proposition over time. Gamers are already suspicious of cloud gaming because of the latency involved in sending actions back and forth to a server somewhere else. On top of that, you are now limited in how often you can play. It makes cloud gaming a tougher sell and is an indirect price hike. Interestingly, for a company that netted nearly $17 billion in profit in its last quarter thanks to its AI chipsets, Nvidia says that the GeForce Now cap is being put in place to avoid increasing membership prices in the foreseeable future. It feels a bit disingenuous, but alas, Nvidia is not a charity and corporations are going to seek profit wherever they can. It’s a pretty similar story that has played out across the entire landscape of streaming entertainment. Services start at a very attractive price that slowly over time trickles up, content is removed randomly for licensing reasons, and people are left looking at their bank statements to discover their monthly spending on subscriptions has ballooned. Entertainment companies like Apple and Warner Bros, the owner of Max, have begun trying to bundle services together in the interest of reducing cancellations as consumers feel fatigued by it all. \nCloud gamingGamingNvidia  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Emulator designers spend years creating an environment where you can enjoy games you can't buy anymore.

This whopping 40% discount marks a record low price for this popular tablet and matches the Prime Day offer from October but with one crucial difference – this deal is accessible to all shoppers, not just Prime members. See iPad 9 at Amazon At this record low price point, the iPad 9 becomes an irresistible proposition for anyone in the market for a  powerful tablet within the Apple ecosystem. This deal is so exceptional that it actually makes the iPad 9 cheaper than a pair of AirPods, a fact that underscores the extraordinary value on offer here. Despite being Apple’s entry-level tablet (at least for Apple), the iPad 9 is far from basic. It features a great 10.2-inch Retina display with a resolution of 2160×1620 pixels which is perfect for everything from watching movies to creating digital art. Under the hood, it’s powered by the A13 Bionic chip – the same processor that can be found in the iPhone 11 to ensure smooth performance for multitasking, gaming and running demanding apps. With iPadOS, users can run multiple apps simultaneously which makes it a viable alternative to a laptop for many tasks. The tablet supports the first-generation Apple Pencil (sold separately) and turns it into an excellent tool for note-taking or precise photo editing. For students and professionals, the iPad 9 is a compelling package. If you’re just looking for entertainment, this tactile tablet is also great. What’s also great is it all-day battery life which let you work (or study) without constantly worrying about finding a power outlet. Also note the 12MP Ultra Wide front camera with Center Stage technology keeps you perfectly framed during video calls. It’s probably not the best (it isn’t either on the latest MacBook Pros), but it’s enough for remote work. At $199 instead of $329 for early Black Friday on Amazon, the 9th generation iPad isn’t just a good deal – it’s an extraordinary one. It combines performance, versatility and value that’s hard to match. Whether you’re a student, a professional or simply someone looking for a high-quality tablet for entertainment and everyday tasks, this deal is one you won’t want to miss.

This early Black Friday deal has slashed the price to just $34 down from its original $69.99 which marks a record low for the game since its release. See at Amazon This substantial price drop comes as a pleasant surprise for football fans and gamers alike especially considering that EA Sports FC 25 hit the shelves only a few months ago, in September. The game represents EA’s first foray into football simulation without the FIFA branding and it has been met with positive reviews for its enhanced gameplay mechanics and improved graphics. The discount applies to both the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 versions as well as the Xbox Series X|S edition (not available on PCs) and makes it an excellent opportunity for players across multiple console generations to experience the latest installment in this beloved franchise. This deal is attractive for those who may have been hesitant to purchase the game at full price or were waiting for a significant discount before making their move. EA Sports FC 25 brings several new features to the table including enhanced HyperMotion V technology for more realistic player movements, an improved Ultimate Team mode and updated player rosters reflecting the latest transfers in the football world. The game also introduces the new Evolutions feature in Ultimate Team that allows players to upgrade their favorite footballers over time. The timing of this deal, coming well ahead of the traditional Black Friday sales period, suggests that retailers and publishers are eager to capture the holiday shopping market early.

When you do need to juice it back up, its fast charging feature ensures you’ll be back to full power in less than 90 minutes. To top it all off, its internal Exynos chipset is powerful enough to handle anything you throw at it, and if you multitask like the rest of us, that could me many things at one given time. One of the coolest additions to the package is the included S Pen that lets you write notes by hand, draw, or mark up documents in a way that mimics writing on actual paper. That makes it the perfect “digital notebook” or a great way to doodle if you’re in a creative field and want to share ideas – or just make some art. If you’re ready to snag a great little tablet, don’t pass up on this deal (27% off). It won’t be on sale for long, and the holidays are right around the corner.

            "content": "Though Redbox, the DVD vending machine company, is officially dead, the company’s disc-dispensing kiosks are still strewn all over America. The machines still work and there are still hundreds of DVDs inside of them. Lately, those machines have been getting sold off to various hardware enthusiasts who have, in turn, been reverse-engineering them to figure out how they work, and to dispense the movies trapped inside. Well, with one exception: Twister. 404 Media reports that, for some weird reason, the army of amateur hardware enthusiasts who have been futzing with the company’s machines cannot figure out how to get the 1996 disaster flick out of them. To illuminate this bizarre conundrum, 404 cites a series of Reddit threads and Discord communities where the hardware pros have been posting about the issue. “Sorry, there was a problem with the purchased items in your cart. Please remove these items from your cart in order to continue,” an alert from the kiosk reads, whenever someone tries to rent Twister. This issue impacts “seemingly every Redbox kiosk and is not happening with any other movie,” the outlet writes. 404 Media writes that the machine’s refusal to dispense Twister “appears to be either a licensing dispute or software bug.” The outlet further states that one of the prevailing theories is that “Redbox’s licensing agreement for Twister ran out ahead of the release of its sequel, Twisters, and there is a hard-coded date where checking out with Twister in your cart was disabled.” That said, 404 notes nobody has been able to confirm this. Redbox swept onto the video rental scene in the early aughts, not long before the industry’s mom-and-pop store paradigm would be disrupted by the advent of Netflix and video streaming. Originally an offshoot of McDonald’s, the company expanded aggressively in the years after its founding. At one point, Redbox surpassed Blockbuster as the largest video rental retailer in the country. Now, of course, that’s all over, thanks to the dominance of streaming. Two years ago, a subsidiary of the company that publishes the Chicken Soup for the Soul self-help book series bought Redbox. Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment took on $325 million in debt when it acquired the company, with the plan of reinventing the ailing business. Instead, the company wracked up an enormous amounts of debt and was forced to file for bankruptcy this past August. As part of the bankruptcy deal, Redbox had to be liquidated. The Verge reports that when Chicken Soup filed for bankruptcy this summer, it had been “sued over a dozen times over unpaid bills.” \nRedboxtwister  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Hackers reveal the old Redbox kiosks can be easily hacked for users' names and some financial info.

            "content": "Over five years ago, Samara Weaving and directors Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin (aka Radio Silence) delivered Ready or Not, a horror-comedy film a lot of people liked. While all three of them have been busy since then, Weaving’s said she’s more than happy for another go, and there’s been rumblings (and hopes) throughout this year of a potential sequel. According to the Hollywood Reporter, it’s time to get excited, because Ready or Not 2 is now fully a-go. Samara will be back in the lead role, and Radio Silence will once again direct, working off a script by returning writers Guy Busick and R. Christopher Murray. What’s the sequel gonna be about? Not a clue, and it’s not even clear if Weaving will play her character from the original film. But hey, it’s just good to know it’ll actually be happening, right? If you haven’t seen it yet, Ready or Not centered on Weaving’s Grace, who opens the film just married to the son of a wealthy family. On the night of their wedding, Grace and her new in-laws play Hide n Seek, but it turns out to be much more than what it sounds: if anyone finds her before the night is over, they will legitimately kill her as part of a ritual believed to be the continued source of the family’s wealth. With her new family trying to off her or turn on each other, Grace starts picking up skills to live through the night and eventually go on the offensive. This was a big money maker for Searchlight at the time; it made $57.6 million worldwide on a $6 million budget, and it had a pretty good life in the home entertainment scene. It also gave a big profile boost to its three central players: Radio Silence’s continued horror presence with the Scream sequels and most recently Abigail, while Weaving’s become a big star in her own right. If things have finally aligned for them to do another of these, then let’s goooooooooo. Expect more coverage on Ready or Not 2 as we learn it. Want more io9 news?

            "content": "As Gambit said, he’s about to make a name for himself. Channing Tatum’s appearance in Deadpool & Wolverine was one of the film’s biggest surprises, mostly because the actor had never played the character before. He’d tried though. Oh, boy, had he tried. Tatum spent the better part of a decade working with directors and writers in attempts to bring the card-throwing Cajun to the big screen but could never get across the line. But, according to co-star Ryan Reynolds, he just needed a chance. “I honestly don’t know what goes on behind closed doors in the bookkeeping sessions at Marvel, but I do know that they’re obsessed with him in that role,” Reynolds said to Entertainment Weekly. “It’s kind of like the same situation I went through. Once you show that it works well, that’s really what they need. Sometimes they just need to see it in action.” Reynolds is referring to the moment in July 2014 (around the same time Tatum began working on Gambit, actually) when “leaked” footage of him playing Deadpool hit the internet. The footage exploded, Fox finally saw the potential in the character and the rest is history. So basically Reynolds thinks, with Deadpool & Wolverine showing what Tatum had in mind with the character, and how audiences reacted, the powers that be may, finally, be okay with giving him more to do. If that were to happen though, it certainly wouldn’t be for some time. Marvel Studios has plenty on its plate for the next several years, mainly the conclusion of the Multiverse Saga with films leading to Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars in 2026 and 2027. But most fans expect mutants to be on the table after that—and, well, what better time for Gambit to get out of the Void and make a name for himself in the MCU? Do you think a Channing Tatum Gambit movie will actually happen? And did his appearance in Deadpool & Wolverine have the same impact as the Deadpool footage leak? Sound off below.

This 40% discount marks the lowest price ever for this good Apple tablet and the record-low briefly seen during Prime Day sales earlier this week. But unlike Prime Day, this deal is available to everyone, not just Prime members. See at Amazon While not the latest model, the 9th generation iPad remains a highly capable device. It features a 10.2-inch Retina display that offers bright colors for all your viewing needs and it is powered by the A13 Bionic chip to ensures smooth performance for everyday tasks. With 64GB of storage, it provides ample space for apps, photos, videos and documents. One of the most significant upgrades from its predecessor is the 12MP Ultra Wide front camera which supports Center Stage. This feature automatically pans and zooms to keep subjects centered in the frame during video calls and makes it ideal for remote work or online learning. The iPad 9 is compatible with the first-generation Apple Pencil and enhances its usability for digital art and note-taking. Its Smart Connector allows for easy attachment of keyboards and boosts productivity for tasks like writing emails or working on documents. With up to 10 hours of battery life, the iPad 9 can easily last through a full day of use. Whether you’re streaming videos, browsing the web or working on projects, you won’t need to worry about frequent charging. It’s perfectly suitable for students, professionals and casual users alike; it can serve as an e-reader, a portable entertainment device, a digital canvas or even a secondary display for your Mac. This deal presents an rare and great opportunity for anyone in need of a reliable tablet to enter or upgrade within the Apple ecosystem at a fraction of the usual cost (40% is insane!). Deals of this magnitude on Apple products are exceedingly rare; Apple is known for maintaining strict control over its pricing and rarely offers discounts in its own stores. At $199, this iPad offers incredible value and versatility. If you’ve been considering an iPad purchase, now is the time to act. This deal is likely part of Amazon’s efforts to clear out inventory after Prime Day and is not expected to last long (it should expire latest on Sunday). Once this weekend passes, it’s unlikely we’ll see prices this low again until Black Friday.

            "content": "Deadline reports Chris Hemsworth is in talks to star in Prince Charming, a new project at Disney from Paddington and Wonka director Paul King. Prince Charming is based on a script co-written by King with Simon Farnaby and Jon Croker; the exact nature and details of the story are currently under wraps, but unless it reveals itself to be a simple rom-com utilizing the name like The Perfect Man or The Idea of You, the story likely concerns some variation of the stock character seen in Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel, and other Disney fairy tales. As the outlet notes, “insiders do add that the film will not specifically be linked to Cinderella,” and so will likely not be a retelling of the Disney movie from the perspective of its royal shoe-obsessed love interest.   Entertainment insider Jeff Sneider broke news of the project and Hemsworth’s involvement in his newsletter last week, so the Deadline report is further confirmation that this movie is real and moving forward. Which begs the question: if it’s not specifically about Cinderella’s himbo, what’s it about? And why is Disney interested? Perhaps Prince Charming really will be some sort of essay on the stock character, in a similar vein to Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, with Hemsworth as some sort of bumbling incarnation of the trope—similar to Ryan Gosling’s evergreen portrayal of Ken. Perhaps it’ll be a sort of modern retelling of The Stepford Husbands, the 1996 made-for-TV sequel to The Stepford Wives with Mr. Hemsworth standing in for Michael Ontkean. How are ideal storybook men made, and for what purpose? Will Hemsworth’s Charming become self-aware and lead a revolution of his colleagues as they question why they’re cursed to play second fiddle to their princess counterparts? We’ll find out soon enough. Want more io9 news?

            "content": "Warner Bros. Discovery under the guiding hand of CEO David Zaslav has made a series of puzzling decisions that seem antithetical to meeting fan demands. Key among its highlight reel of letdowns include unceremoniously canceling daring animated show Scavengers Reign and scrapping the completed Batgirl film for tax write-offs. While Warner Bros. has often opted to breeze past its lowlights as a natural part of the entertainment business, Zaslav owned up to the fact that Todd Phillips’ Joker: Folie à Deux was a big letdown. Earlier today, in a Warner Bros. earnings call (first reported by IGN), Zaslav singled out the sequel while expressing his disappointment in the company’s uneven theatrical performance. “Inconsistency also remains an issue at our motion picture studio, as reinforced recently by the disappointing results of Joker 2,” Zaslav said. Zaslav’s comments come following Joker 2 bombing at the box office. On its opening weekend, the gritty DC musical made $37.8 million; it’s since grossed less than $60 million domestically. Suffice it to say, not many people went out of their way to watch Joker 2 in theaters. This isn’t helped by the fact that the film earned a CinemaScore of D, the lowest grade given to a comic book movie. To put things into context, the previous title holder was Fantastic Four, which earned a C-. Even grading on the curve of its 2019 Oscar-winning predecessor, which has 68% positivity from critics and 89% from fans on Rotten Tomatoes, Joker 2 currently sits at 32% from both groups. When put against the film’s outlandish $200 million budget, it wasn’t surprising to witness the movie swiftly receive a digital and video-on-demand release a little over two weeks after its October 29 theatrical release. As IGN notes, Warner Bros. Discovery reported its Q3 revenue of $9.6 billion, which for the pedestrians among us means the media conglomerate is down 3% year-over-year. Likewise, its theatrical revenue is down 40% year-over-year. According to IGN, this financial dip is due to the lower box office performance of films like Beetlejuice Beetlejuice and Twisters against the success of 2023’s Barbie. IGN also reports that Warner Bros. Discovery is “substantially underperforming” in gaming as well. In short, things aren’t looking too hot for the company. In io9’s review, we wrote “Joker: Folie à Deux is less about Arthur than it’s a stand-in for him. It’s a movie and a character that isn’t quite sure what it wants to be, or even what it is, so it messes around and ultimately decides it doesn’t want to be anything at all. At least the first Joker left you with some things to think about. Here you’re just left frustrated at everything that could have been or never was.” Not everyone is down on Joker 2, however. The film has found supporters in folks like Quentin Tarantino and Death Stranding game developer Hideo Kojima, who thinks the film will be looked upon fondly in the next decade. I watched \"Joker: Folie à Deux.” The beginning of the film is an animation sequence, reminiscent of the nostalgic \"Looney Tunes\", depicting a story of Joker and Joker’s shadow. In the trial that follows, the question of his multiple personality is argued from beginning to end.

            "content": "It’s no secret that Mattel laughed all the way to the bank last year thanks to the humongous box office success of director Greta Gerwig and actor Margot Robbie’s Barbie movie. While some of its success could be credited to the cinematic phenomenon known as Barbenheimer, Mattel—like any self-respecting company that sees no ceiling to the potential financial success of repeating a past idea—was soon back at work trying to decide which toy to turn into a movie next. Lo and behold, the bigwigs have finally arrived at their answer: the View-Master. No, we’re not kidding. According to Variety, Mattel is officially working on a live-action film about its 1940s-era 3D stereoscopic toy in collaboration with Sony Pictures and Escape Artists (the folks behind The Equalizer 3 and Mattel’s long-delayed live-action Masters of the Universe Amazon film). This next sentence would typically be the place were we’d write about noteworthy directors, writers, and actors tasked with breathing life into this expensive advertisement of a film, but there’s are none as of time of publication. It’s just View-Master. Same as it ever was. Be that as it may, the View-Master movie’s current lack of enticing names attached to it hasn’t hampered Mattel Films president Robbie Brenner and Escape Artist producer Todd Black’s excitement. “View-Master has inspired generations to embark on boundless adventures, offering a treasure trove of storytelling possibilities for this film,” Brenner said. “We’re thrilled to work with Sony Pictures Entertainment and Escape Artists’ Todd Black to bring this Mattel franchise to life. Their creative and filmmaking expertise sets the stage to introduce a modern take on this beloved toy to audiences everywhere.” “View-Master has long been a window to the wonders of the world, sparking imagination in kids and adults alike,” Black echoed. “Teaming up with Robbie Brenner and Mattel Films gives us the chance to honor that legacy while creating an entirely new adventure for today’s audience. We can’t wait to bring this treasured toy’s sense of exploration to the big screen.” While the View-Master movie isn’t the most enticing title to announce ahead of New York Comic Con, Mattel does have other projects down the pipeline that are more exciting and have names attached to them. Key among them include a Hot Wheels movie with director J.J. Abrams attached; a live-action Barney movie starring Nope and Get Out‘s Daniel Kaluuya; a Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots movie with Vin Diesel; and an Uno-inspired “action heist movie” involving rapper Lil Yachty. For Mattel’s sake, here’s hoping any combination of these disparate projects bring in beaucoup bucks like Barbie did. Who do you think should star in the View-Master movie? Want more io9 news?

One of the key advantages of the Fire TV Stick ecosystem is its integration with Amazon’s broader services. Prime members can enjoy seamless access to Prime Video content, while the interface prominently features Amazon’s channels and rental services. However, the platform remains open, hosting apps from competing services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. For cord-cutters or those looking to enhance their TV viewing experience, these early Black Friday deals on Fire TV Sticks are an excellent opportunity. Whether you’re upgrading an older TV in a guest room with the HD model, enhancing your main living room TV with the 4K version or opting for the top-of-the-line 4K Max for the ultimate streaming experience, there’s a Fire TV Stick to suit every need and budget.

            "content": "On the whole, Netflix’s movies are not very good. Sure, it has released a number of films by prestige filmmakers over the years (flicks by Martin Scorsese, David Fincher, the Coen brothers and Richard Linklater all spring to mind) but, when it comes to the platform’s median viewing experience, those movies tend to be outliers. More often than not, the movies that the streaming juggernaut produces are low-budget, poorly written, barely entertaining pieces of crap that function better as ambient background noise for household chores than engrossing cinematic experiences you actually want to watch. However, according to a new report from Bloomberg, the streaming platform has a new plan to turn all that around. The new strategy is this: make fewer movies so that the ones that do get made aren’t shitty. Dan Lin, Netflix’s film chairman, is trying to ditch the platform’s content mill model, and plans to cut the streamer’s annual output down to 25 to 30 movies per year (the company’s current output is around 50 flicks a year). The streaming service still plans to release what it calls a “tentpole” (read: big budget) feature once every quarter, though, overall, the goal is to bring “costs under control” at the company. Bloomberg writes that, to execute this vision, Lin has “restructured Netflix’s film division,” cutting some staff positions while refocusing others. Under this new system, individual executives are now in charge of certain genres, allowing for tighter focus on particular types of content: “Ori Marmur oversees action and sci-fi, while Niija Kuykendall handles faith-based projects, as well as holiday and young-adult fare. Kira Goldberg handles dramas and thrillers. Lin also hired a couple of veteran studio executives in Doug Belgrad and Hannah Minghella, both formerly of Sony, to help run the show.” This is certainly a change. Previous to Lin, Netflix’s film division was run by an executive named Scott Stuber who, as Variety puts it, had one clear mandate: “quantity, not quality.” In the six years that Stuber ran Netflix’s film strategy, the streamer pumped out a veritable tsunami of movies, some of which were good but many of which were deeply, deeply terrible. Stuber left Netflix in March to pursue a career in film producing, clearing the way for Lin to take the reins and begin pivoting the company’s overall content strategy. Does this mean that Netflix will stop greenlighting stuff like Tall Girl 2 and Hubie Halloween and begin producing fare that better resembles the Hollywood hits of yesteryear? It’s unclear. I’d personally prefer it if Netflix didn’t exist at all, as that would allow all the attention, investment, and talent currently being hoarded by the streamer to be channeled back into the traditional film industry. That said, as long as Netflix does exist and continues to dominate the entertainment industry, it sure would be great if the majority of the movies that it produced were watchable instead of unwatchable. \nNetflix  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The Netflix series set in the League of Legends universe just released the first three episodes of its new season.\n         \n          Adi Shankar, producer of several Netflix game adaptations, wanted to try and revive the fan-favorite Dino Crisis series for Netflix.\n         \n          io9 debuts \"Enter the Sekai Tekai,\" the first single from the new album by composers Leo Birenberg and Zach Robinson.\n         \n          Riot Games' Christian Linke preaches the good word of the medium and dishes on his hopes for League of Legends' future in television.\n         \n          Both seasons of Netflix's League of Legends show cost Riot Games $250 million to make.\n         \nStranger Things 5, the final season of the hit Netflix show, is coming in 2025.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

This year, there’s an opportunity to get ahead of the game and set yourself up for significant savings with a Costco Gold Star membership: StackSocial is currently offering a deal that’s hard to resist: a one-year Costco Gold Star membership for just $65, sweetened with a $45 digital gift card. It’s like getting your membership for a mere $20. See at StackSocial This offer is a substantial upgrade from StackSocial’s summer promotion which only included a $20 gift card. The current deal more than doubles that bonus and gives you $45 to spend on anything from Costco’s vast inventory – perhaps even 30 of their famous $1.50 hot dogs, a price point that’s become legendary for its immutability. A Costco Gold Star membership is your key to unlocking savings at over 600 locations across the United States and more than 900 worldwide. This card grants you access to Costco’s treasure trove of deals including their business centers, travel services, gas stations, hearing aid centers, optical departments, pharmacies and their extensive online store. The membership extends its benefits to your household and allows you to share the savings with family members. For those looking to maximize their Costco experience, the Executive membership is available at $130 on StackSocial and offers additional perks and greater discounts on select Costco services. Executive members enjoy benefits like lower prices on check printing and complimentary roadside assistance through the auto insurance program. Perhaps most enticing is the annual 2% reward on qualified Costco purchases up to $1,250. Both membership tiers come with the $45 digital Costco shop card which will be emailed within two weeks of successful redemption. This digital credit isn’t restricted to a single use and you’ll be able to spread your savings across multiple purchases. It’s important to note that this offer is exclusive to new members or those whose memberships have lapsed for more than 18 months. With access to Costco’s competitive pricing on everything from electronics to groceries, members are poised to make substantial savings during the biggest shopping event of the year. The warehouse giant is known for its Black Friday deals often beating out competitors like Amazon or Walmart on popular items like TVs, laptops, and home appliances. Moreover, Costco’s year-round low prices mean that even outside of major sales events, members can consistently save on everyday purchases. From bulk groceries to discounted gift cards for restaurants and entertainment, the potential for savings extends far beyond the holiday season. For those concerned about the upfront cost, it’s worth considering the long-term savings potential. Regular Costco shoppers often find that their membership pays for itself through accumulated savings over the year. With the added $45 gift card in this offer, the break-even point comes even sooner.

            "content": "\nThis article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.\n      We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site.\n     Samsung has launched its early Black Friday sale this Sunday and it is offering huge discounts on its flagship Galaxy S24 Ultra (but also on foldable phones like Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6). This premium smartphone is known for its cutting-edge features and impressive performance is now available at prices that are hard to resist. The standout deal focuses on the Galaxy S24 Ultra 512GB model which typically retails for $1,419. Thanks to Samsung’s “instant savings” deal, this high-capacity version is now priced at just $999 which is a substantial $420 discount on selected colors. What makes this offer particularly appealing is Samsung’s “double storage on us” initiative, which essentially means you’re getting the 512GB model for the same price as the 256GB version. See at Samsung.com For those considering the base 256GB model, originally priced at $1,299, it’s now available for $999 as well. However, given that the 512GB variant is offered at the same price point, opting for the higher storage capacity is clearly the smarter choice. This strategy by Samsung effectively renders the 256GB model obsolete in this sale as it provides customers with twice the storage at no extra cost. The deals get even more enticing for those willing to trade in their old devices: with Samsung’s trade-in program, customers can save up to an additional $800 which brings the price of the 512GB Galaxy S24 Ultra down to an astonishing $499 instead of $1,419. This trade-in value varies depending on the model and condition of the device being exchanged but it presents an excellent opportunity for users looking to upgrade from older smartphones. To sweeten the deal further, Samsung is offering 1.5% back in Samsung Rewards Points on these purchases. This adds extra value for customers who frequently shop with Samsung, as these points can be used for future purchases. The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra itself is a technological marvel and boasts features that justify its flagship status. It comes equipped with a powerful processor for smooth performance for even the most demanding applications. The device’s camera system is one of its standout features and offers professional-grade photography capabilities in a pocket-sized form. The 512GB storage capacity is particularly beneficial for users who capture a lot of high-resolution photos and videos or those who like to keep a large library of apps and media on their devices. With this amount of storage, concerns about running out of space become a thing of the past for most users. Samsung’s S Pen is included with the Ultra model is perfect for note-taking, drawing and precise navigation. We also love the vibrant display of the S24 Ultra which makes it ideal for both productivity and entertainment purposes. This early Black Friday deal from Samsung represents a significant opportunity for those in the market for a top-tier smartphone. The combination of instant savings, doubled storage, and potential trade-in values makes this one of the most attractive offers on the Galaxy S24 Ultra to date. If you’re interested, you should act quickly, as these Black Friday deals are typically time-sensitive and stock may be limited, especially for the most popular color options.

What’s more, these deals are now accessible to everyone, including non-Prime members, which makes it an ideal time for everyone to take advantage of significant savings. See all deals at Amazon US See all deals at Amazon UK Top deals for Tuesday: See all deals at Amazon Despite the official end of Prime Day (Oct. 8-9), Amazon keeps on offering massive discounts across a wide range of products. You’ll be pleased to find that popular Apple items are still available at reduced prices: the AirPods Pro 2 remain priced at $199 ($50 reduction from their original $249 price tag). Similarly, the 9th generation iPad is still 32% off and a 4-pack of AirTags can still be snagged for $79. Amazon’s own lineup of devices continues to see price cuts. Echo speakers and Ring security cameras are still available with discounts ranging from 40% to 70%. This extended sale period also encompasses a variety of other product categories, including audio equipment from premium brands like Sony and Bose. Home appliances and gaming consoles such as the PS5 Standard and Digital Edition remain part of the deal roster. Additionally, a range of beauty products and toys are still available at discounted rates on this Tuesday, one week after Prime Day. See all deals at Amazon Lego enthusiasts have not been left out of this extended promotional period of Prime Day: the Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar continues to be available at a 20% discount (top seller on the platform) which makes it an attractive option for those looking to add a touch of galactic fun to their holiday countdown. The Lego Harry Potter Castle is now priced at $135 down from its original $169 and it is also very popular. While Amazon extends its promotional period, other retailers are not sitting idle. Samsung is offering significant discounts on its latest technology through its official store. This includes special deals and trade-in offers on new Galaxy S24 smartphones and the Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 foldable models, with potential savings exceeding $1,000 for trade-ins. As this extension of Prime Day deals continues, stock levels for very popular items are becoming a concern. High-demand products like the MacBook Pro, AirPods Max and certain headphone models from Beats and Bose have already sold out. You should act quickly as some more might run out of stock by the end of the day. In a departure from the typical Prime Day format, these extended deals are now accessible to all shoppers regardless of Prime membership status. This democratization of discounts provides an good opportunity for non-Prime members to enjoy savings reserved for subscribers. While this extended Prime Day sale period offers substantial savings, Black Friday is on the horizon. Savvy shoppers might consider this an opportunity to get a head start on holiday shopping and potentially avoid the rush and stock issues often associated with Black Friday sales.

            "content": "While Peacock has been branching into horror series lately, with Hysteria! and Teacup two recent additions, the streamer also has a big library of movies perfect for Halloween viewing—encompassing classics, franchise staples, obscure titles (Bermuda Tentacles, anyone?), and seasonal favorites. Here are 10 to set the right frightful mood for your next spooky movie night. Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett (Ready or Not, Scream, Scream VI) created their own spin on a Universal Monster with this tale of a tiny ballerina who turns out to be a bloodthirsty vampire—to the gruesome chagrin of the ragtag gang of crooks (including Dan Stevens, Kathryn Newton, and Melissa Barrera) who kidnap her, not realizing that instead of reaping a huge ransom they’ll become her multi-course meal. It’s mid-October—have you had your annual re-watch of The Exorcist III yet? No? Well, lucky for you, Peacock is here to refresh all your nightmares involving garden shears and hospital corridors. Not all film fans have the spirit of Silver Shamrock running through their veins, but for those who appreciate the weird pivot John Carpenter’s blockbuster franchise took in its third installment—no Michael Myers kills, just a diabolical plot involving a toymaker, cursed Halloween masks, and… Stonehenge?—it’s an essential part of spooky season. Are you ready for the big giveaway? Speaking of John Carpenter, one of his most underrated releases is this 1987 oddity that contains an all-star array of actors from other Carpenter projects, and imagines what would happen if Satan’s essence—which looks like the goo inside of a lava lamp—was discovered buried under an aging church in downtown Los Angeles. Nothing good happens to any of the characters, or the world in which Prince of Darkness takes place, but even with some gaping plot holes the movie is screamingly entertaining. When you watch a lot of horror movies, you inevitably start to notice similarities, tropes, and details that hover between homage and blatant rip-off. And then there’s Don Coscarelli’s 1979 Phantasm, a movie that is truly one of a kind, with only its own sequels coming close to replicating its bizarre story and unsettling mood. Two brothers and their pal realize something not right is going down at the local mortuary, and things somehow only get weirder from there. With Terrifier 3 one of horror’s biggest headlines at the moment, there’s no better time to watch writer-director Damien Leone’s favorite movie: the original Black Christmas. So what if it’s early on the calendar? This movie is scary as hell any time of year, with one of the most chilling final scenes of all time. These days we’re used to made-for-TV entertainment in the context of streamers, where nothing is too salacious for audiences. But it’s still stunning to consider Dark Night of the Scarecrow aired on CBS back in 1981, no doubt terrifying viewers with its tale of mob violence in a small town that goes unpunished… until the vengeful spirit of an innocent victim starts getting payback his own way: disguised as a terrifying scarecrow, and using an array of farm-ready implements, including a wood chipper. Deliciously filthy, often offensive, consistently nonsensical, and gory as can be: that’s Pieces, a 1982 murder mystery that also involves an undercover cop posing as a college tennis coach. It’s by Juan Piquer Simón, who also made the inimitable Slugs: The Movie. If you recently watched and enjoyed The Substance, why not chase it with Robert Zemeckis’ diabolically hilarious tale of anti-aging miracles framed by a love triangle gone very wrong? Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn, Bruce Willis, and Isabella Rossellini all give endearingly campy performances, and while the 1992 special effects may look a little dated now, they’re still impressive for the time. Remember back in 2016, when you were on edge worrying about the upcoming presidential election, and The Purge series dropped this anxiety-jabbing satire that dared to use the tag line “Keep America Great”? Well, here we are in 2024—and The Purge: Election Year is still lurking, this time summoning a sense of dreadful déjà vu. Want more io9 news?

Whatever he’s working on next (he also made 2017’s Terrified, and had a segment in 2022 anthology Satanic Hispanics) is already at the top of our must-see list. You know how horror movies are always telling you not to go in the basement? Never was that warning more true than in writer-director Zach Cregger’s 2022 slice of Airbnb horror—which despite using one of the genre’s oldest tropes as a leaping-off point, never goes the direction you think it will. Georgina Campbell is great as the tenacious lead, but extra points also go to Bill Skarsgård and Justin Long for their left-turn supporting performances. David Cronenberg’s 1986 ode to gooey body horror, eccentric genius, the chemistry between Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis, and cheeseburgers is sci-fi horror at its finest, adapting and updating the 1950s classic in all the right ways. Lists of “best Stephen King adaptations” sometimes overlook this 2007 release from writer-director Frank Darabont, which changes the ending of King’s original story with absolutely devastating results. (Unlike, say, Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining, King actually approved of the alteration.) Thomas Jane leads an ensemble cast in this harrowing survival tale set in (where else?) a small Maine town that’s suddenly encased in a fog filled with malevolent creatures. The Antichrist is having a banner 2024, with The First Omen proving that horror prequels can feel original and shocking—even when leading into one of the genre’s most-watched classics. Go back to the beginning with the 1976 original Omen, then learn what happened just before in The First Omen. For additional devilish entertainment, Hulu also has the very best Omen sequel (two words: military school) as part of its library too. Now that lo-fi nightmare-weaver Kyle Edward Ball has announced his second film (no details yet, other than it’ll be with A24 and is titled The Land of Nod), it’s a good moment to revisit his 2023 ultra low-budget debut, which may have polarized audiences (some were freaked out, others fell asleep), but absolutely signaled the arrival of an intriguing new creator. The author of Let the Right One In provides the source material for this somber zombie movie, which is set in Norway and follows different people whose grief over losing a loved one becomes complicated when, well, the dead start waking up. With Smile 2 currently raking it in at the box office, will Smile 3 be far behind? Parker Finn’s 2022 original kicks off a series that could perhaps go on forever, spreading grinning ghouls across movie theaters and viral social media posts until the end of time. In this new-to-Hulu 2024 release set in oppressively dusty 1930s Oklahoma, Sarah Paulson plays an emotionally fragile mother who starts to believe a drifter (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) may actually be a malevolent supernatural entity—in a film that convincingly walks the line between “is it real?” and “wait… is she losing her mind?” Want more io9 news?

            "content": "Air travel can be a nerve-wracking experience for passengers with severe nut allergies. But as new research suggests, the actual risk of airborne exposure during a flight may not be as bad as people think. A widely speculated fear about flying may not have much scientific backing to it. In a new review of the evidence, researchers have concluded that nut allergens can’t spread easily, if at all, through an airplane’s ventilation system. While allergic passengers can still mitigate the risk of contamination by wiping down surfaces where nutty foods could touch, other policies such as total “nut bans” during flights are unlikely to be useful and could even be counter-productive, the researchers say. The worry that traces of peanuts and tree nuts—both common sources of food allergy—can go airborne while flying and cause someone to have a life-threatening allergic attack in a confined space is certainly common. As recently as this May, there have been reports of people claiming to have experienced severe anaphylaxis from simply being near the serving of nuts on a flight, and there is an ongoing Change.org petition to institute an industry-wide ban on nuts during flying. Some airlines, upon request, will now refrain from serving peanut and peanut products during a flight; others have gone as far as to ban their sale entirely. But the researchers behind this new research, published Wednesday in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood, argue that this worry is substantially overblown. The authors of the paper, Paul Turner and Nigel Dowdall, are specialists in allergy and aviation medicine, respectively. To make their case, they cite dozens of studies, including an earlier review commissioned and released by the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority last year that was authored by Turner. For one, the reported incidence of any food allergies while flying appears to be significantly lower (anywhere from 10 to 100 times lower) than on the ground, though the researchers note this lowered risk could be influenced by people’s heightened level of caution before boarding planes. That said, studies have found that peanuts simply don’t aerosolize well (i.e., when particles become airborne), even when being deshelled and broken open. At worst, deshelling seems to kick up very low levels of peanut dust into the air, but only at a close range and for a brief time. Other studies have had allergic people inhale or stay close to peanuts and peanut products, like peanut butter, in conditions mimicking an airplane cabin. These studies found that such exposures typically cause no symptoms in most people, and only mild, fleeting symptoms in a few. The other major stumbling block is the anatomy of a plane’s ventilation system itself, which is designed to circulate air across the aircraft, not along a cabin, further mitigating the risk of spreading any airborne dangers, whether they be germs or hypothetical nut dust. Passengers aboard a plane also breathe in a mix of recirculated but filtered air and air from the outside of the plane. As a result, and as noted in the new paper, the air in a cabin is typically replaced completely every three minutes, which is even better than the exchange rate seen in hospitals (about 10 minutes). All in all, the evidence points to little potential harm from airborne nuts, the researchers say. “Research studies (including aircraft simulations) show no evidence to support airborne transmission of nut allergens as a likely phenomenon,” they wrote. “Announcements requesting ‘nut bans’ are not therefore supported, and may install a false sense of security.” The pair’s findings are in line with other expert advice. In its most recently reviewed statement on the topic (February 2020), the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology states that “there is no evidence to support peanut vapor as a cause of reactions or that peanut dust itself circulates and causes reactions.” That’s not to say peanuts or other allergic foods can’t be a danger on flights. The researchers note that food proteins tend to be “sticky,” meaning the potential threat from allergic foods comes from lingering on surfaces that other foods or people’s hands might touch. And since airlines, especially budget ones, tend only to minimally clean their cabins between flights, allergy-prone passengers could benefit from being proactive with their own wet wipes, the researchers say. “In addition to dietary avoidance of trigger allergens, cleaning the seat area (including the tray table and the seat-back entertainment system) is likely to be the most effective measure food-allergic passengers can take to mitigate against the risk of unintended allergic reactions,” they wrote. Airlines can help allergic passengers out with this measure by allowing them to pre-board first and clean their area, though this is already a commonly provided practice. The researchers further recommend that people who are at risk of severe allergy carry at least two adrenaline autoinjector devices (Epi-pens are the popular brand name version) at all times, including while flying. And airlines should also have clear policies related to managing food allergies that are easily accessible through their websites or on request, which can then help reassure passengers. \nairplanesfood allergiesPeanutstree nuts  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          This applies to laptops, chargers, e-cigarettes, or anything with a rechargeable battery inside.\n         \n          If you're not subscribed to the streamer, the festive  Peanuts  classic will be available to all on AppleTV+ for two days in December.\n         \n          You'll have to get your annual dose of Charlie Brown's football and Snoopy's feasts this weekend if you're not an Apple TV+ subscriber.\n         \n          It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown  helped popularize the idea of Halloween specials, and it still holds up 57 years later.\n         \n          Starting today, you can add more of the SuperSize figures to your toy collection.\n         \n          Part of Apple TV+'s festive array of  Peanuts -centric programming,  For Auld Lang Syne  premieres on December 10.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "When toiling for months at a time in frozen Antarctica, there’s not a lot of opportunity for personal style—a big reason why the hat worn by helicopter pilot MacReady (Kurt Russell) in John Carpenter‘s 1982 sci-fi horror classic The Thing is so memorable. It instantly signals the character’s offbeat personality, and hints that maybe a guy unafraid to wear such giant, floppy headgear will also prove formidable while fighting, say, an alien that unexpectedly emerges from the ice. MacReady’s hat is the showpiece item in Propstore’s latest sale of entertainment memorabilia. But if you’re a horror fan with a lot of extra cash lying around, there are several more items to tempt your wallet. (Here’s where to go to register and bid.) Here are the 10 we’d most like to own—or at least admire from a distance. The starting bid on this bad boy is £20,000 (around $26,000); the Propstore catalogue says it “originated from a credited crew member to whom it was gifted by Russell following production.” It comes with “both brown leather and yellow and grey woven cord hat bands, a brown leather sweatband with a size tag reading “7 1/8,” and a brown leather chin strap.” It has some wear, but that’s to be expected: it survived a fierce alien brawl over 40 years ago! Ok, these are technically from different films: the hat is from 2003’s Freddy vs. Jason, and the sweater is from 1994’s Wes Craven’s New Nightmare. But both were worn by Robert Englund as one of horror’s most notorious villains. The items are being sold separately, so to complete the outfit you’ll need an estimated £10,000 to £20,000 ($13,000 to $26,000) for the hat—as well as that amount for the sweater, which is estimated to go for the same price. “You’ve got red on you!” Unfortunately, Shaun’s Foree Electric name tag is missing here, but you could whip up your own recreation to go with this screen-matched treasure from the Simon Pegg character’s wardrobe. The estimated price is £6,000-£12,000 ($7,800-$15,600), which means you might not have enough left over to buy a bouquet of flowers for your mom (which you then decide to give to your girlfriend instead… without swapping the card first, of course). Christopher Lee wore this distinctive checked jacket with suede elbow patches in several of his scenes in 1973 folk-horror classic The Wicker Man; including, according to Propstore, at the film’s fiery climax. As a bonus, “this garment was one of Lee’s favourite jackets. He wore it in several other films, including The Skull (1965), as well as for publicity photos and interviews from the 1960s until his death in 2015.” Few will ever be as dapper as Lee was, but for £10,000-£20,000 (estimated) you can give it a try. Of all the items in the auction, this is the one we’d be the most nervous to bring home—much less leave it sitting around for any random passer-by to fiddle with. Instantly recognizable to fans of Clive Barker’s 1987 film, this is the key if you want to invite a bunch of suffering-obsessed Cenobites into your dimension. So be careful! According to Propstore, this is prop was “one of eight crafted for use in Hellraiser; it’s “made of solid oak and has ornate brass-etched panels adhered to each side. A layer of varnish is applied all over to produce a slight shine. There are some signs of light scratching and the brass etchings have broken in some places.” All joking aside, this would be cool as hell to own—and is estimated to fetch £7,000-£14,000 ($9,100-$18,000). Infused with the dark magic of Stonehenge, and able to make the wearer’s head explode with creepy-crawlies when properly activated, this grinning jack o’ lantern is one of three designs proffered by Silver Shamrock Novelties in the cult-beloved 1982 threequel. It’s estimated to go for £3,000-£6,000 ($3,900-$9,600), which is a lot of tricks and treats. Sure, he has resting cute face here. But we all know the evil that lurks within! This prop was used in the 2017 seventh installment in the Child’s Play series, the last from original creator Don Mancini before Chucky took to the small screen for his TV show. While we wait for Chucky part eight (and maybe weave a few black magic spells to speed things along), you can get your mitts on this screen-matched Good Guy doll for an estimated £15,000-£30,000 ($19,500-$39,000). We all know a William Shatner mask, painted white, served as the expressionless visage of Michael Myers—first put to use when he set out on his Haddonfield murder spree in John Carpenter’s 1978 Halloween. But have you ever seen the mask pre-transformation? A 1975 Don Post Studios Captain Kirk mask would be a cool thing to own under any circumstance, but its association with Halloween makes it even more special. Propstore notes “Carpenter used a Captain Kirk mask for both Halloween and Halloween II, altering the design by painting it white, adding faux hair at the back of the scalp, and cutting out larger eye holes in the face …This specific mask was not used on the film and as such it maintains all of its Captain Kirk features, as it has not undergone the alteration process to become a Michael Myers mask.” It’s been foam-filled to make it easier to display, which unfortunately means you can’t actually try it on and spook your neighbors. The estimate for this rarity is £15,000-£30,000. You’ll need a groovy £8,000-£16,000 ($10,400-$21,000 estimated) to tame this full outfit and chainsaw rocked by Bruce Campbell in the first season of Ash’s small-screen adventures. The chainsaw, alas, is not functional; it’s “made of resin and metal pieces with a cotton twine pull cord and a moveable flipswitch on the outside.” It also has “a foam insert for where the chainsaw attached to Ash’s prosthesis.” Want more io9 news?

Here’s how it works.\n Imagine waking up on your 91st birthday to a friendly robot companion that brings your morning coffee and a nice warm robe to start the day in. After making you breakfast, it bids you good day and heads back into the closet for a quick charge-up.  In his weekly column, Android Central Senior Content Producer Nick Sutrich delves into all things VR, from new hardware to new games, upcoming technologies, and so much more. At around 11 a.m., you realize there's a new pain in your leg that you haven't experienced before, so you make a quick phone call to the doctor, and, in a minute, your robot companion emerges from the closet, entirely remote-controlled by your doctor. They can run scans, have a full conversation, and even perform exams, all without you having to leave your home and go through the irritating task of trying to find transportation across town. Later in the day, that same robot is driven by your 10-year-old grandson who just sat down with you at your dinner table. You have a very real, human conversation with them, despite living several states away, including videos of his latest whittling project and tales about what happened at school recently. Nothing replaces full face-to-face human interaction, but the ability for a fully remote-controlled robot that can be embodied by anyone with a VR headset like the Meta Quest 3 is a future I want to fully embrace. Tesla's \"We, Robot\" event this week helped me realize that this idea is something fully possible right now with the right technology and it, once again, proves to me that VR is the future of virtual human interaction.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk took the stage earlier this week at an event called \"We, Robot,\" unveiling new Tesla vehicles and giving a surprise look at the latest generation of Tesla Optimus robots. While Musk branded the robots as autonomous and hyped up the capabilities, it was found that they were partially remote-controlled by employees wearing VR headsets. As expected, many cried foul, but I look at this very differently. Instead of worrying about whether Tesla can actually launch autonomous robots by the end of 2025, I think the company needs to embrace its remote-controlled strategy fully. Optimus robots, remotely controlled by humans using advanced VR rigs, are the perfect way to deliver at-home care for the elderly, injured, disabled, folks with special needs, and more. While many science fiction universes have fully autonomous robots that perform these tasks, we're nowhere near this reality without significant safety issues. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Instead, certified trained individuals — along with people you permit — could feasibly help multiple people throughout every workday, providing meaningful human interaction when humans need it most. Here's a short clip of it in action: There is a person controlling it, like in the video below. What's most impressive is the fluid, natural movements. pic.twitter.com/PV5h9Pyi70October 11, 2024 Much like remote-controlled drones, robot operators would be able to see through the robot's \"eyes\" by wearing affordable VR headsets like the Meta Quest 3S. Moving the arms around could be done entirely with the motion controllers included, although I could imagine plenty of scenarios where more specialized controllers or gloves would make more sense. The current generation of robots utilizes a hybrid AI operation model, where operators move the robot around and the AI handles the actual task of making the legs and arms operate as we would expect a bipedal creature to move. Tesla also says that some tasks can be fully automated, and I imagine routines could even be programmed to make  Communication would be granted through a secure platform that includes multiple layers of security, including local authorization codes, phrases, or buttons that must be pressed to grant final access to the robot for the remote person. And, of course, there would need to be some sort of giant red \"off\" button or emergency override locally to ensure nothing bad happens. All of this is hypothetical, but it's built entirely on real-world solutions that exist today.  Mark Zuckerberg and plenty of other folks in the VR industry have told us that VR is about more than gaming for years. Some of the focus has been around a broader entertainment or next-generation social networking angle, but I think the most powerful form of virtual human interaction can be achieved through a mix of VR headsets, virtual worlds, and remote-controlled robots for real-world interaction. And while this sounds like it could be too costly for most households to afford, Musk says he can deliver on the robot vision for around $20,000-$30,000 \"long term\". Given that long-term care or hospice can cost thousands of dollars every single month, the idea of getting a competent human-assisted robot in your home for the cost of a few months in one of these facilities starts to sound quite affordable. Aside from the sheer convenience of being able to \"summon\" healthcare workers and loved ones to your home at any given moment, remotely operated robots could be a huge boon for overburdened healthcare workers who normally might only have time for one or two remote patients per day.  Being able to claim a 4-hour shift and spend a solid hour with each patient by quickly porting between robots means workers would spend less time on exhausting commutes and more time caring for patients. As I've learned from my own remote-only job, it also means they can have more time at home and with their own loved ones instead of wasting it away on a highway or at an office. Tesla is currently hiring virtual reality teleoperation positions for Tesla Bots, and the description of the job sounds awfully similar to what I'm envisioning here. The biggest difference, of course, is that this particular job also includes designing the remote systems that'll make the robots work on a wider scale, but future positions will almost certainly just be for certified workers to safely operate the bots remotely. If the purpose of making household robots is to enhance the lives of the people who own them, I can't think of a better way than to have that robot be the remote embodiment of people you trust and love. The possibilities here are nearly endless and it could easily be extended to help all sorts of people with disabilities, special needs, or even just remote socializing during times of loneliness or crisis.   You can't remotely control robots (yet), but you can spend time with friends or family through powerful virtual worlds that make you feel like you're really there, all at a low price.

If dampening background noise is a big deal for you, these are worth serious consideration as the best in the business.  Bose launched the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds in September 2023 and they should be easy to find in retail or online. It's unlikely Bose will release a succeeding pair to these until more time has passed, so expect these to be the company's flagship earbuds for a while yet. They start out at $299, but look for the odd discount when it happens, rare as it may be. They're available in Black or White Smoke.  From a design standpoint, the previous QuietComfort Earbuds II clearly influence what this pair looks like. They won't be the smallest you'll find but improved comfort and stability mean they're not likely to fall out, either. I'm pleasantly surprised at how well they hold up while riding my bike, and Bose helps by finding the best fit for your ears when going through the test in the Bose Music app. A tighter seal is crucial to getting the best noise-cancelation and sound quality, so it may take a little trial and error to figure out what's best for you. Mind you, these have the same 9.3mm drivers as the QuietComfort Earbuds II, though in going through the app's hearing test, Bose's CustomTune software adjusts the sound and noise-canceling to work best with your ear canals. You don't have to go through the hearing test but you also can't opt out of CustomTune. It works either way doing its best to tune things, and another reason for that is to manage spatial audio, or Immersive Audio, as Bose calls it. Much of the rest of the internal components otherwise change from before.  Finally, Bose gives some attention to hi-res audio codecs, making the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds feel more like the premium buds they're supposed to be. They support Snapdragon Sound, which includes aptX Adaptive to play hi-res tracks from sources offering them. That, plus Bluetooth 5.3, enable lower-latency playback as well, making these easier to trust when watching a show or movie. AptX Adaptive isn't quite as good as aptX Lossless but you won't notice anyway unless you always prefer to listen to tunes at the highest bit rates. Despite that, I'll give Bose credit for a solid default sound signature. Fully expecting to have to go to the EQ in the Bose Music app and redo it all, I only made minor tweaks before I was satisfied. Not that Bose gives you too many options. A 3-band EQ isn't good enough for expensive earbuds, and the existing presets largely swing things toward bass or treble.  That said, if you're looking for bass, you'll find it here. There's enough of a rumble off the bat but cranking it up with Bass Boost in the EQ really turns it up. Truly, though, these earbuds are at their best when you level things, especially because the mids bring out more detail. I also like the spatial effect of Immersive Audio for live recordings. Listening to concert albums or even high-quality stuff from YouTube brings out the crowd noise and atmosphere.  Without a doubt, the signature feature is the ANC. The QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds cancel out noise with the kind of regularity and reliability few others can handle. Wearing them on multiple flights, commutes, and bike rides, I'm impressed at how well they dampen most noise in varying conditions. It's a mark of excellent noise-canceling earbuds that you don't have to raise the volume much at all to hear your content clearly. That was the case with these just about every time. Sure, the odd fire truck siren or construction site jackhammer seep in, but they never feel like they'll break through entirely. By muffling them to a large degree, I didn't have to adjust anything along the way. When I did want to hear my surroundings — a must while riding a bike in a big city — I could easily switch to Aware mode by holding down the left earbud. There's plenty of detailed clarity, which is great, except my one bone of contention is how the onboard mics filter in voices. I had to take off an earbud more than once to clarify something someone said. Maybe I'm losing my hearing but I haven't experienced that with a couple of other comparable earbuds or headphones, so there's room for improvement there.  Touch controls are sometimes hit or miss on earbuds. Not so much on these. They're responsive and accurate just about every time. Tap once to play/pause, twice to skip a track, and three times to repeat one. Swiping up or down controls volume, which the earbuds can sometimes mistake as pausing playback, but that's the only real issue you might encounter controlling the QC Ultra Earbuds. Tap-and-hold cycles between ANC and Aware, though you can choose a different option, like waking your voice assistant or switching between paired Bluetooth devices. Initially, Bose didn't give the QC Ultra Earbuds multipoint connectivity — the ability to stay connected to two devices simultaneously — but adding that feature in a subsequent firmware update covered a key omission. Bose didn't really boost battery life here, so you get the same 6-hour estimate (with ANC on) that the previous QC Earbuds II have. Since noise cancelation is so effective, you don't have to raise the volume as much, which actually does the most to preserve battery each time. The case gives you three extra charges. Just keep a USB-C cable handy when it's time to recharge the whole package because there's no wireless charging here.  You can pay an extra $49 to get a wireless charging cover and enable that feature but that feels cheap for earbuds of this caliber. Don't force people to make that choice when competitors already include it without the markup. I'm also surprised the QC Ultra Earbuds aren't better for phone calls. In spite of outstanding noise-cancelation and audio quality, call quality doesn't seem to match overall audio quality. People I spoke with weren't impressed, suggesting other earbuds I've tested made my voice sound clearer. That's regardless of whether it was a quiet room or a bustling street. To me, it kind of feels like an extension of the Aware mode's muddier performance with voices. IPX4 protection is also pretty barebones for earbuds, in my view, so I can't recommend these for regular workouts given what they cost. I was fine wearing them for bike rides and made sure to clean them afterward, especially since there's no dust resistance. Light runs or workouts should be fine — as well as a splash of rain — but I doubt these will last a regular, sweaty routine.  Bose and Sony have been jabbing each other back and forth for years over who has the best combination of comfort, sound quality, and noise-cancelation. No surprise you'll find them both at the top of the best wireless earbuds for Android. It's usually the last one of those features that really puts them so close together, which is why the Sony WF-1000XM5 are such a compelling alternative. It's a toss up on whether they block out more noise, but they're also a very different design and offer more personalized features than the QC Ultra Earbuds. While they may not match Bose or Sony for world-class noise-cancelation, the Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 earbuds are superb and offer some conveniences those others don't have. Phone calls sound great, and LE Audio means you can use the case as a way to bridge wireless audio from sources only offering a headphone jack (think of an airplane's entertainment system).  You should buy this if...  You shouldn't buy this if...  Wireless earbuds are so ubiquitous today that you can choose a pair that's really good at key features you want. For the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, they'd have to be the combination of ANC and sound quality. Especially the noise cancelation because that's where these shine brightest against all others. You won't be disappointed in how they drown out what's happening around you. They're a pricey proposition considering what's missing here, which is why you have to weigh what you want to prioritize most above everything else. There's room for improvement but there's no doubt Bose took a step forward with these buds.   Ultra quiet time The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds deliver world-class noise-cancelation and excellent sound quality in a comfortable design you can enjoy every day.

Here’s how it works.\n Meta has once again surpassed all expectations of what a standalone VR headset can be for just $299. The Meta Quest 3S is quite literally a Quest 3 with the Quest 2's lenses and display, better hand tracking and low light tracking, a new mixed reality button on the headset, and all the exclusive games the more expensive Quest 3 gets. Enthusiasts will want to spend the extra money to get the better display and lenses of the Quest 3, but everyone else will likely choose the Quest 3S because of the price, yet get very little trade-off in the process. Powerful new chipset Excellent mixed reality quality Next-gen controllers and hand tracking Thousands of games, including Quest 3 exclusives A history of excellent monthly updates from Meta Unbelievable price Older lenses produce a dull image compared to Quest 3 90-degree FoV can feel constricting compared to PSVR 2 or Quest 3 No 3.5mm audio jack Why you can trust Android Central \n\n\nOur expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. When the Meta Quest 3S was first leaked, the idea of having a $299 Quest 3 headset seemed preposterous. How in the world could Meta possibly deliver a headset that's $200 cheaper without sacrificing the Quest 3's power, color mixed reality vision, new controllers with advanced haptic feedback, and all the improvements to the Quest ecosystem that have happened over the next year? Somehow, they've done it. The Meta Quest 3S is a triumph in nearly every way, from its highly polished onboarding presentation to the excellent mixed reality content that's been developed over the past year. It feels like a palpable upgrade from the Quest 2 and even sports some design and UX improvements over the more expensive Quest 3. Obviously, there have to be some concessions to get to a $299 price point but there are surprisingly few. The biggest is the display stack, as it uses the same lenses and display from the Quest 2 but still features plenty of visual upgrades and tweaks. That includes a next-generation processor, improved rendering and processing, and much more. If you're looking for a next-gen VR headset upgrade from a Quest 2 at an affordable price, you've found it.  The Meta Quest 3S retails for $299 and includes 128GB of storage, while the Meta Quest 3S with 256GB of storage retails for $399. Both models come in a white colorway and come with a pair of Quest 3 touch controllers, a preinstalled cloth head strap, and a preinstalled cloth facial interface. Every Meta Quest 3S comes with a free copy of Batman Arkham Shadow and 3 months of the Meta Quest Plus subscription service until April 2025. Some Meta Quest 2 accessories work on a Quest 3S, so you can keep some of those around instead of having to buy new ones. Likewise, most of the best Quest 3 accessories work on a Quest 3S, with the exception of the facial interface, which has a new design.  Meta has learned a thing or two about headset comfort over the past few years, but that doesn't mean the Quest 3S is perfect. It's only a gram lighter than the Quest 3, which was a few grams heavier than the Quest 2. All of this, despite still shipping with a cloth strap that I find generally uncomfortable, although it's fine for short play sessions. The biggest problem with the cloth strap is that it rests on the top of my ears and irritates my skin rather quickly. Meta is using the same Y-shaped top strap design it launched with the Quest 3, which means it better allocates weight across the head but still doesn't work anywhere near as well as the BoboVR M3 Pro head strap does, for instance. Beyond that, though, the Quest 3S is just as comfortable as the Quest 3 out of the box and maybe even more so thanks to the new facial interface design. The new, more padded, and supple face pad that was preinstalled on the headset feels wonderful. Historically, I couldn't wait to swap out the facial interface with a third-party one, but I've been pleasantly surprised by how comfortable this one is. The headset is also 20mm slimmer than the Quest 2, so it has a weight distribution closer to your face. Quest 3 is an additional 10mm slimmer than Quest 3S. However there are still three main reasons to choose a good third-party facial interface replacement once reputable companies release them. First is hygiene. The cloth is nice and soft but also absorbs sweat. Grab a $12 pair of silicone covers for now, especially if you sweat a lot or share the headset with other people. The second reason to replace the stock facial interface is because of lens fog. I haven't had issues with it during the review period because it's been cool and dry here, but as soon as the humidity ramps up again in half a year I'll need something more breathable. For now, Meta makes an excellent breathable facial interface with semi-transparent sides. I used this one at the Quest 3S hands-on event and loved it. Third, if you use glasses, some third-party facial interfaces have built-in glasses spacing adjustments. The default Meta Quest 3 facial interface includes a way to adjust for glasses, but the one on the Quest 3S doesn't. You'll need to use the glasses spacer in the box to do this which doesn't offer as many spacing options as the Quest 3 method. That said, the new interface design makes it far easier to swap out the facial interface than any other Quest headset to date. This has been improved with every generation, so it's good to see it continue to happen. But even if you don't swap out any of these modular parts right away, I think short play sessions will be comfortable enough. Thankfully, all the best Meta Quest 3 accessories work on the Quest 3S, except for the replacement of the facial interface. You'll need one specifically made for the Quest 3S. Keep in mind that the Quest 3S does not have a 3.5mm audio jack, so if you want to use headphones instead of the excellent built-in speakers on the Quest 3S arms, I recommend picking up a pair of PrismXR Vega T1 earbuds. Regular Bluetooth earbuds or headphones won't work in VR because Bluetooth's latency is too high. This can actually make you feel sick because of an odd disconnect between what your brain hears and what it sees. In my testing, I've found that the Quest 3S has the best battery life of any modern Quest headset. On average, I got around two and a half hours of use from a single charge, with more power-hungry games like Batman Arkham Shadow bringing that down to around 2 hours. I'd say if you were planning to just use the Quest 3S with the default head strap and facial interface, this is more than enough time before any kind of fatigue sets in. Grabbing a new head strap with built-in battery like the BoboVR M3 Pro or Kiwi Design H4 will add several hours of battery life and significantly better comfort overall, making it a worthwhile $50 upgrade.  If you directly compare the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S, this section holds the only real differences you'll notice. The Meta Quest 3S uses the same display and Fresnel lenses as the Meta Quest 2, so if you've only ever used a Quest 1 or Quest 2, you probably won't be particularly disappointed in the Quest 3S's display or lenses. All in all, they're fine and suit a $299 headset rather well. As with all Fresnel lenses, there's a small \"sweet spot\" right in the middle of each lens where you'll get the clearest view. Anything outside of this circle gets blurrier the closer you look to the edges. The Meta Quest 3S uses the same lenses and display as the Quest 2, foregoing most next-generation upgrades from the more expensive Quest 3. The 90-degree FoV on the Quest 3S's lenses feels a bit constricting compared to the substantially wider 110-degree FoV of the Quest 3. This difference cannot be understated, and it all melds together to show just how superior the lenses on the Quest 3 are. The Meta Quest 3S's lenses also adjust the same way as the Quest 2, so if you're coming from a Quest 2 you'll know exactly what to do. The only difference is that there's no 1/2/3 preset number in the middle of the lenses that changes as you adjust the spacing. Meta says it cut this mechanism to keep the manufacturing cost of the headset as low as possible, allowing it to hit that $299 price point. That being said, if you have an interpupillary distance (IPD) over 72mm you're probably going to find the Meta Quest 3S uncomfortable. If you find yourself in this boat, a 3D printed IPD expander like this one will push the lenses out a bit and help. If you plan to work in VR or use it for a lot of text-based applications, it makes more sense to spend the extra money on a Quest 3. Like the lenses, the display on the Meta Quest 3S is the same as the one on the Quest 2. It gets plenty bright, but the contrast is fairly low, the colors are a bit on the dull side, and the resolution is noticeably lower than the Quest 3's panels. As far as clarity is concerned, I'd say the resolution difference between Quest 3 and Quest 3S is similar to playing games at 1440p vs 1080p. The Quest 3S isn't as sharp, and fine detail gets a bit lost, but it's not offensively lower resolution. If there's any one area where the resolution and lenses make a big difference, it's for folks who want to work in VR. If that's going to be a big part of your headset usage, stick with the Quest 3.  The Meta Quest 3S and Quest 3 use identical controllers. These new controllers ditch the LED ring and tighten up some ergonomics for a much smaller profile than the Quest 2's controllers. Tracking is still done with LEDs, though, which are situated around the controller face and handles. Tracking is enhanced through better camera positioning around the headset—particularly the lower side-mounted cameras, which can see better along the sides and below the headset than on the Quest 2—and Meta's Horizon OS, which fills in any visual tracking gaps with gyro sensor data from inside the controller and an AI algorithm that predicts hand position based on arm and shoulder movements. The Meta Quest 3S uses the same advanced controllers as the Quest 3 and are powered by a single AA battery. Each controller is powered by a single AA battery. Based on my extended usage of the Quest 3 over the past year, you'll only need to swap them out once every two months or so, depending on how often you play. I recommend picking up these cheap Amazon Basics rechargeable AA batteries for a few bucks so you can keep reusing them. Each controller has a battery door that can be swapped out for any number of excellent controller accessories, like these AMVR controller grips, which add grip and help balance the controllers better with a handy hand strap. Quest 3S also supports what's called Inside-Out Body Tracking, which only a handful of games currently support. However, developers may start to use it more now that another Quest headset supports the feature. With this, in-game character movements will feel more realistic as the headset can properly align the virtual character's torso, shoulders, and arms with your actual movements in real life. Meta Quest 3S has also been outfitted with two IR illuminators on the front, positioned on the outside of each triple camera array on the front. This is a new feature for any Quest headset and allows the Quest 3S to see completely in the dark, provided you're in a small enough room. I tested different rooms at night with the lights off, and while tracking didn't work at all in my living room, it worked perfectly in any bedroom I tried it in. Essentially, as long as the Quest 3S can see walls, it will be able to track spatial movement in the dark. Likewise, hand tracking is better than ever—particularly in low light—than with any Quest headset to date. While I found daytime tracking performance and accuracy to be essentially identical to the more expensive Quest 3, Quest 3S can also track hands in the dark. That should help significantly in some dimly lit rooms when playing hand-tracked games or during casual entertainment when you're just using your hands to navigate the UI.  While you'll notice the controller differences and slimmer profile of the headset when unboxing it, nothing prepares you for the color mixed reality vision until you've tried it. It's not as clear as an Apple Vision Pro or even the Meta Quest 3 because of the lenses, but it's beyond just a generational upgrade from the Quest 2. If anything, it's like going from a 1950s black-and-white TV to a color HDTV. The Meta Quest 3S uses the same 4MP dual front-facing cameras as the Quest 3 and tends to look even brighter thanks to the lenses. Yes, Fresnel lenses aren't as crisp as the pancake lenses on Quest 3, but they allow more light in from the display giving it a distinctly brighter look. Because the lenses aren't as sharp and the display's resolution is lower, it's a bit harder to read text on a phone while wearing the headset, but this isn't a common mixed reality use case, anyway. Instead, you'll marvel at how fun games like Starship Home are. Mixed reality games allow you to turn your living room into a spaceship, defend against hordes of zombies in Drop Dead: The Cabin, or play a D&D-like board game together with other headset-wearing friends on your dining room table. When you're not viewing an augmented version of your real room, you'll be diving dungeons deep in Dungeons of Eternity, fighting bad guys in Batman Arkham Shadow, or just socializing on a Friday evening in Gorilla Tag or Orion Drift. There are thousands of games on the Meta Quest platform, and that number is growing every single month thanks to a new, more open marketplace and more VR players than ever. Of course, we maintain a list of the best Meta Quest games to give you a good starting point, and there are plenty of great ones to look forward to, like Skydance's Behemoth, Alien Rogue Incursion, Metro Awakening, and many more. All in all, Quest 3 games look a lot better than Quest 2 games, especially when they're Quest 3 exclusive. The Meta Quest 3S doesn't include a depth sensor like the Quest 3 has, but that doesn't seem to affect its mixed reality performance in my testing. As you can see in the video above, the Quest 3S is a little slower at mapping than the Quest 3 but not inordinately so. It took the Quest 3S roughly nine seconds longer to map my living room, but some of that time was because I ran into an early bug where hand tracking in some UI elements felt laggy. Realistically, it probably only took the Quest 3S around seven seconds longer to do the actual mapping, which is impressive given that it just uses cameras to do the work.  Meta's Horizon OS has been notably upgraded in its mixed reality capabilities since the launch of the Quest 3 last year, including automatic room mapping and object identification that makes mixed reality effortless. Additionally, a new mixed reality button on the bottom of the Quest 3S makes it effortless to jump between virtual reality and mixed reality. It's a substantial upgrade from all prior Meta Quest headsets which required you to perform an awkward and extremely unreliable double-tap on the side of the headset.  Because the VR gaming industry is relatively small compared to traditional consoles, the Meta Quest 3S's closest competition is made up of Meta headsets. The Quest 3S replaces the Quest 2 as the new standard in affordable VR. Its processor is 100% more powerful than the Quest 2, enabling it to play far richer and more detailed games and render impressive color mixed reality in your room. It's an easy recommendation to upgrade from a Quest 2 because of the price, but the full next-generation upgrade can be found in the Meta Quest 3. Compared to the Quest 3S, the Meta Quest 3 sports next-generation lenses with a 20-degree wider field of view (FoV), significantly enhanced clarity, a higher resolution display, and better contrast and colors than the Quest 3S. Surprisingly, Quest 3 doesn't include IR illuminators, so it can't play in the dark like Quest 3S. If you're a PCVR-only player, it would also make more sense to get a Quest 3 because of the enhanced clarity brought about by the lenses and display. Otherwise, if you prefer a headset with an OLED display or a much smaller headset, Bigscreen Beyond is your best bet.  You should buy if... You shouldn't buy if... The Meta Quest 3S is a triumph in every regard. It's an unbelievable bargain at $299, yet it still exhibits the best mixed reality and virtual reality gaming available today. The only real compromises are the lenses and display, which are worse than the Quest 3 but not detrimentally so. If I had to compare the experience to more traditional gaming specs, I'd say it's similar to the difference between a 1080p and 4K setup. Otherwise, the Meta Quest 3S is everything you need in a VR and mixed-reality headset today. It not only offers the highest-quality standalone VR games available—including the incredible free pack-in Batman Arkham Shadow—but it also connects to any PC and can play PCVR games completely wirelessly. It's a win-win-win for anyone looking to get into VR or upgrade from an older headset. There are certainly reasons to choose a Quest 3 over a Quest 3S, but for most people, the price point and overall value of the Quest 3S make it a must-buy console this Holiday season.   Get next-generation virtual reality and mixed reality games and apps with the Meta Quest 3S, a surprisingly affordable headset with capabilities beyond your imagination.

            "content": "\n    Preorders are live for this $250 N64 reimagining. It's expected to ship in the first quarter of 2025.\n   Analogue 3D in white The Analogue 3D, an upcoming game console that can play Nintendo 64 cartridges at 4K, is set to release in the first quarter of 2025 for $250, Analogue said in a press release last Wednesday. Preorders are live.  The Analogue 3D, like the well-reviewed Analogue Pocket handheld, uses a field-programmable gate array, or FPGA, chip that can emulate hardware down to the transistor level. So, unlike software emulation, Analogue's approach achieves 100% game compatibility.  Given that modern hardware is significantly more powerful than what Nintendo was able to churn out in 1996, the Analogue 3D can run games at a 4K resolution, which is 10 times the resolution of most of the N64 catalogue. The Analogue 3D supports Bluetooth LE, Wi-Fi and has four controller ports for multiplayer fun. It's also compatible with modern controllers, like the 8BitDo 64 controller. Analogue says that because of the way the N64 rendered graphics, many games from that era tend to look best on an old-school CRT television. This is because CRTs had an analogue signal output and created an image using scanlines instead of fixed pixel grids. Because images were rendered on a CRT line-by-line, it smoothed out pixels, creating a softer look to the square pixels output by an N64. Since modern displays can show every pixel with greater sharpness and clarity, old-school systems that run at lower resolutions tend to look blocky as a result.  To remedy this, Analogue is essentially creating filters that mimic that original CRT look. Analogue says the \"Original Display Modes are meticulously reproduced\" and \"virtually indistinguishable recreations of CRT displays to capture the warmth, depth and texture in every frame\" while also emulating the \"soft glow of phosphor.\"  Analogue 3D surrounded by various controllers. Analogue is an American gaming hardware company that specializes in bringing retro consoles into the modern age. It began to gain wide recognition with the release of the Analogue NT, a system designed to play Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Famicon cartridges on a modern HD television through HDMI. It was 2021's $220 Analogue Pocket, however, that gave the company mainstream appeal.  The Pocket is a gaming handheld that can play Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Sega Game Gear, Atari Lynx, TurboGrafx-16, Neo Geo Pocket and Pocket Color cartridges on a modern LCD display at a sharp 1,600x1,440-pixel resolution. Like a Nintendo Switch, there's also a docking station that could output those games onto a television via HDMI. The Analogue Pocket consistently sells out and its limited edition colorways can sometimes end up on eBay for wildly inflated prices. Some fans online have criticized the company for its strategy of doing limited edition drops as a way to gain repeat purchases.  The Analogue 3D is the only third-party N64 console on the market that works with actual game cartridges. Analogue says that creating the 3D was particularly challenging because of how N64 games were developed at the time. The company says that 100% compatibility hasn't ever been achieved on any sort of emulation until now. Even rereleases of N64 games on the Switch by Nintendo itself ran into graphical bugs and other issues.  While the Nintendo 64 did include a controller packed in with the box, the Analogue 3D won't. Fans will either need to grab their original N64 controllers from the basement or buy the 8BitDo 64, available for $40. "

            "content": "\n    I've tested nearly every smart speaker and smart display from Amazon and Google in my home, and they are similar, yet vastly different.\n   Smart speakers and displays have a lot of useful features that can add convenience and fun to your home. The rise of smart speakers nearly 10 years ago ushered in a new era of smart homes, making a personal digital assistant accessible to the average person. But the connections to different device brands, utility features and entertainment options make the smart speakers and displays stand out. With Google and Amazon leading the charge in this space, it can be tough to tell which is right for you. Each company offers a competent voice-activated assistant capable of handling questions, timers, reminders, playing music, controlling smart home devices and more. But there are key differences between the two platforms that are important to consider before settling on one. Using your smart display to ask Google Assistant to play videos from YouTube is great when working in the kitchen. The Amazon Echo Show 10 and Google Nest Hub Max smart displays are both great entertainment machines with good audio and large screens you can use to watch TV shows and movies. But what you watch and the way you watch it are quite different. While you can ask Alexa or Google Assistant to play a video on Netflix, the rest of the video streaming services don’t match up the same. The big win for Google here is direct access to YouTube. The massive user-driven service has billions of hours of every subject on Earth and isn't available on Amazon Echo Products. Technically, you can access YouTube on your Echo Show, but it requires a browser and isn’t a great experience. Chromecast is built into Google's smart displays, expanding the video platforms you can use. Google's Chromecast is another win in the video content category, as it's built into all of its smart speakers and displays. This lets you easily send Chromecast-compatible content on your phone directly to your Google Nest device. Amazon doesn't have proper access to YouTube, but it does have direct access to Prime Video, which Google doesn't.  The Echo Show 8's new 13-megapixel camera will pan and zoom on a squirmy subject to keep them front and center.  Hands-free calling can help when your hands are full or you’re in the middle of a task. It's even more convenient when you can make phone calls using your Google Assistant-powered smart speakers and displays, like real phone calls. Amazon Echo devices allow you to call other Echo speakers, but Google’s smart speaker allows you to call any of your contacts so long as they're in the US or Canada. If you’re using Google Fi or Google Voice, your calls will go through as if you were calling from your phone. These types of calls work on all Google Assistant speakers, like the Nest Mini, but if you have a Nest Hub Max with a camera, you can also make video calls. Depending on your preferences, Google Assistant enlists Duo or Zoom will handle these calls. A dedicated lights tab shows you the current status of all the smart lights in your home. Many people intend to use a smart speaker with their smart home. While Google Assistant speakers and Amazon Echo speakers can both connect to and control a slew of devices and brands, Amazon works with more. According to a report from Statista, as of July 2020, Alexa is compatible with over 100,000 devices, compared to Google’s current estimate of 50,000.  The more devices you can connect to your Echo, the easier it is to build the smart home you want without facing compatibility issues.  Some smart home devices will work best with Google Nest and others with Amazon Echo. You’ll have more options with Amazon devices. Knowing which devices you want in your smart home is important because even compatible devices work better on some platforms than others. You’ll have a better experience using Ring devices with Amazon over Google, for example, but the opposite is true for Nest devices. Amazon Echo devices are available in many styles, but they can all be great home assistants. Aside from the products your Echo speaker can connect with, the speakers themselves have sensors and functionality that Google Nest speakers don’t. For example, the Echo Dot has a built-in temperature sensor that can tell you how warm or cool it is in the room and be used to trigger automations, making it a better companion to smart thermostats, heaters and fans. The Echo Dot, along with other Echo speakers, can connect with Eero routers, some of the best mesh Wi-Fi routers you can buy, to act as Wi-Fi network extenders, strengthening the signal throughout the home. Amazon Echo devices offer a distinct advantage with voice-activated shopping capabilities. You can buy items directly from Amazon using an Echo speaker, receive updates on order statuses and manage subscriptions. While you can search for Amazon products using Google, you won’t be able to buy anything or be notified of purchases from the online retail juggernaut if you use one of its Nest speakers. This feature is handy for Amazon power shoppers. In addition to shopping and buying on Amazon through your Echo, your smart speaker can also notify you when your order has shipped, been sent out for delivery, or delivered. These features may not be used daily, but asking Alexa to reorder batteries is so nice. Don’t worry, you can still stop your kids from running up a bill with Amazon shopping. In terms of music services, people on Amazon have seamless access to Amazon Prime Music and other streaming services that Google Nest doesn't offer. This gives you more options for music streaming and a broader range of listening experiences if you have an Echo. But YouTube Music is available on Google Nest, which Amazon Echo fans will miss out on. The Nest Audio comes in five colors. While design preferences are subjective, Google has long emphasized aesthetics in its products for our homes. Amazon has improved in this area since the third-gen Echo, but I still give Google the edge.  The Nest Hub Max is the most bland, with only two color choices: chalk and charcoal. But considering all you really see is the screen, the fabric-covered back isn’t a major factor. The second-gen Nest Hub gets two additional colors -- mist and sand.  The two speakers, Nest Mini (second gen) and Nest Audio are entirely covered in fabric. Their organic shapes and muted color palette mean these smart speakers blend well into nearly any home decor. The Nest Audio comes in five colors: chalk, charcoal, sage, sand and sky. For the second-gen Nest Mini, we have chalk, charcoal, coral and sky. There are so many smart speakers and displays from Amazon and Google that it can be overwhelming to compare them. I've put together a chart that allows you to see all the current models of smart speakers and displays from both brands to help you see what you get with each model.  The Amazon Echo and Google Nest platforms both have distinct advantages. So long as you know what’s important to you when you weigh up the differences, whichever you choose will be great.   Google Nest is ideal for people who want the most access to the most video content, robust communication features and better aesthetics. On the other hand, Amazon Echo excels in shopping functionality, music services and smart home compatibility. Remember to consider your needs and the needs of your home, and you’ll be just fine."

            "content": "\n    With Betty Boop visuals and vintage audio, Mouse: P.I. for Hire mashes up classic cartoon style with intense shooter gunplay.\n   Last week, the Xbox Partner Showcase revealed a new trailer for a game that's lit up players' imagination thanks to its subversive take on a classic cartoon. Mouse: P.I. for Hire, the upcoming first-person shooter due in 2025 from Polish studio Fumi Games, looks like Steamboat Willie had been handed a few guns to cut loose and make Walt Disney roll over in his grave.  But when I caught up with the developers in Cologne, Germany, at Gamescom back in August, they told me they didn't set out to be iconoclasts mocking Mickey Mouse. Instead, they're avid fans of the Betty Boop era of classic cartoons. Though this early period of cartoons has a cozy patina of silliness, the content was frequently violent and morbid, making for a fun juxtaposition that fits shooters. Fumi Games started as an animation studio, its lead producer Maciej Krzemień told me, and its artists explored many art styles over the years. The one they settled on for the game that would eventually become Mouse: P.I. for Hire -- the so-called \"rubber hose\" style embodied by Fleischer Studios cartoons of the 1930s and 40s -- wasn't even popular in Europe at the time. It caught on way later, in the 1980s and 90s, Krzemień said. And it remains appealing. Rubber hose, named for the loopiness of characters' body parts and movements, was the first big American animation style in cartoons, embodied in characters like Betty Boop and Popeye. \"I think the rubber hose style is universal enough that everyone can find some sense of joy in watching those cartoons and recreating them,\" Krzemień said.  Fumi Games' developers wanted to make a shooter with a cartoon look, and it was Fumi Games' art director who was such a fan of the rubber hose animation style. He discovered a piece of fan art for the game BioShock, created by Liz is the Biz and posted on Tumblr and was inspired to create his own vision of a rubber hose shooter. He posted the result to X, formerly known as Twitter, back in 2022. That took off, and the team had to scramble to capitalize, Fumi Games CEO and game director Mateusz Michalak recalled. \"Back then, we didn't have even a Steam Page,\" Michalak said, adding that he quickly made one over the weekend after the screenshot went viral.   While chatting at Gamescom, the developers demonstrated how far the game had come since that early prototype. Despite retaining its fun, cartoony look, the game's gunplay looks tightly designed with new abilities for traversal. One example includes a grappling hook ability that uses the player character's tail, which fleshes out the game's \"metroidvania\" exploration elements.  Fumi Games' developers recalled an online comment on earlier footage calling Mouse: P.I. for Hire \"if Cuphead and Doom had a baby.\" Appropriately, the studio brought on developers of the recent Doom (2016) and Doom Eternal first-person shooters to consult for the game.  The game's noir-esque story has been fleshed out, too. Players slip on the white gloves of Jack Pepper, a World War I veteran turned private eye who runs and guns his way through the grimy streets of Mouseburg. True, there's a stylistic resemblance to Disney's black-and-white Steamboat Willie. But Mouse: P.I. for Hire leans into other rubber hose hallmarks like smiling flowers and an amusing smiling bullet icon in the ammo counter. Jack Pepper and the other rodents you encounter have a pronounced snout that looks more like Rat Fink than Mickey Mouse's progenitor.  It's the animations that sell Mouse's fantasy. While the pistol, shotgun, tommy gun and lewis machine gun are deadly accurate with their precise gunplay, they bounce around with cartoonish vigor. The reload animations look delightfully loose, highlighting the game's enjoyable contrast between cartoon silliness and lethal shooter gameplay.   \"Our animations are created from the ground up using very old-school techniques,\" said Michalak. But the developers noted how challenging it can be to hand-animate elements so consequential to gameplay as how the guns work. The team might have to speed up or slow down reload speeds or fire rates, for example, to properly balance a gun. It's difficult to cut a feature if it's already animated, so the team has to be careful about what makes it that far, and what they can salvage from cut materials. Once finished, the animations are all put together in the graphics program Blender and then implemented in Unity, the popular engine used in Mouse: P.I. for Hire and many other games. To situate the game's sound in its 1930s noir period, Fumi Games took two different approaches. Not only did the studio have a \"big band\" jazz orchestra compose and record new tracks specifically for the project, but it also licensed music from the 1930s to ground players in the sound of that decade. At a fan's request, the studio implemented another neat trick to evoke the period -- crackling audio. This effect  can be toggled on and off from the settings menu to simulate the experience of listening to aging wax cylinders or vinyl recordings. Cartoons and violent video games aren't too far from each other, Krzemień noted, since old cartoons can feature dark and mature themes. It's not difficult to find an old \"rubber hose\" cartoon that features death, poisoning, alcoholism and worse. Sometimes they're intended as moralistic fables, but they're often just for thrills. Heck, one of the most famous Fleischer cartoons sees Betty Boop going to Hell.  But Krzemień sees cartoons as being much more than just an entertainment medium. As Mouse: P.I. for Hire proves, he views them as being a source of inspiration, too.  \"I believe [cartoons are] a great Bible for people that they can use and create something new,\"  Krzemień said."

We also have some information on what we saw from streaming services last year to better help you decide which deals you may want to jump on now and others you may want to hold out for. Keep checking back, as we're continuously searching for new offers and will be continuously updating this page as new deals drop.   Hulu Plus Live TV's base package includes more than 95 live TV channels, unlimited DVR and access to the ad-supported Disney Bundle. That means you can stream content from Disney Plus, ESPN Plus and Hulu on-demand. Its price recently increased to $83 a month, but this early Black Friday deal knocks the price down to $60 per month for three months. Sign up before Nov. 19 at 3 p.m. ET to catch live NFL games, news broadcasts and more.  Live TV streaming service Fubo offers three main packages, with a base plan that provides more than 200 channels. Sports fans can find a variety of RSNs to watch games from their favorite teams, and the service includes cloud DVR.  Right now, you can sign up to get $20 off your first month on these subscriptions: Pro, Elite with Sports Plus or Deluxe. Fubo's Spanish-language Latino plan has also been discounted from $33 a month to $20 for the first month. Fans of boxing can scoop up unmatched access to boxing content for a lot less right now. The streaming platform is slashing prices by 50% on subscriptions, which drops the monthly price down to $15 per month (with a minimum three-month subscription) or the annual plan down to $10 per month for 12 months.  Cord-cutters who have been holding out on YouTube TV's NFL Sunday Ticket can score the add-on for $209. This offering grants access to the remaining Sunday games if you have the YouTube base plan, and you have the option to pay in installments. Bundling with the base plan will save you even more, as the YouTube TV price of $73 is slashed to just $50. However, if you cancel YouTube TV you will lose access to NFL Sunday ticket. And if you're only looking for the NFL Sunday ticket, there's also a deal to get it for just $264.  These deals are available now through Nov. 18. It's worth noting that we did see a further price cut last Black Friday, but there's no guarantee that we will this year and you'll miss out on games between now and then, so those are things to consider before you sign up. MagellanTV has a huge collection featuring more than 3,000 curated documentaries ready for your next movie marathon. While an annual subscription usually costs $60, you can grab a 2-year subscription for $60 right now, essentially you netting you a 50% discount or offering a whopping 3-year subscription for just $72, which means you'll be essentially paying just $24 per year. Streaming services as exclusive membership bonuses: Other streaming deals happening now: Additionally, some streaming services offer special discounts for students, which you can check out here.  Keep checking back, as we'll be updating this page with Black Friday streaming service deals for 2024 as we get closer to the main event.  Read more: Best Early Black Friday TV Deals: Don't Miss These Discounts on LG, Sony, Hisense and More Generally, yes. Many streaming services offer really great Black Friday deals. For example, top streamers like Hulu and Peacock have offered great rates during Black Friday sales. In fact, last year Hulu offered a year of service for just $1 per month. However, the caveat is that some Black Friday deals are exclusive to new subscribers, while others may only last for a few months, rather than the entire year. If you know you want to sign up for a streaming service soon, it may be best to skip free trial offers and instead sign up as a new subscriber closer to Black Friday.   That's hard to say, as it depends on your preferences. However, it's worth noting that Netflix has not participated in Black Friday price cuts previously, while we've seen deals from Peacock, Disney, Hulu, Starz, Fubo and more, so there should be plenty of offerings to help you get access to new content at a great price.  "

            "content": "\n    From faster app switching and web browsing to improved selfies, next year's Android phones have a lot to gain from the Snapdragon Elite chip.\n   Chief among Qualcomm's newest chips is the Snapdragon 8 Elite, which will bring more AI features and faster speeds to next year's top-tier Android phones. The chip was announced at the Snapdragon Summit 2024 alongside Qualcomm's other new products. Apart from AI, some of the best things it can do are far more humble than artificial intelligence: It'll fix several pain points and make using phones less irritating. Though most of the stage time at Snapdragon Summit was dedicated to big-picture advancements — there was much forecasting of how people will use smartphones differently with what are being called \"AI agents\" — the more mundane improvements will start affecting people's phone use the moment folks buy an Android phone that's packing the new Snapdragon 8 Elite.  This smattering of quality-of-life features covers a grab bag of topics, but three rise to the top: improving web browsing, extending wireless audio from Bluetooth to Wi-Fi, and using generative AI to apply an artificial light source in your selfies.  We're in our first year of generative AI on smartphones, and despite being inundated with promises of how much it'll change our mobile life, the most we've gotten is a handful of cool tricks on phones like those in the Samsung Galaxy S24 series and the Google Pixel 9 family. Apple Intelligence, the flagship feature in the iPhone 16 series, hasn't launched yet, a month after the phones came out — a few Apple Intelligence features are slated to drop next week. So it's refreshing to see new features in the Snapdragon 8 Elite that'll make the way we currently use phones a bit easier. This demo of the AI lighting feature shows how it could improve selfies. The coolest annoyance-killing improvement is a camera feature powered by generative AI. Instead of removing elements a la Google Pixel's Magic Eraser, this one adds light where it's needed most: on your face.  The feature, meant for selfies, acts like a directional, soft light source that can illuminate parts of your face darkened by shadow. Once you turn it on, you can tap and hold to move the light around, choosing the angle that most flatters you and fits your surroundings. And if you're in a creative mood, you can dial the intensity up or down, or even shift the color of the artificial light along the RGB spectrum. I got to play with the feature in a demo, and it felt delightfully fun and helpful. I imagine it would be most useful for balancing out brightly backlit situations, like when you're standing in front of a sunset or sitting inside with an outdoor vista behind you. Though I tried this feature on a reference device, I'm excited by the potential to fix faulty photos and make up for cameras that can't yet handle light and darkness.  In a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment during the Snapdragon Summit keynote presentation, Qualcomm presenters noted that the Snapdragon 8 Elite made web browsing faster. While that's exactly what it sounds like — web pages load faster — it's also true that a lot of phone operations rely on connecting to the web. Currently, many smartphone apps load web browsing information in the background while you navigate their interface.  \"Browsing doesn't just mean opening up a browser and getting particular information,\" Manju Varma, director of product management focused on CPU technology at Qualcomm, told me at the summit. \"The applications will use data for researching, getting sports and entertainment news, shopping — all this entails what we call browsing.\" The micro architecture in the new Oryon central processing unit, coming in Qualcomm's mobile chips for the first time with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, enables this speed boost. As a result, cache capacity is increased and memory hierarchy optimized for real-world uses like browsing data on apps. Switching between apps faster is another benefit from the browsing data speed boost. A demo shows improved browsing speeds enabled by Qualcomm's Snapdragon Elite 8 chip (the higher score on the right means better performance). At the summit, Qualcomm set up demo rooms for attendees to test these new features for themselves. One station showed a simple test for faster browsing that had two phones running Browser Bench's online Speedometer 3.0 test, which has machines run through browsing tasks. The Snapdragon 8 Elite reference device (not a commercially available phone) scored 33.7, while the device running last year's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 scored 16.1. For the sake of comparison, an iPhone 16 Pro scored 29.6, and my own iPhone 15 Pro Max scored 29.7. (The numbers are just a comparative metric and don't represent any specific rate of browser processing, but higher numbers mean better performance.) This improved browsing speed will, yes, even enhance forthcoming generative AI tasks as well as gaming, said Karl Whealton, Qualcomm's senior director of product management focusing on CPU and neural processing unit. \"CPU is in everything,\" Whealton said. \"Every single thing runs CPU. Some things run it a little bit; some things run it a lot. But everything you do is going to be improved.\" Last year's Snapdragon Summit was also dominated by generative AI, as the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 was the first to get the new technology. One feature that chip didn't get but that was also introduced a year ago, XPAN, will debut on the Snapdragon 8 Elite — and it should make dropped audio over Bluetooth less common. Your phone can drop its connection to your Bluetooth speaker if the two gadgets get too far away from each other or the signal hits interference. The XPAN feature, which hands off Bluetooth to Wi-Fi, could help solve that issue. Put simply, XPAN lets audio transition from Bluetooth to Wi-Fi. This should allow you to roam far away from the source of your music or podcasts and still hear them, so long as your headphones or speaker are on the same Wi-Fi network as the phone or computer they're connected to. During this year's summit, one demo featured XPAN in action. In front of me was a wireless speaker that was blasting music — a pop tune heard over the din of the demo room — streamed from a phone over a hundred feet away. To illustrate, the demo had a camera pointed at the phone, which was at the other end of the building.  This demo showed one scenario, and I'd be interested to see how XPAN handles other hurdles that normally hinder a Bluetooth signal, like solid walls and increased distance. But if it works, that's one less annoyance you'll have to deal with as your local Wi-Fi network serves as a backup to ensure your music and podcasts don't drop out. This could be a godsend for people in homes and workplaces riddled with building materials that are unfriendly to Bluetooth signals. Each of these three features has the potential to make phones easier to use. Probably the most common complaint every smartphone owner has is, Why doesn't this feature just work? But let's face it: A lot of stuff does. It's the growing complexity of smartphones and of our interconnected web of devices that make it harder for features to live up to expectations.  This applies to hardware and software. Connecting Bluetooth headphones and speakers used to be a challenge, but now we expect it to be quick and seamless. And it was a revelation to learn that apps could harness all of a phone's sensors, like the gyroscope and GPS. The new frontier is people's expectation that all their data can easily be shared between apps, whether that's health information, passwords or subscriptions.  So when companies come along and make it a bit easier for something to work in the background, or they add a camera feature that seems like a no-brainer in hindsight, that's of course a good thing: It takes a little bit of the friction out of living our lives through our pocket supercomputers. "

            "content": "\n    Here's what's coming with the new Apple lineup of a smaller Mac Mini, iMac in an array of colors and MacBook Pro in space black.\n   In a trendy corner of Los Angeles, I got to try the new Mac Mini, iMac and MacBook Pro machines Apple just announced, which are powered by the company's new M4 chips with Apple Intelligence AI.  These updated desktops and laptops offer a range of improvements, some of which are minimal, like the MacBook Pro's additional Thunderbolt port and the Mac Mini's smaller size. But the biggest advancement is the introduction of Apple-designed M4 chips in all models, which enable more AI features, capabilities and gaming performance. I saw some of these on display in Apple's Los Angeles showcase, including demos of audio creation, video editing and gaming -- and I came away impressed.  A few caveats: I wasn't able to run any sort of benchmark tests or try anything beyond what was available as part of Apple's demos. Please stay tuned for our full reviews coming soon, which will show exactly how Apple's lineup of M4 Mac Mini, iMac and MacBook Pro models stack up to their predecessors and the growing competition of Microsoft's AI-powered Copilot Plus PCs.  Despite the surprisingly simple list of colors -- Apple typically attaches some hyperbolic descriptor to its hue names -- the rainbow of M4 iMacs was too visually arresting to ignore. The M4 iMacs come in blue, purple, pink, orange, yellow, green and silver, all in subtle two-tone schemes. The back of the computer has the bolder version of the hue, while the metallic stand and front panel below the display are slightly more subdued versions of the same color.  This makes them more attractive than ever, and they're just as thin as last year's iMac M3 models. What's new are the Thunderbolt 4 ports (two on the cheaper configuration with two USB-C ports, or four on the pricier end), sharper 12-megapixel camera enabling Center Stage and the optional nano-texture display that cuts down on glare -- useful for office workers with lighting at unfortunate angles.  I saw the new Desk View feature of the camera, too, which captures video of what's on your actual desk beneath the iMac's display. While this felt gimmicky, it could conceivably be helpful for streamers working with their hands-on crafts or instructors writing math equations in longhand over Zoom, for instance.  An older Mac Mini (left) compared to the new M4-powered Mac Mini (right).  I'm a huge fan of small gadgets, so I found the new Mac Mini to be as visually delightful as it is powerful. Just like with clamshell foldable phones, additional thickness is a worthwhile tradeoff if it means reducing the device's overall footprint. Apple helpfully placed an older Mac Mini alongside the new one, and while the former is still impressively sized, the new Mini can be palmed in one hand. This is an M4-powered computer you could throw in a purse. A bottom view of an older Mac Mini on the left and a new 2024 Mac Mini on the right. Note the power button in the top-right corner of the updated version's all-black bottom. Yes, Apple has made another immediately infamous design choice in putting the power button on the bottom, but it's easier to tilt the new Mini up to turn it on (if people switch their computers off anymore). The USB-C ports on the front are a nice addition for accessories that don't need the 40-gigabits-per-second bandwidth of the three Thunderbolt 4 ports on the back. There's a 3.5mm headphone jack in the front along with an HDMI out and Ethernet port in the back -- all your basics covered.  A bottom view of the new Mac Mini 2024, showing the power button's placement. With the computer sitting on a desktop and the ports facing forward, the button is just under the left-rear   corner. One of the Mac Mini demos showed how it can run Logic audio editing software, within which the AI Music Maker can add AI-created music tracks to videos. These can be constructed piecemeal, adding layer by layer of drums, bass, keyboards and other musical elements -- each of which can be tweaked with broad controls -- no music theory knowledge necessary.  The Logic computer program running AI Music Maker. Drums are on the top in yellow, while guitar and keyboard are below but not selected. For instance, our demonstrator added a kick drum and hi-hat cymbals just by tapping a few icons to add complexity to the track (in this case, more frequent and varied drums between the major beats). Melodic instruments can go up and down octave scales, while piano keyboards can select one or both \"hands\" to add high, low or both ranges of chord scales to audio. All of this is created on the fly by AI and is usable royalty-free.  The MacBook Pro 2024 with M4 Max chip and 128GB of RAM playing the 2019 game Control. The new MacBook Pro models didn't add anything to the layout or design over last year's M3 models, though the lower-end M4 14-inch MacBook Pro now comes with three USB-C ports instead of two. In fact, all of this year's models feature three Thunderbolt 4 ports (upgrading to a M4 Pro or M4 Max offers Thunderbolt 5, which delivers up to 120Gbps of data transfer speeds). On a maximum-specced MacBook Pro 16-inch model with an M4 Max chip and 128GB of RAM, I saw a demonstrator ask Siri AI to perform a few tasks, including offering advice on how to combine PDFs. Through Apple's partnership with ChatGPT, I saw the AI chatbot answer a more complicated search query asking for things to do in Malibu. The system took a couple of seconds to respond on both occasions, which was about the same time it took the iMac a few tables away to perform the same task. The laptops could also turn photos into AI-generated cartoons, taking about the same elapsed time -- somewhat similar to the image generator feature showcased on Microsoft Copilot Plus PCs released earlier this year. The most impressive feat I saw the M4 chips perform was pushing pixels to play Remedy Entertainment's 2019 game Control. Apple chose a section of the third-person shooter set in dark, murky caves lit with bright flashes to show off the M4's ray-tracing capabilities. As I stomped through puddles of water to shoot enemies, I was able to see accurate reflections of my surroundings. Granted, this was running on a fully specced MacBook Pro with an M4 Max chip and 128GB of RAM, so I'm curious about how the more modest configurations would handle such a graphical workload.  Overall, the Los Angeles demo session was a brief and controlled yet tantalizing peek at Apple's new lineup of computers. Some will charm with their looks, others with their modest upgrades, but all promise the performance upgrades that enable AI capabilities. However, it's worth noting that we won't know how indispensable these tools will be until Apple Intelligence rolls out and software companies integrate the next-generation tech."

            "content": "\n    Samsung's book-shaped foldable stands out for its reliable app support and stunning display.\n   The crease on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is still visible The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is all about the screen. That may be obvious given that its tablet-size internal display is what sets it apart from a standard smartphone.  But phones -- especially foldable ones -- are built to do a lot of things, from snapping photos to playing music and streaming video. Revisiting the $1,900 Galaxy Z Fold 6 three months after it came out has only reinforced the idea that this is for someone who wants a phone that can make the most of having two screens in one. Samsung's prioritization of ensuring that software works across the main screen in any position is the Z Fold 6's biggest advantage over its competitor, the $1,799 Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The new version of Google's book-shaped foldable phone is better than the original in just about every way. But Samsung still excels at optimizing apps to adapt to the screen when it's folded halfway, which makes a world of a difference when using the phone in different positions.  Overall, I feel the same way about the Galaxy Z Fold 6 as I did when I initially reviewed it in July. The phone's software and its sharp, bright screen make it among the best foldables you can buy -- if you can cope with its eye-watering high price. Read more: Samsung Galaxy S25 Wish List: The Biggest Features I'm Waiting For The Galaxy Z Fold 6 (left) has a narrower cover screen than the Pixel 9 Pro Fold (right) The Pixel 9 Pro Fold may have a larger internal screen compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 6 (8 inches compared to 7.6 inches), but in my opinion, the Z Fold 6 does a better job of ensuring apps conform to the screen when it's folded halfway at a 90-degree angle. That's important because one of the biggest advantages of a foldable phone is the ability to prop the phone up without a kickstand, thanks to its folding screen and hinge. On the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, certain apps such as the camera and video streaming apps like YouTube can shift to the top of half of the screen when the display is propped open like a laptop. (Google calls this Tabletop mode, while Samsung calls it Flex mode.) But the vast majority of apps don't do this. Instead, they stretch across the screen like a waterfall, which isn't the best viewing experience.  The Galaxy Z Fold 6, by comparison, can split any app in this way. And better yet, you can use the bottom portion of the screen as a touchpad to navigate the top half of the display. I've found this useful for managing Spotify without having to pick up my phone, or using the Z Fold 6 as a miniature secondary display so that I can keep my group chats with friends over Discord and Google Chat open on my desk as I'm working throughout the day.  Don't get me wrong; this isn't reason enough to buy a foldable phone like the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Instead, it's kind of an answer to a problem that foldables have created. But I appreciate that Samsung has at least made it so that you don't have to worry about whether apps will function properly when using the Z Fold 6 as it's intended to be used. It's the biggest reason why I'd choose the Galaxy Z Fold 6 over the Pixel 9 Pro Fold personally.  The Galaxy Z Fold 6 can generate images based on sketches.  Samsung introduced a bevy of new Galaxy AI features on the Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 when they debuted in July, including the ability to turn selfies into AI-generated works of art, create polished images from rough sketches, and take advantage of the Z Fold 6's two screens to translate real-world conversations instantly.  The foldables also support previously released Galaxy AI features that let you erase or manipulate objects in photos, translate text messages and phone calls, launch a Google search just by circling an object, and summarize, reformat and translate notes.  Unfortunately, I don't really find myself using these features in everyday life. Samsung's Portrait Studio (for generating artistic versions of your selfies) was a lot of fun to play around with when I first got the Z Fold 6, but the novelty wore off fast. Many Galaxy AI features feel targeted at specific circumstances, such as photo editing and language translation, rather than meaningfully changing the everyday experience.  The version of Galaxy AI that's available today is likely just the beginning. But in the future, I hope Samsung comes up with features that feel more like handy shortcuts for getting things done, rather than niche tools. Circle to Search, which lets you search for nearly anything on your phone's screen by circling it, is a good example of the direction I'd like to see, not just for Samsung's AI but all smartphone-based AI in the future. I also appreciate that Samsung lets you turn off cloud processing for Galaxy AI features for those who want to preserve privacy. If you turn off cloud processing, the experience will be limited considering many features, such as Composer (for writing text messages and emails for you), Sketch to Image (for generating images based on rough drawings) and Circle to Search rely on the cloud. But it's still nice to have a master switch in case you don't care about using these features and want the extra peace of mind.  The Galaxy Z Fold 6 performed well in CNET's battery test.  Like last year's Galaxy Z Fold 5, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 performed well in CNET's video-streaming test -- which is good news considering entertainment is exactly what that giant inner screen is intended for. After streaming a YouTube video for three hours at full brightness on the main 7.6-inch screen, the Galaxy Z Fold 6's battery dropped to 82%.  That's almost on par with the Galaxy Z Fold 5, which dropped to 86% during the same test, and it's better than the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which decreased to 76%. Nonfolding phones like the Galaxy S24 Ultra performed better (89%), but not dramatically so. Samsung phones are known for their bright screens, and that's no different with the Galaxy Z Fold 6. While the internal screens on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold both looked equally luminous at full brightness in sunlight (which is surprising, because I've found the displays on Pixel phones in the past   to be somewhat dim), Samsung's phone looked noticeably brighter indoors at half brightness. That, to me, is more telling because it represents the conditions under which people are likely using their phones most often.  The Galaxy Z Fold 6 has a bright 7.6-inch screen. When it comes to foldable phones, design is more important than usual. Samsung made notable improvements in this regard on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 with its more symmetrical cover screen and lighter build. But not to be outdone, Google dramatically overhauled its foldable, resulting in a phone that's more practical and attractive than the first-generation Pixel Fold, all while packing larger screens.  Which design you prefer depends on your preferences, although I think Google generally has the upper hand. Google's phone has a wider cover screen, which makes it feel more like a regular phone when closed and provides more space for using apps without opening the device. Samsung's cover screen is skinnier, which feels less natural but might be more ideal for those with small hands. Google's phone also lies flatter when unfolded compared to Samsung's, making it look sleeker as a tablet when resting on a table or surface. You can still see the crease on both phones, although it's not always noticeable when viewing the display straight on.  The Galaxy Z Fold 6 (front) and Pixel 9 Pro Fold (back) The Galaxy Z Fold 6's camera system, which consists of a 50-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and 10-megapixel telephoto camera, can take clear and vibrant photos. Compared to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which has a 48-megapixel main camera, 10.5-megapixel ultrawide camera and 10.8-megapixel telephoto camera, it succeeded and fell short depending on the circumstance.  The Pixel 9 Pro Fold performed better when taking colorful photos of still objects and landscapes, and zoomed-in photos looked crisper than those shot on Samsung's phone.  Take a look at the images below taken at a 20x zoom to see what I mean. Google's photo has a lot less noise, and you can see the separation between the bricks much more easily.  Galaxy Z Fold 6 A photo of the top of a church zoomed in at 20x taken on the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Pixel 9 Pro Fold This photo was taken at a 20x zoom on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.  But the photos I captured of people, whether it was portraits taken at night and during a sunny day, or a group of friends chatting in a dim bar, looked better when taken with Samsung's phone.  This photo of my friend Randy is one example. Although it has a bit of a golden tint to it compared to Google's, I think the photo feels more lively. Galaxy Z Fold 6 This photo was taken with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Pixel 9 Pro Fold This image was taken with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Of course, mobile photography can be subjective. Some may prefer more natural-looking photos, while others may appreciate an extra tinge of color.  The Galaxy Z Fold 6 looks almost like a regular phone when closed I didn't intend for this three-month check-in to be a comparison between the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro. But it's hard to ignore Google's new foldable, undoubtedly the biggest challenger to Samsung's, when revisiting the Galaxy Z Fold 6. For me, the Galaxy Z Fold 6's ability to adapt all apps to the screen when it's folded halfway goes a long way in boosting its appeal. But the Pixel 9 Pro's elegant design and larger screens also give it a leg up -- which of these is more important to you depends on your preferences.  The real question is whether the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is worth the extra $100 compared to Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Both devices are painfully expensive, so I'd recommend carefully considering what matters to you most in a phone and letting that guide your decision since you'll be spending a pretty penny either way. If you think you'll be using the phone in the so-called Flex or Tabletop mode often and want a wide variety of apps that work well in that mode, the Z Fold 6 is probably the right choice. But if you care more about having a wider cover screen, you'll likely be happier with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.  Regardless, booting up the Galaxy Z Fold 6 again has reminded me what I really like about Samsung's foldable, and where it still has room to grow. When it comes to the latter, I'd still like to see a lot more from Galaxy AI. Plus, Z Fold 6's high price is still really hard to swallow.  I don't know if Samsung will ever lower the Galaxy Z Fold 6's price. But I'm almost certain Galaxy AI is just in its beginning stages. "

Reviews ethics statement \n    From NBA League Pass to ESPN, TNT, FanDuel Sports Networks and more, you can catch every game during the 2024-25 NBA season without cable from opening night through to the NBA Finals.\n   Basketball is back. After another busy offseason that saw trades of all-stars like Karl-Anthony Towns as recently as earlier this month, it's time for action to go from the Twittersphere to the actual hardwood. The 82-game marathon regular season begins on Tuesday night, runs through the holidays, Christmas Day games and All-Star weekend in February 2025, and concludes in April. The NBA playoffs start their mini-marathon in April and conclude sometime in June with the NBA Finals.  The in-season tournament is back for its second year with teams competing for the NBA Cup. The tournament games start on Nov. 12 and end with a championship game -- the only one that doesn't count toward the regular season standings -- on Dec. 17.  That's a lot of awesome basketball, and NBA fans looking to stream their team throughout the year will need access to a few different services to catch every game. In addition to your regular regional sports network -- the local channel that carries your team's games week in and week out -- you'll also need ABC, ESPN, TNT and NBA TV for nationally televised contests.  The NBA's new media deals, which will see Amazon's Prime Video and NBC/Peacock replace TNT, start next year for the 2025-26 season. Yes, TNT still has the NBA this season.  All out-of-market games will continue to air on NBA League Pass, which is a great choice if you follow a team in a different city from where you live. Getting the service for the full season (with the NBA TV channel included) costs $110, while a \"Premium\" option that includes in-arena feeds in place of commercials and the ability to watch three games at once runs $160 for the season. It's important to note that local fans aren't able to watch their team play on League Pass, as broadcasts of these contests air exclusively on regional sports networks. National games are similarly blacked out. While you absolutely don't need cable to watch basketball this year, it still might be the easiest and cheapest choice depending on where you live. Read more: How to Watch NFL Games With or Without Cable in 2024 Jayson Tatum and the Boston Celtics will look to repeat as champions after winning it all last season.  As usual, die-hard sports fans are beholden to regional sports networks that carry the majority of the games for their local team(s). Examples include MSG in the New York area and Spectrum SportsNet in Los Angeles. These RSNs are usually included in local cable packages, so most cable subscribers never have to worry about gaining access to the broadcasts on these channels: They can simply turn on the TV and watch the game.  Cord-cutting basketball fans have a tougher path. Because of rights agreements, our favorite live TV streaming services like YouTube TV or Hulu with Live TV don't carry many RSNs. DirecTV Stream and Fubo are the exceptions; both offer numerous RSNs, including the FanDuel   Sports channels (formerly Ballys), but they're more expensive than other options. Fubo also still lacks TNT.  Ultimately, depending on your location, getting a cable subscription that includes ESPN, ABC, TNT and the local RSN might actually be cheaper and easier than streaming -- especially if it's bundled with the home internet you'll likely be getting anyway. Read more: DirecTV Stream Review: Expensive, but the Best Option for Streaming NBA and NHL A Bally Sports San Diego microphone.  Diamond Sports Group, which owns what's now called FanDuel Sports Network (formerly known as the Bally Sports regional sports networks), has been dealing with bankruptcy filings, and it remains to be seen what this means for watching basketball on those RSNs this season. FanDuel Sports Network airs games for 13 teams, or close to half the league. For now, games will air on those stations as they always have, but the situation could change.  FanDuel Sports Networks' NBA teams include the Atlanta Hawks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Charlotte Hornets, Detroit Pistons, Indiana Pacers, Los Angeles Clippers, Memphis Grizzlies, Miami Heat, Milwaukee Bucks, Minnesota Timberwolves, Oklahoma City Thunder, Orlando Magic and San Antonio Spurs.  The Dallas Mavericks and New Orleans Pelicans were on FanDuel Sports Network last year, but both have now gone on their own and will make their local games available for free over-the-air (with an antenna).  Read more: Our picks for the best antennas in 2024 The Chicago Bulls also have a new home, with games this season airing on a newly created Chicago Sports Network instead of NBC Sports Chicago. Right now the channel requires a cable or satellite package with a free over-the-air antenna option only available in certain areas (with more promised to be coming soon).  The Phoenix Suns (formerly on Bally Sports) and Utah Jazz (previously on AT&T SportsNet) already announced new partners last year and both have led the charge in making their games available for free with an antenna.  The Houston Rockets (formerly on AT&T SportsNet), meanwhile, are now on Space City Home Network, which the team created in partnership with baseball's Houston Astros after the clubs acquired their local SportsNet channel from Warner Bros. Discovery.  In addition to making their games available locally over-the-air, the Suns and Jazz have also launched new streaming services for those looking to stream in-market. The Suns' streaming service will run $100 for the season (through a \"limited time\" offer, the monthly cost remains $15), while the Jazz's service will run $125.50 for the year (or $20 per month if paying monthly). A Jazz option that also includes the new Utah Hockey Club's NHL games is $175 for the season.  They aren't alone either. Other teams offering their own in-market streaming options include the Portland Trail Blazers (BlazerVision, $120 for the season), Los Angeles Lakers (Spectrum SportsNet Plus, $20 monthly, $195 annually), Los Angeles Clippers (ClipperVision, $20 monthly or $125 for the season) and Washington Wizards (Monumental Sports Network, $20 monthly or $200 annually).  The Brooklyn Nets (YES Network, $20 monthly or $240 annually) and New York Knicks (MSG Plus, $30 monthly, $280 annually) have teamed up on a new joint venture for New York teams called Gotham Sports. This lets you get either team individually or as a bundle together ($320 annually or $42 monthly). The YES Network airs Nets and MLB's Yankees games while MSG Plus has the Knicks plus the NHL's Rangers, Islanders and Devils.  For those who still have teams with FanDuel Sports Network, you can actually get the channel without subscribing to cable. The streaming service offers users in its coverage area a way to stream just the FanDuel Sports Network channels. The service generally costs $20 a month or around $190 a year for your local FanDuel   Sports channel, including NBA and NHL games (plus MLB games in certain areas). In markets where you normally have two different FanDuel   Sports channels, you can choose to only buy one or you can bundle them together for $30 a month.  While the normal pricing is $190 annually, the service is currently offering an option to sign up for a full season in certain markets at $108 for a \"season pass.\"  FanDuel Sports Plus uses your billing ZIP code to determine which channels are available to you, though you'll be able to log into your channels from anywhere in the country. You can check your options at FanDuel Sports Network's website here.  It is worth noting that this option does not include national games like the ones that are broadcast on ABC, ESPN or TNT.  This service is only available for those whose billing ZIP code falls in locations covered by FanDuel Sports Network channels. Users can pay $20 a month or $190 a year for streaming access to their local FanDuel Sports Network channel without cable ($125 if you want just through the season). Those who live in areas covered by multiple   FanDuel Sports networks will be able to bundle them together for $25 or $30 a month or pick one network for $20. Multiview in the NBA app. For NBA fans looking to watch a lot of out-of-market basketball, a subscription to NBA League Pass has plenty to offer. You can get the whole NBA slate for $110 for the season, with commercials and one device, or $160 for the season for a \"Premium\" option that includes in-arena feeds instead of commercials and the ability to watch on three devices at once (though the price is up from $130 last year). There are some new features this year, including multiview which lets you watch multiple games at once in the NBA app.  Those interested in following only a single team can buy a Team Pass for $90 for the season. College students who are actively enrolled can get 40% off the monthly price of the regular League Pass (normally $15 per month).  The catch, of course, with any League Pass plan is \"out-of-market.\" Most fans are in-market, meaning they follow the local team, and unfortunately for them RSNs have broadcast exclusivity in the region that they cover. That means local NBA games are blacked out on NBA League Pass. If you're living in Los Angeles, for example, you won't be able to watch Lakers or Clippers games on NBA League Pass. The same goes for Knicks or Nets fans in New York, Bucks fans in Milwaukee and so on. The only way to watch most of those home team games in your home market is to get a service that has the local RSN, namely Spectrum SportsNet, FanDuel Sports Network SoCal, MSG Network, YES Network or FanDuel Sports Network Wisconsin.  Services like NBA League Pass use IP addresses to block out games in viewers' regions -- you'll just get a black screen or message telling you it's unavailable if you try to watch those games. That's why League Pass is ideal for those who want to follow one or more of the teams based in cities other than their own, aka out-of-market teams, but for local fans it's not as useful.  Some RSNs, particularly the FanDuel Sports Networks and other options mentioned above, will allow you to pay for their channel without signing up for cable or a streaming TV service.  NBA League Pass is perfect for catching out-of-market NBA action. While it doesn't allow you to stream games airing in your local city or on national TV, with its $100 starting price (and bundling of NBA TV), it is ideal for fans looking to keep up with everything happening around the league.  The NBA last year began offering its own spin on the popular NFL RedZone channel with a \"whip around\" show it calls CrunchTime. This show, available for free on the NBA app, bounces around live games and is designed to show you all the action, particularly close contests.  In the past, most of these \"CrunchTime days\" took place on Monday nights, but there were times when the league would stream it on other days. A 2024-25 schedule hasn't yet been released.  You don't need League Pass or any other subscription to watch CrunchTime, making this a more accessible way to get your basketball fix, even if it's just one day a week. You will need the NBA app and to make an NBA ID (both of which are free).  As mentioned, the NBA's new media deals, which will see Amazon's Prime Video and NBC/Peacock replace TNT, start next year for the 2025-26 season. For this season there are no changes when it comes to the major networks.  For those determined to watch their local basketball team without a cable or satellite TV subscription, a live TV streaming service is the best bet. While it is pricey, DirecTV Stream is the best option for most people, particularly those where the local games air on FanDuel Sports Networks or those looking for the YES Network (Nets fans in New York) or Spectrum SportsNet (Lakers fans in Los Angeles).  DirecTV Stream requires its $113-per-month Choice package to get RSNs (that price includes various fees the company levels on top of the sticker price), though this option also includes ABC, ESPN, TNT and NBA TV, so you should be all set for basketball. If you live in a FanDuel area, you could pair a FanDuel   Sports Plus package with something like Sling Orange and save a few bucks per month. Same for those in New York, Phoenix, Utah or Washington, DC, who can pair their RSNs streaming option with a cheaper TV provider.  Sling Orange runs $40 per month and includes ESPN and TNT while FanDuel Sports Network or those local RSN options -- as mentioned above -- generally run $20 to $30 per month depending on your area and your team. Getting NBA TV runs $11 per month with the Sports Extra add-on.  All told, however, you'd be paying $51 monthly for Sling (including the add-on for NBA TV) and another $20 or $30 for an RSN, which could be a sizable savings compared with DirecTV. It is worth noting that you will need to switch between different apps to stream everything.  Another possible pairing is Fubo, which has the FanDuel Sports RSNs as well as a handful of others, and a streaming service like Max. Fubo lacks TNT, but Max has begun streaming live sports under its Bleacher Report (B/R) Sports banner. You will need to get a Max subscription, which starts at $10 per month for the ad-supported version. Combined with Fubo, that's $95 per month for live basketball.  Below is a chart of all of the NBA teams in the US and their corresponding RSNs.  Note: None of the (US-based) services carry the RSN for the Toronto Raptors (TSN). Fans in the US looking to watch Pascal Siakam and co. need to use NBA League Pass to get all the games that aren't either on your local RSN or on a US national broadcast. Some key takeaways: NBC Sports Washington is now the Monumental Sports Network. The Houston Rockets now play on Space City Home Network (formerly AT&T SportsNet Southwest).  DirecTV Stream is expensive. It's the priciest of the five major live TV streaming services, but it's also the one with the most RSNs. Its cheapest $90-a-month Entertainment package includes ESPN, ABC and TNT. You'll need to move up to the $113-a-month Choice plan to get any available RSN as well as NBA TV. You can use its channel lookup tool to see which local channels and RSNs are available in your area.  Aside from DirecTV Stream and Fubo, the odds are long that a live TV streaming service carries the RSN for your local team's games, which makes the other four services better bets for watching nationally televised games.  It's worth mentioning that for the in-season tournament, quarterfinal games on Dec. 4 and 5 will air on TNT, the semifinals on Dec. 7 will air on TNT and ESPN, and the championship on Dec. 9 will air on ABC.  Sling TV's Orange plan includes ESPN, and both plans offer TBS too, but neither of them gives you access to ABC or the regional sports networks found on more expensive services. NBA TV is available as part of the Sports Extra add-on, which costs $11 a month for either the Blue or Orange plan or $15 for the combined Orange-and-Blue plan. The individual plans cost $40 a month each, and the Orange-and-Blue plan costs $55 a month (in some areas, Blue may be $45 per month and the combo will run $60 monthly). You can see which local channels you get here. It's worth noting that ABC is included with the Blue plan in some markets, the Orange plan includes ESPN3 access which allows for watching those games. YouTube TV costs $73 a month and offers six RSNs for basketball, along with all of the national broadcasts including NBA TV. Plug in your ZIP code on its welcome page to see which local networks and RSNs are available in your area. Fubo costs $80 per month for its Pro option and offers most RSNs for basketball. It also includes ESPN but not TNT -- which might be a problem for some basketball fans. Check out which local networks and RSNs it offers here. Hulu Plus Live TV costs $83 a month and carries a handful of RSNs for basketball, along with ESPN, ABC and TNT, but not NBA TV. Click the \"View all channels in your area\" link at the bottom of its welcome page to see which local networks and RSNs are available where you live. Each live TV streaming service offers a free trial, allows you to cancel anytime and requires a solid internet connection. Looking for more information?

Learn more  Following a couple of weeks of preseason, the 2024-2025 NBA regular season tips off this week. There are no new surprises this year regarding how to watch NBA games, so if you found a way to tune into the games last season, those same options should work again this year. However, if you're unsure where to start or find that your go-to cable, antenna, or streaming subscription is missing a key channel, we've got you covered. Keep reading to learn how to tune into every nationally broadcast game this year. Plus, we'll highlight the best way to watch out-of-market games from home. We've broken down everything you need to know across several streaming services since each one is a little bit different and might cater more to your specific needs. Some are cheaper and only carry certain channels; others are more expensive but will grant you access to the most NBA coverage this season. We've highlighted two of the best streaming services for comprehensive NBA coverage with \"Best Value\" and \"Staff Pick\" stickers, so they're easy to find below. The 2024 NBA preseason ran from October 4 to October 18, 2024. The 2024-25 regular season tips off on October 22, 2024, and will run until April 13, 2025. The Play-In tournament lasts from April 15 to 18 and is immediately followed by the start of the Playoffs on April 19. The Conference Semifinals will start in early May, followed by the May Conference Finals. The NBA Finals will tip off on June 5, 2025. You can watch nationally televised NBA regular season games on ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, and NBA TV. TNT usually broadcasts games on Tuesday and Thursday nights, while ESPN games are typically scheduled for Wednesdays and Fridays. ABC usually gets in the mix at some point each season. Last year, the network aired NBA games on select Saturdays and Sundays starting in December. ABC will also broadcast all 2025 NBA Finals games. If you already have a pay-TV provider with access to ESPN, ABC, or TNT, you can live stream each station's NBA content via their respective apps. Just log in with your credentials. It's important to remember that many ESPN games are not included with an ESPN Plus subscription since the streaming service is its own entity and not just a complete live stream of the network. For everything else that isn't showing on broadcast TV, you'll want to know about NBA League Pass. You can purchase a monthly or annual subscription to watch every out-of-market NBA game live, plus the ability to go back and watch condensed replays. NBA League Pass includes NBA TV, which shows some games exclusively via local affiliate broadcasts. If you don't have a cable or satellite subscription, you can sign up for one of the live TV streaming services featured below. The list of streaming services offering access to all four broadcast sources of NBA games is thin, but we've scoped out your best options. You know best when it comes to what you're looking for in a live TV plan, but basketball fanatics will find the most comprehensive national broadcast coverage with Sling TV and DirecTV Stream. Additionally, DirecTV Stream and Fubo offer solid regional sports network options. Most of these services — including Sling TV, DirecTV Stream, and Fubo — also allow you to subscribe to NBA League Pass through their apps, so you can have everything in one place. Sling TV includes ESPN/ESPN2 and TNT as part of its Orange plan for $40 a month. This version of Sling doesn't offer ABC, but NBA games airing on that network are typically simulcast on ESPN3, which is included with Sling. You can also fill the gap by adding NBA TV to your plan through the Sports Extra package for an additional $11 a month, which brings your total to $51 a month. Sling Orange offers 35 live channels, and Sports Extra will add an extra 12 options. New Sling members can get their first month of service for $20 off, which helps make Sling one of the cheapest options for streaming the NBA. \n                                      For just the essentials without any extra fluff, Sling TV is the streaming service you're looking for. It's more customizable than other plans, with three options you can choose from, so you pay for only what you need. New members get their first month for half-off.\n                                    \n                                   DirecTV Stream is one of the most comprehensive NBA live streaming cable alternatives out there and will enable you to watch every nationally broadcast NBA game this year, although the price tag can get a bit hefty. DirecTV Stream Entertainment subscriptions start at $87/month and will give you access to TNT, ESPN/ESPN2, ABC, and 90+ other channels. To access NBA TV, you'll need to get the Sports Pack add-on, which will cost $102/month in total, and add another 20 or so channels to your lineup. However, if you sign up right now, you can get both for $87/month for two months before your subscription renews at the standard $102/month rate. The service offers a five-day free trial. \n                                  Previously known as AT&T TV, DirecTV Stream offers streaming access to a large selection of live channels, including most key networks typically found in traditional cable packages.\n                                 Fubo is another sports-friendly TV streaming service. However, it lacks TNT, so you'll need to find another option for Tuesdays and Thursdays. But you'll get ABC, ESPN/ESPN2, and over 100 other channels on the base Pro package ($80 monthly, before potential discounts). Fubo Extra, an $8 add-on, includes NBA TV. Fubo Extra is included with the Fubo Elite with Sports Plus package, which costs $100 and adds dozens more channels. The streamer offers a seven-day free trial and $20 off the first month of service. \n                                  Fubo is the streaming service for sports fans. Its huge library of channels includes regional and international sports leagues, setting it apart from the competition. You can also tack on additional programming to your plan, but it'll cost you extra.\n                                 You can get ABC, ESPN/ESPN2, and TNT with a $83 monthly Hulu + Live TV subscription. Unfortunately, Hulu + Live TV doesn't offer any NBA TV options, even via add-ons. In total, subscriptions offer at least 95 live channels. Hulu is currently running a promo that will give you your first three months of Live TV coverage for $60/month before subscriptions renew at the standard rate. All plans are bundled with ESPN Plus, Disney Plus, and on-demand Hulu. \n                                  Hulu + Live TV includes over 90 channels, along with Hulu's on-demand library and access to Disney Plus and ESPN Plus. Adding live TV drives up the price significantly, but it's a rolling one-month contract that you're free to cancel at any time. As live TV services go, this is one of the best.\n                                 Max has a new B/R Sports add-on, which is currently free with any regular Max subscription but will eventually cost an additional $10 a month (the date is still TBA). The B/R Sports add-on features several live sports options, including TNT's NBA games. Max subscriptions start at $10 a month or $100 a year for ad-supported plans. In addition to regular season games, the add-on will live stream games from the NBA Playoffs and the Western Conference Finals. \n                                  Max is a premium service for fans of prestige television, iconic films, and unscripted programs. Prices start at $10 a month for ad-supported, $17 for ad-free, and $21 if you want to view in 4K.\n                                 TNT, ESPN, ABC, and NBA TV are the national broadcast partners of the NBA, but they only show select games throughout the season. If you want to follow additional games, subscribe to NBA League Pass to stream out-of-market regular season games from the entire league. League Pass starts at $17 a month or $110 for a full season; for that price, you can stream the NBA TV channel and stream live games every night with commercials. You can step it up with NBA League Pass Premium for $25 a month or $160 a year. This plan offers commercial-free viewing and lets you watch on two devices simultaneously. The price to sign up for NBA League Pass decreases as the year goes on. Games for teams in your local market will be blacked out on NBA League Pass, as will national broadcasts from ESPN, TNT, and ABC. \n                                  NBA League Pass lets you stream out of market NBA games all season long. Note: Nationally televised games and local teams are not available live.\n                                 Comprehensive NBA coverage isn't available overseas, which used to mean missing out on games when you're traveling abroad. Fortunately, you can keep up with most of your streaming subscriptions with the help of a VPN. Short for virtual private network, a VPN will allow websites to see your device as though it's connecting from within whichever country you want. That means you could set it to connect through a United States server to access your usual live TV streaming services from abroad. Since these subscriptions require US methods of payment, this will work best for Americans who just happen to be outside of the US at the moment. Don't have a VPN? The best VPN we've tested and have been using for years for streaming and beefing up our online security is Express VPN. It's the best investment for sports fans if you know you'll want to watch more international streams for future seasons and events. If you're unsatisfied, there's a hassle-free 30-day money-back guarantee. Want to learn more about the product? Take a look at our ExpressVPN review. \n                                      With its consistent performance, reliable security, and expansive global streaming features, ExpressVPN is the best VPN out there, excelling in every spec and offering many advanced features that makes it exceptional. Better yet, you can save up to 49% and get an extra three months for free today.\n                                     Highlights Note: The use of VPNs is illegal in certain countries, and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content might constitute a breach of the terms of use for certain services.

Learn more  College basketball is officially back, and both the men's and women's regular seasons are underway. Games are spread across several networks and streaming services, but we've scoured them all so you don't have to. Keep reading to learn where to watch college basketball, including which live streaming services will allow you to watch the most games. A little more than six months after the thrilling March Madness tournaments, which culminated in UConn winning the men's national championship and South Carolina winning the women's national championship, college basketball returns. Among the many highly-anticipated narratives this year is that of Paige Bueckers, Azzi Fudd, and the rest of the UConn women's team, who were bounced by Iowa in the Final Four last year. UConn's men's team is also one to watch as the Huskies look to threepeat their national championship status without Donovan Clingan, who departed for the NBA after last season and is now playing for the Portland Trail Blazers. Below, we've put together everything you need to know about watching college basketball in the 2024/2025 season. All four cord-cutting cable-replacement services we recommend made our roundup of the best sports streaming services. Men's and women's regular season games are spread across several networks and streaming services. The bulk of the regular season games will be available on ESPN Plus, the SEC Network, or the ACC Network. Select games, like the upcoming UConn vs. North Carolina women's game on November 15, will be shown on traditional TV networks like ESPN2. ESPN, ESPN3, ESPNU, CBS, CBS Sports Network, NBC, FS1, FS2, FOX, TNT, Big Ten Network, and ABC will also get in on the action at various points this season, among other networks. Additionally, some games will stream on Peacock. Games will occasionally air on other networks, but the ones we've highlighted above will feature the bulk of the broadcasts. The wide variety of channels and networks means that cord-cutting fans of college basketball looking to watch most men's and women's games will find the most success by combining an ESPN Plus subscription with a live TV package, like Sling TV, DirecTV Stream, or Hulu + Live TV (the latter of which includes ESPN Plus). ESPN Plus is one of the more affordable sports streaming services out there. Subscriptions start at $12/month or $120/year. Through December 2, you can lock in an annual plan for just $100. The streaming service doesn't have every college basketball game, but it live streams the most men's and women's games out of any service or channel, including coverage that is exclusive to ESPN Plus. Our ESPN Plus guide has more information. \n                                  ESPN Plus is designed for sports, giving subscribers access to live MLB, NHL, NFL, soccer, golf, and UFC fights. You can pay $12 monthly or go for an annual deal, which saves you about $24 a year. There's also a bundle with Hulu and Disney Plus, which offers an even better discount.\n                                 When it comes to watching non-ESPN Plus games, live streaming services like Sling TV, DirecTV Stream, and Hulu + Live TV have most of the relevant channels, although you'll need to subscribe to higher-tier plans or add-ons in most cases to access some niche channels, like the SEC and ACC Networks. Sling TV is one of the cheaper options out there. Subscriptions start at $40/month for the base tiers. Both Sling Blue and Sling Orange carry TNT. Sling Orange offers ESPN, ESPN2, and ESPN3, while Sling Blue carries local channels (like ABC, NBC, and FOX) in select regions. Sling Blue also offers FS1. You can combine the two plans for $55/month and get add-ons like the Sling Orange Sports Extra (for $11/month) to access the SEC Network, ACC Network, and ESPNU, among other channels. \n                                      For just the essentials without any extra fluff, Sling TV is the streaming service you're looking for. It's more customizable than other plans, with three options you can choose from, so you pay for only what you need. New members get their first month for half-off.\n                                    \n                                   With the exception of ESPN Plus and regional games, DirecTV Stream will allow you to watch almost every college basketball game this season with the help of add-on packages and several subscription tiers. The streaming service has similar offerings to cable without the long-term contracts. Plans start at $87/month for the base Entertainment package, but college sports fans will want to get the Sports Pack, which includes the SEC Network, ACC Network, ESPNU, and tons of other sports channels. This costs an extra $15/month (making it about $102/month in total), but DirecTV Stream will knock $15/month off your first two months of service if you sign up for the package right now. All DirecTV Stream plans include a five-day free trial. \n                                  Previously known as AT&T TV, DirecTV Stream offers streaming access to a large selection of live channels, including most key networks typically found in traditional cable packages.\n                                 Hulu + Live TV is another popular live TV streaming package that includes ESPN Plus, Disney Plus, and on-demand Hulu in addition to its lineup of live channels. Subscriptions start at $83/month, but customers can get their first three months for just $60/month. In addition to the standard channels found in most live streaming cable alternatives, Hulu + Live TV also offers SEC Network and ACC Network options. \n                                  Hulu + Live TV includes over 90 channels, along with Hulu's on-demand library and access to Disney Plus and ESPN Plus. Adding live TV drives up the price significantly, but it's a rolling one-month contract that you're free to cancel at any time. As live TV services go, this is one of the best.\n                                 Select games, particularly men's college basketball, will air on Peacock. These will not be simulcast on NBC, so you'll need to get the app in order to watch. Subscriptions start at $8/month, but you can upgrade for $14/month to access NBC live streams (which will allow you to watch the NBC broadcast games) and ad-free on-demand content. \n                                  Peacock is a convenient streaming source for hit NBC TV shows, Universal movies, and select sports like Sunday Night Football. Prices start at $8 a month, with additional discounts on annual plans.\n                                 College basketball fans traveling outside of the US might have a hard time finding watch options while abroad. Fortunately, they can keep up with their usual streaming services with the help of a VPN (virtual private network). VPNs let people alter the virtual location on their electronic devices, meaning that they can access their go-to apps and websites from anywhere. They're also strong ways to boost online security and protect privacy on the internet, even if they're just being used at home. Not sure where to start when it comes to VPNs? ExpressVPN is our go-to recommendation. It's easy to use, has lots of cybersecurity perks, and offers a hassle-free 30-day money-back guarantee. Check out our ExpressVPN review for additional information, and keep reading to learn how to use a VPN. \n                                  With its consistent performance, reliable security, and expansive global streaming features, ExpressVPN is the best VPN out there, excelling in every spec and offering many advanced features that makes it exceptional. Better yet, you can save up to 49% and get an extra three months for free today.\n                                 Note: Using VPNs is illegal in certain countries, and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content might constitute a breach of the terms of use for certain services. Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal use of VPNs. Jump to"

            "content": "New federal filings reveal a pro-Trump super PAC raked in millions of dollars in donations from major business names, including venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz. According to the Federal Election Commission documents, Andreessen and Horowitz each donated $2.5 million to the \"Right for America\" PAC. According to its website, the PAC's goal is \"to ensure President Donald J. Trump is victorious in the 2024 presidential election.\" Andreessen and Horowitz announced their support for Trump in July during an episode of the \"The Ben & Marc Show\" podcast. Andreessen said that Biden's plan for taxing unrealized capital gains was the \"final straw\" for his endorsing Trump. \"This makes startups completely implausible, because why on Earth is anybody going to go do this instead of going to work for Google and getting paid a lot of money every year in cash?\" Andreessen said in July. Meanwhile, Horowitz earlier this month said in a memo to employees that he and his wife would be making a \"significant donation\" to entities supporting the Kamala Harris campaign. He didn't endorse Harris but said in the memo that Harris had been a good friend to him and his wife. In July, Horowitz said he and Andreessen had enjoyed a dinner with Trump, where they discussed topics including AI and crypto. \"For Little Tech, we think Donald Trump is actually the right choice,\" Horowitz said in the July podcast, before adding: \"And sorry, Mom. I know you're going to be mad at me for this, but we had to do it.\" Andreessen and Horowitz's donations to a pro-Trump PAC are part of a shift among some Silicon Valley big names who previously supported Democratic candidates and now support the Republican candidate. Other tech titans have come out in vocal support of Trump, such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who began campaigning on behalf of the former president after a failed assassination attempt in July. Musk formed his own \"America PAC\" in support of Trump, which Business Insider previously reported has spent more than $100 million on the election. The latest \"America PAC\" filing, released Tuesday, shows the Tesla CEO contributed nearly $75 million to the PAC between July and September. Andreessen, in particular, had been a vocal advocate for Democratic candidates, including Barack Obama in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. Other \"Right for America\" donors include Isaac Perlmutter, the former chairperson of Marvel Entertainment, and his wife, Laura, who each donated $2,450,000. Marc Rowan, the CEO of Apollo Global Management, donated $1 million. Representatives for Andreessen Horowitz and the Right for America PAC did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider. Jump to"

            "content": "Sports fans with money to spare can now reap returns from their favorite leagues thanks to a new investment offering from Morgan Stanley. The Parametric Custom Core Sports League strategy is a portfolio that allows high-net-worth fans to invest a minimum of $250,000 in an index of companies tied to major sports leagues. The companies comprise a select group of large-cap US stocks with the biggest sponsorship, media, or ad partnerships with each major sports league. The offering involves 13 of the biggest sports leagues, from the NFL and NBA to the US Open and Formula 1. It also includes Men's and Women's Division I College Basketball. The bank's wealth management arm announced the new portfolio on Thursday, citing a big opportunity to capitalize on fans seeking more engagement and investment with their favorite sports. \"We see the demand from our clients that are asking about ways to invest in sports,\" Sandra Richards, managing director and head of Morgan Stanley's Global Sports and Entertainment Division, told CNBC. \"And it's going to continue.\" Richards said the idea came from a client who requested the bank make a portfolio with exposure to certain sports. \"We saw that there was a bigger opportunity to do something here,\" Richards told CNBC.  The bank said it will use data from Nielsen Sports to monitor the companies' exposure to leagues, and that the portfolio will have similar risks as the S&P 500. Sports as an investment have become a hot and growing asset class.  High-profile billionaires like Marc Lasry and Steve Cohen could pump as much as $3 billion into the PGA Tour, a report said earlier this year. The owners of storied franchises like the Yankees, meanwhile, have seen their wealth balloon as the team's valuation has soared amid increased competition over broadcast rights and revenue from sports betting. Research also suggests that investing in sports teams is a good move, since they're relatively recession-proof and often perform well during market downturns and even better in bull markets. Other big Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs, Citi, and JPMorgan have also launched offerings to help wealthy clients tap into sports investing. Last year, Goldman Sachs unveiled a new unit of dealmakers to pitch investments in teams and stadiums to wealthy clients. Jump to"

            "content": "Netflix showed investors once again that it is the king of streaming. In its third-quarter results released Thursday, the entertainment giant added over 5 million new subscribers and beat analyst expectations for a third straight quarter. It reported revenue of $9.8 billion, a 15% increase year over year, and profit growth of 41% year over year. The crackdown on passwords and growth in advertising-based subscriptions contributed to Netflix's success this quarter. Company executives and industry experts say growth in Asia had a role to play as well. \"You've got Japan. You've got Korea. You've got Thailand. You've got India,\" Gregory Peters, the co-CEO of Netflix, said in the earnings call. \"This represents, again, that decade-plus investment in those creative communities, working with local storytellers there and making sure that they have the capability to tell their stories in a compelling way.\" In a shareholder letter on Thursday, Netflix wrote that Asia Pacific had the largest revenue growth rate of all regions, at 19%, compared to the same period last year. Revenue growth in North America and Europe, Middle East, and Africa was tied at 16% each. Some industry experts who reacted to Netflix's earnings also pointed to its local content creation strategy. \"One of the main things about Netflix is just what they have done internationally,\" Ben Silverman, the chairman and co-CEO of Propagate Content, said in a CNBC interview on Thursday. Instead of just re-expressing content from the US, Netflix has also commissioned content in local languages for local markets, Silverman said. Netflix's greatest success story in the region has been the South Korean production \"Squid Game.\" The first season of the game show-style drama, which was released in 2021 and follows a group of debt-riddled contestants competing in deadly games for cash, has been watched 265 million times globally to date. It's also amassed 2.2 billion hours of watch time, making it the streamer's most-watched show of all time, according to Netflix data. In addition to \"Squid Game,\" the Korean drama \"All of Us Are Dead\" is also on the list of Netflix's 10 most-watched non-English language shows. The rest of the shows on the list are European and Mexican productions, three of which are different seasons of the Spanish hit \"Money Heist.\" Last week, the Japanese manga series \"Dan Da Dan\" charted among the 10 most-watched shows in the US, Netflix data shows. The variety of original content available of Netflix, and early investments in Japan and Korea, are playing a role in its growth, Dhivya T, the lead analyst of content and platform insights at Media Partners Asia, told Business Insider. \"Netflix's edge may be in its consistency and persistence in Asia,\" the analyst said. Netflix appears committed to experimenting with different approaches to local content to meet local market needs, whether it's high-budget originals, licensing free TV dramas, or post-theatrical movies, the analyst said. \"Beyond content, lower pricing and a concerted crackdown on password sharing has also helped boost Netflix's sub growth in Asia's emerging markets over the past year,\" she added. Netflix rose 5% in after-hours trading on Thursday. The company's stock is up 46% this year. Jump to"

Kent, who has been married to Dimon for over 40 years, went door-to-door to speak to voters in Lansing, a Harris campaign official told The New York Times' Maggie Haberman. Michigan is one of the swing states the Democratic Party needs to win to secure an election victory. \"I'm proud to be a supporter and to spend time talking with voters and encouraging them to turn out to vote for the Harris-Walz ticket,\" Kent said in a statement provided by the Harris campaign to The Wall Street Journal's Andrew Restuccia. In the statement, Kent added that she believes Harris and Walz \"are fighting for a hopeful, optimistic future for all Americans.\" Representatives for Kent and the Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. JPMorgan declined to comment. Dimon hasn't publicly endorsed a presidential candidate this election. The JPMorgan chief told Bloomberg in an interview on October 8 that he was still thinking about whether he should endorse a candidate. \"I'm a citizen. I can vote. I can say what I want. I've never been endorsing candidates. But I am thinking through what I want to say or do,\" Dimon said. Harris' rival, former President Donald Trump, said he would consider appointing Dimon as Treasury Secretary during an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek that was published in July. \"I have a lot of respect for Jamie Dimon,\" Trump told the outlet. But just a week after the interview was published, Trump walked back his remarks, saying in a Truth Social post that he \"never discussed, or thought of\" having Dimon as his Treasury Secretary. Then on October 4, Trump posted a photo touting Dimon's endorsement of him on Truth Social. A JPMorgan spokesperson quickly denied Trump's claim, telling BI's Grace Eliza Goodwin that Dimon \"has not endorsed a candidate.\" Kent has donated more than $250,000 to the Harris campaign and the Democratic National Committee this year, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Harris has won the support of several powerful women in business and the entertainment industry. In September, Taylor Swift endorsed Harris, calling the vice president a \"steady-handed, gifted leader.\" A month later, Harris got an endorsement from Beyoncé, months after the singer granted the Harris team permission to use her song \"Freedom\" on the campaign trail. Harris has also received support from powerful philanthropists like Melinda French Gates and Laurene Powell Jobs. \"There is so much riding on the election in November,\" French Gates wrote in a July X post endorsing Harris. \"We need a leader who will stand up for reproductive freedom. A leader who understands that supporting caregivers leads to healthier families and a stronger economy. A leader who knows that when women have their full power in society, we all thrive,\" she wrote. Jump to"

            "content": "Saudi Arabia is pulling back on its global spending spree to focus on domestic investments. Yasir Al Rumayyan, governor of the Public Investment Fund (PIF), said on Tuesday the kingdom planned to reduce the proportion of foreign investments made by the sovereign wealth fund from 30% to about 18% of its portfolio. \"We're more focused on the domestic economy and we've been achieving and doing so many big things,\" Al Rumayyan told delegates at the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh. Saudi Arabia's annual business conference has been dubbed \"Davos in the desert\" in a nod to the World Economic Forum meeting in Switzerland each January. The absolute dollar amount for overseas deals was still increasing, the PIF chief said. In recent years, the PIF has pumped billions into high-profile assets, including global sports teams, entertainment, airport infrastructure, and Uber. The fund's assets are worth about $925 billion. The spending is part of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 plan to reduce its economy's dependence on oil and transform the country into a significant global economic player. Investors have flocked to the FII conference in previous years to take advantage of the multi-billion dollar deals struck at the event. The total at last year's conference reached almost $18 billion, the Saudi Press Agency reported. The kingdom has already been slowing its cash flows and telling foreign fund managers to invest more in Saudi Arabia if they want to secure deals. The PIF's traded stocks in the US fell from about $35 billion at the end of 2023 to $20.6 billion at June 30, The Financial Times reported. Al Rumayyan said that investors were already changing their approach. \"People used to come to us and ask for money. We are now seeing a shift from people wanting to take our money to people wanting to co-invest.\" The PIF governor also spoke about Saudi Arabia's ambitions to become a top destination for AI companies and investors, saying that the technology's economic impact made it a driver of national power. \"We either have discussions or initial discussions to invest in AI and the reason why we are investing in AI is Saudi Arabia is very well positioned to be a global hub, not only a regional hub,\" Al Rumayyan said. The technology could add nearly $20 trillion to the global economy by 2030, he added. In September, Saudi Arabia held the third Global AI Summit, attracting a host of high-profile leaders and dealmakers. The PIF is also in talks to partner with prestigious venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz on an AI fund, with a potential value of $40 billion, Bloomberg reported. The new focus on domestic investment comes as Saudi Arabia's spending on Neom, its futuristic megacity in the desert, hit $1 trillion. Neom's scope appears to have been scaled back as the financial realities of the ambitious project hit home. Experts say Saudi has struggled to attract the foreign investment needed to fund the project's lofty goals. A select group of guests were recently invited to visit Sindalah, a luxury island resort in the Red Sea that is one of the first parts of Neom to become reality. Jump to"

During Friday night's Game 4, the Lynx fought back and kept the teams from going into overtime once again when Bridget Carleton drew a foul in the final two seconds and made both of her free throws, leaving the Lynx with an 82-80 victory on their Minnesota home court.

Learn more  The final leg of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour is underway as the singer-songwriter returns to North America for one last stretch of performances. She finished her final London shows in August and will tour Canada and a few remaining US cities until December. If you're hoping to attend, we've compiled all of the details of The Eras Tour, including how to get Taylor Swift tickets. Swift's Eras Tour has taken the world by storm since March 2023. The three-plus-hour tour features hits from each of Swift's album eras, from \"Lover\" to her Grammy Award-winning \"Midnights.\" Each show also features surprise songs and occasional guests, so fans never quite know what they're in for. Swift released her latest album, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" in April, and the Swiftie hype has continued throughout the summer.  Getting tickets has become its own battle and many fans have waited hours in the Ticketmaster queue to hopefully snag some seats, if they could get a presale ticket code in the first place. So far, Swift's tour has passed through various cities in the US, Europe, Australia, Latin America, and Asia, among other regions. As Swift approaches her last tour dates, which will see her take her final bow in Canada, tickets remain hard to come by. Below, we've put together a guide on everything to know about The Eras Tour, including the tour schedule, ticket purchasing details, resale ticket prices, and the concert film streaming options. You can also peruse resale vendors like StubHub and Vivid Seats at your leisure. The Eras tour returned to the US on October 18 in Miami. In addition to the Miami shows, Swift scheduled multiple dates in New Orleans and Indianapolis. On November 14, Swift will head to Canada for several shows in Toronto and Vancouver. All North American shows start at 7 p.m. local time. Original standard tickets for Taylor Swift's 2024 tour sold out long ago for both international and domestic dates. All US tickets and many international tickets were sold through Ticketmaster, although select international locations used different services.  Tickets for most dates are available on resale websites like StubHub and Vivid Seats. These are generally higher-priced than the originals, which are no longer available. Keep in mind that some countries have rules regarding reselling tickets. Ticket prices vary by date and location. European resale tickets tended to be a bit cheaper than North American resale tickets and some of the cheapest tickets have restricted views. When it comes to North American shows, the cheapest StubHub tickets at the time of writing range from $1,315 (Toronto, Canada on November 16) to $1,880 (Toronto, Canada, on November 23). On Vivid Seats, the cheapest Taylor Swift tickets on these dates start at $1,386 and $2,123, respectively. Most of the cheapest tickets on StubHub are priced between $1,400 and $1,800. The two resale vendors generally have similarly priced offerings, but this varies from show to show.  Resale ticket prices have fluctuated over the past month. Right before the Eras Tour started back up in North America, prices dropped to surprising lows. On October 18, the cheapest StubHub listings for the remaining tour dates ranged from $763 to $1,665. The prices surged again around Swift's North American tour dates, especially leading up to Indianapolis, and at one point, the cheapest tickets across StubHub and Vivid Seats ranged from $2,207 to $2,506. At the time of writing on November 1, the cheapest listings have dropped back under $2,000. We have been tracking resale ticket prices for the Eras Tour over the past seven months and have routinely seen some of the cheapest listings e $2,000 for US tour dates. Taylor Swift has a variety of opening acts, from up-and-coming singers to established groups. Opening acts vary by date. In the US and Canada, Gracie Abrams will be the opening act. For the European leg of the tour, Paramore opened for Swift. Earlier in the tour, Swift had Sabrina Carpenter, Phoebe Bridgers, MUNA, HAIM, and more open for her. Taylor Swift has already added additional stops to her tour due to popular demand, including her US tour dates this fall. She also added additional dates to some of her European city stops, including bonus performances in France and the United Kingdom, among other locations. During her 100th show, a mid-June performance in Liverpool, Swift acknowledged that the tour would conclude in December. \"The celebration of the 100th show for me means this is the very first time I've ever acknowledged to myself and admitted that this tour is going to end in December,\" Swift told the crowd in a moment that was widely captured and posted across social media. This statement means that the Eras Tour is unlikely to extend past 2024, but we'll keep this guide updated if Swift announces any changes (or additions) to her tour lineup. Taylor Swift was originally scheduled to play three Eras Tour shows from August 9 to 11, 2024, in Vienna, Austria. However, the shows were canceled after Austrian officials confirmed that multiple individuals were arrested on suspicion of planning an attack at one of the shows. As of August 12, no other Eras Tours performances have been canceled.  It's good news for fans of \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" Swift's most recent album that dropped on April 19, 2024. Swift is incorporating several of the new tracks into the Eras Tour, as evidenced by the first shows of her European leg. \"The Tortured Poets Department\" songs currently featured on tour include \"But Daddy I Love Him,\" \"So High School,\" \"Down Bad,\" \"Fortnight,\" \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?,\" \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived,\" and \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.\" Since the Eras Tour is already pretty long, this means that Swift is also cutting down a few songs from past Eras that previously made the tour setlist. The songs that were removed from the setlist include \"The Archer,\" \"Long Live,\" \"The 1,\" \"The Last Great American Dynasty,\" \"'Tis the Damn Season,\" and \"Tolerate It.\"  If you'd rather watch The Eras Tour from home, you could always stream it on Disney+.

During Friday night's Game 4, the Lynx fought back and kept the teams from going into overtime once again when Bridget Carleton drew a foul in the final two seconds and made both of her free throws, leaving the Lynx with an 82-80 victory on their Minnesota home court. Since the Liberty is the top-seeded team, the tie-breaking Game 5 returns to New York. The Liberty, helmed by Breanna Stewart, are vying for their first-ever championship title. While the Lynx have four titles, this is their first time at the Finals since 2017 and star Napheesa Collier's first-ever Finals appearance.

The network's WNBA Countdown coverage begins a full hour before, at 7 p.m. If you don't have ESPN through cable, you can live stream the game and network through a live TV service. Sling TV, Fubo, and DirecTV Stream are three popular options that made the cut on our roundup of the best sports streaming services. At $40/month, Sling TV is the most affordable option tonight. Sling's Orange plan carries ESPN and 34 other live channels. Right now, first-time customers can get half-off their first month, meaning that it will just be $20 up front. \n                                      For just the essentials without any extra fluff, Sling TV is the streaming service you're looking for. It's more customizable than other plans, with three options you can choose from, so you pay for only what you need. New members get their first month for half-off.\n                                    \n                                   DirecTV Stream and Fubo are two other sports-friendly live TV options with ESPN and tons of other live channels.

Our favorite is ExpressVPN, an easy-to-use option with a 30-day money-back guarantee and lots of other benefits, which we break down in our ExpressVPN review. Since the streaming options we've recommended today require US methods of payment, this option will work best for Americans who are just traveling abroad right now and hoping to access their subscriptions.

I thought moving to the city could amplify my journalism career, lead to greater opportunities, and give me new experiences. But uncertainty came with the dream. Could I make it work? My worst fear was being financially uncertain in New York. I really think that would be hell on earth. So I took some steps before I moved to ensure that did not happen. When I moved to Washington, DC, as a student, my parents cosigned the lease for my first apartment. Even after I graduated, they paid my rent for a year until I got on my feet. But moving to New York was all on me, and my credit was pulled everywhere I went. There was no way around it. Here's how I made it work: I did my homework. I lived on Google, researching neighborhoods, apartments, and rent prices. For every neighborhood I considered, I searched the area for grocery stores, post offices, pharmacies, and restaurants — and, of course, the subway lines. I knew I would not have a car, so I wanted to ensure that necessities would be nearby.  To find my apartment, I used a real-estate agent. After doing the research and learning about apartment scams, I decided that using an agent was the safest way to go. My agent charged one month's rent, which the apartment building paid for. Some local buildings can charge more than that, up to 10% of the annual rent. When you consider the rent prices in New York, that can really add up. Thankfully, in my case, the apartment building paid for the fee, though that's not always the case in the city's unique apartment market. I traveled to New York twice to meet with my real-estate agent and look at apartments and neighborhoods, including Brooklyn's sprawling areas, to get a feel for the city. I did not want to pick an apartment sight unseen or move into a neighborhood I knew nothing about.  I hired a moving company with several good reviews. It would be moving my life for me, so I wanted to ensure it was a reputable company.  Just like I had for my emergency fund, I opened a bank account for the move. I knew that I would hire movers to transport my things from Washington to New York (a long-distance move), but there was also the security deposit and first month's rent for my apartment. And none of it was cheap. When you hear that everything is more expensive in New York, they are not kidding. I moved four hours up the interstate, and everything doubled in price. For example, getting my two televisions mounted on the wall cost $600. When I walked into the apartment, it had not been cleaned between tenants, so I hired cleaners and various other things before I got settled. I leaned heavily on that moving fund and was so glad I had set it aside. When I decided to save money for my move, I sat down and went through all my bills, determining how much I could comfortably save. Then, I took another look to see what I could cut to save even more. I set up an automatic deposit into the savings account for the move directly from my paycheck every two weeks for six months, so there was no second-guessing. Knowing that I was moving to a new city and that I could go to dinners, movies, and hang out with friends there, I cut a lot of that out while I was saving. I focused on the goal, and sometimes, it was hard because we all need a little entertainment at times — but I was determined to make this happen.  By the time everything was said and done, and I was sitting comfortably in my apartment, I had spent $10,000. I made sure my finances were in order. I had a good job with great health benefits. I knew that my credit would be checked, so I pulled my credit report from all three credit bureaus and made sure everything was in good shape. Understand that you are moving to a new city where no one knows you; all you have is money and credit to get you where you need to go. I have always known that credit is so important, and I write about it from firsthand experience. I knew that to get an apartment in NYC, I would have to have good credit. I already had a positive payment history because I always pay my bills on time, but there were a couple of steps I took to make sure my credit looked great: With all this in place, I was ready to start my life in New York. I consider this to be such a great milestone in my life because I was able to make a dream of mine come true, and it was good financial habits that made it possible. Now I navigate New York City as if I've lived here all my life.  Jump to"
