During a temporary ceasefire mediated by Qatar and Egypt last November, Hamas released 105 hostages and Israel released 240 Palestinian prisoners.\n     \n            ‚ÄúThe Qataris have concluded that there is insufficient willingness from either side, with the mediation efforts becoming more about politics and PR rather than a serious attempt to secure peace, save the hostages and Palestinian civilians,‚Äù the diplomatic source told CNN. ‚ÄúAs a consequence, the Hamas political office no longer serves its purpose.‚Äù\n     \n            A separate diplomatic source told CNN that Hamas‚Äô political office in Doha ‚Äú‚Å†won‚Äôt be operational so (Hamas) may leave. The office could open again if talks restart.‚Äù\n     \n            Hamas has insisted that any agreement with Israel must lead to a permanent end to the war in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused that demand. In July he effectively spiked a draft hostage and ceasefire deal by introducing a raft of new, 11th-hour demands.\n     \n            There are 101 hostages still held in Gaza. Israel‚Äôs military campaign, launched in response to Hamas‚Äô October 7 attack, has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health; the UN reported that 70% of the fatalities in the first six months of the conflict were women and children.\n     \n            The Israeli minister of economy, Nir Barkat, appeared to offer the first official Israeli reaction to the move, saying on X that ‚ÄúQatar was never a mediator, but Hamas‚Äô defender, the one to fund and protect the terrorist organization.‚Äù Netanyahu for years backed payments to Hamas through Qatar, in order to divide Palestinian politics and ‚Äì detractors allege ‚Äì prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n     \n            It is not the first time the Qatari government has expressed frustration ‚Äì particularly with insinuations that it was too close to Hamas. In April, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said that Qatar‚Äôs efforts were being misused for ‚Äúnarrow political interests‚Äù by some involved in the conflict, ‚Äúwhich required the state of Qatar to conduct a comprehensive evaluation‚Äù of its role.\n     \n            The Qatari government has now told the Biden administration that it is willing to restart its mediation efforts ‚Äúwhen both sides reach an impasse and demonstrate a sincere willingness to return to the negotiating table with the objective of putting an end to the war and the suffering of civilians.‚Äù\n     \n            A senior American official told CNN that while Qatar had played ‚Äúan invaluable role in helping to mediate a hostage deal‚Äù last year, ‚Äúfollowing Hamas‚Äô repeated refusal to release even a small number of hostages, including most recently during meetings in Cairo, their continued presence in Doha is no longer viable or acceptable.‚Äù\n     \nAlex Marquardt and MJ Lee contributed to this report.\n     ¬© 2024 Cable News Network.

While sketch comedy show frequently takes aim at Trump — played since 2016 by Alec Baldwin and James Austin Johnson — Saturday's episode spoofed the actors paying fealty to the new commander in chief. The skit started with the actors seeming disturbed. \"The results were shocking and even horrifying,\" Ego Nwodim said.  Trump \"tried to forcibly overturn the results of the last election,\"  Heidi Gardner added. And Kenan Thompson noted that the president-elect \"openly called for vengeance against his political enemies.\" In the next beat, Thompson continued later: \"That is why we at 'SNL' would like to say to you, Donald Trump, we ... have been with you all along.\" \"We have never wavered in our support of you, even when others doubted you,\" Bowen Yang said to laughs from the audience. Marcello Hernández added, \"Every single person on this stage voted for you.\" \"Because we see ourselves in you,\" Nwodim said. \"We look at you and think, 'That's me.'\" \"That's the man I want my future children to look up to,\" said Sarah Sherman. The cast members were quick to throw each other under the bus, so to say. Colin Jost dropped the name of his co-anchor on the \"Weekend Update\" satirical news segment. \"Mr. Trump, your honor,\" he said, \"we know that you say things that are controversial sometimes, but really you're just speaking the truth. And I hate how the lamestream media, Michael Che, tries to spin it to make you look foolish.\" Sherman described the show's latest talents — Ashley Padilla, Emil Wakim, and Jane Wickline — as supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost the presidential race to Trump. She called them \"three disgusting new cast members.\" Johnson — whose past reflections of the former president included meandering speeches about windmills and television shows — this time appeared in a muscle suit. \"That's right, it's me: hot, jacked Trump,\" he said. \"They finally got the body right.\" Johnson was nothing but supportive, saying, \"He's going to make an incredible president and eventually king.\" Trump supporter and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, played by former cast member Dana Carvey, made an appearance by jumping up and down onstage, where he touted SpaceX rockets as “super cool.” “Check it out, Dark MAGA — yeah,” he said. “But seriously, I run the country now.” The cast addressed what many pundits have said was the key demographic in the 2024 presidential election: young men who feel unseen. \"We say to you, young men, there's no need to feel down,\" Yang said, starting a sing-along to the introductory lines of one of Trump's favorite songs, the Village People's \"YMCA.\" Comedian and host Bill Burr also addressed the election, telling women, \"You're 0 and 2 against this guy,\" and suggesting women running for the highest office avoid pantsuits. Burr said the highlight of campaign season was Trump's visit to a McDonald's, where he watched french fries being made and served people at a drive-thru window. The comedian said it was the only time he had seen Trump truly happy, \"glowing,\" even, as he stuffed a few extra fries into someone's order. \"Oh, my God,\" he said. \"Was that empathy?\" “Saturday Night Live” and NBC News share a parent company, NBCUniversal. News segment \"Weekend Update\" addressed Trump's win with the show's more typically acerbic humor. \"On Tuesday, we learned that Democrats don't actually know how to rig an election,\" Jost said. He expressed faith in the Democratic Party's ability to learn from the loss. \"I know Democrats are going to take a long look in the mirror, learn from their mistakes, and then run Biden again in 2028,\" he said. The show's musical guest was Mk.gee. “SNL” airs on NBC, a division of NBCUniversal, which is also the parent company of NBC News.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)     ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — Opponents of offshore wind energy projects expect President-elect Donald Trump to kill an industry he has vowed to end on the first day he returns to the White House. But it might not be that easy. Many of the largest offshore wind companies put a brave face on the election results, pledging to work with Trump and Congress to build power projects and ignoring the incoming president’s oft-stated hostility to them. In campaign appearances, Trump railed against offshore wind and promised to sign an executive order to block such projects. “We are going to make sure that that ends on Day 1,” Trump said in a May speech. “I’m going to write it out in an executive order. It’s going to end on Day 1.” “They destroy everything, they’re horrible, the most expensive energy there is,” Trump said. “They ruin the environment, they kill the birds, they kill the whales.” Numerous federal and state scientific agencies say there is no evidence linking offshore wind preparation to a spate of whale deaths along the U.S. East Coast in recent years. Turbines have been known to kill shorebirds, but the industry and regulators say there are policies to mitigate harm to the environment. Trump has railed against offshore wind turbines spoiling the view from a golf course he owns in Scotland. But numerous environmental groups say the real reason he opposes offshore wind is his support for the fossil fuel industry. \n There is almost 65 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity under development in the U.S., enough to power more than 26 million homes, and some turbines are already spinning in several states, according to the American Clean Power Association. Currently operating projects include the Block Island Wind Farm in Rhode Island, the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind pilot project and the South Fork Wind Farm about 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Montauk Point on New York’s Long Island. Trump is unlikely to end those projects but might have more leverage over ones still in the planning stage, those in the debate say. Bob Stern, who headed an office in the U.S. Energy Department responsible for environmental protection during the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations, said Trump can get Congress to reduce or eliminate tax credits for offshore wind that were granted in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. Those credits are an integral part of the finances of many offshore wind projects. Stern, who leads the New Jersey anti-offshore wind group Save LBI, said Trump also could issue executive orders prohibiting further offshore leases and rescinding approval for ones already approved while pushing Congress to amend federal laws granting more protection for marine mammals. The president-elect also can appoint leaders of agencies involved in offshore wind regulation who would be hostile to it or less supportive. Opponents of offshore wind, many of them Republicans, were giddy following the election, saying they fully expect Trump to put an end to the industry. “I believe this is a tipping point for the offshore wind industry in America,” said Robin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast NJ, one of the most vocal groups opposing offshore wind on the East Coast. “They have been given a glidepath by Democrat-run administrations at the federal and state level for many years. For this industry, (Tuesday’s) results will bring headwinds far greater than they have faced previously.” But Tina Zappile, director of the Hughes Center for Public Policy at New Jersey’s Stockton University, noted that in 2018, Trump Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke voiced strong support for offshore wind. And even though the president-elect has bashed the technology, she predicted he won’t just make it go away. “Offshore wind might appear to be on the chopping block — Trump’s explicitly said this was something he’d fix on the first day — but when the economics of offshore wind are in alignment with his overall strategies of returning manufacturing to America and becoming energy-independent, his administration is likely to back away slowly from this claim,” she said in an interview. “Offshore wind may be temporarily hampered, but its long-term prospects in the U.S. are unlikely to be hurt.” Commercial fishermen in Maine said they hope the Trump administration will undo policies designed to help build and approve offshore wind projects, saying regulators attempted to “future-proof” the industry against political change. Jerry Leeman, CEO of the New England Fishermen’s Stewardship Association, called on Trump to reverse a commitment to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. The offshore wind industry is taking an optimistic stance, pledging to work with Trump his political allies. National and New Jersey wind industry groups, and several offshore wind developers including Atlantic Shores and Denmark-based Orsted, issued similarly worded statements highlighting terms likely to appeal to Republicans including job creation, economic development and national security. “By combining the strengths of all domestic energy resources, the Trump administration can advance an economy that is dynamic, secure, and clean,” Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a statement. “We are committed to working with the Trump-Vance administration and the new Congress to continue this great American success story.” But few Republicans were in a welcoming mood following the election. New Jersey Assemblyman Paul Kanitra listed the major offshore wind companies in a Facebook post, saying, “It’s time to pack your bags and get the hell away from the Jersey Shore, our marine life, fishing industry and beautiful beaches.” Kanitra said he was looking forward “to your stock prices tanking.” And that was starting to happen.  The stock prices of European offshore wind companies, many of which are planning or building projects on the U.S. East Coast, plunged amid fears the new administration would seek to slow or end such projects. Orsted closed down nearly 14% on Wednesday and was down 11% over the past five days. Turbine manufacturer Vestas Wind Systems was down nearly 24% over that same period. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican, hosted Trump at a rally earlier this year at which Trump again vowed to kill offshore wind. “We are currently working out the specifics of what that will look like once he takes office again this January,” VanDrew said. “President Trump is a good friend of New Jersey, and he understands the devastating impact these projects will have on our communities.” Follow Wayne Parry on X.

Focus on relationships and artistic activities and trust that the universe will both protect you and guide you – as it surely will. Saturn in the most sensitive area of your chart can make it appear as if everyone is against you but deep down you know that isn’t true. As the planet of troubles comes to the end of its retrograde phase this week you won’t be quite so paranoid. Stop trying to control each and every little thing that occurs and let fate take its course. In the short term there will inevitably be setbacks and upheavals but over a longer period of time everything will ultimately come good. You don’t have to struggle. As an air sign you tend to live more in the head than the heart but someone has got under your skin to such an extent of late that your thinking has got a bit skewed. It’s time to start seeing them for who and what they truly are. Try not to be so distrustful of the people you deal with. As Venus moves into the partnership area of your chart this week you can take it as read that even colleagues you don’t know very well mean you no harm. Treat everyone as a friend. Keep routine tasks to a minimum over the next few days and resist other people’s attempts to persuade you to take on more commitments. You are doing more than your fair share as it is and are under no obligation to break your back for their benefit. There is no point making a big noise about matters that are of little importance now and will be of no importance at all come the end of the week. Bear in mind that nothing in life stays the same for long and that everything improves over time. The more open you are to alternative viewpoints the less inclined you will be to get angry about what’s going on in the world. Take a step back from the daily news cycle and invite your mind to show you the bigger picture. Yes, there really is one. The message of the stars this week is that you need to give up trying to resist what you know cannot be stopped. There is such a thing as fate and if you can attune yourself to its workings you will be happier on every possible level. Are you living up to your highest ideals or are you following an easier path that other people have mapped out for you? If it’s the latter you must now change your thinking and start moving toward a loftier goal. You were born to be great. As Venus moves into your sign this week you will find yourself worrying less about issues that previously were on your mind every minute of every day. What is the meaning of life? It is to love who you are, love what you do and love other people. All the tensions that have been building up in recent months will be released over the coming week, making it easier to let go of the past and open up a new path through life. What you thought was so important yesterday will mean nothing to you tomorrow. Because you are such a sensitive person you can usually tell when a loved one needs a kind word or a helping hand and they will need both over the next few days. Put your own plans on hold and do what you can to ease their pain.

            "content": "The No. 24 Missouri Tigers beat the Oklahoma Sooners 30-23 on Saturday night to move to 7-2 on the season and 3-2 in SEC play. But it's how the Tigers earned their seventh win of the season that's noteworthy. The ending of this college football game was absolutely wild. Missouri led the game 16-9 after quarterback Drew Pyne hit tight end Brett Norfleet on a five-yard touchdown strike with 8:47 to play in the contest. Oklahoma answered with 3:18 to play to tie the game at 16 on a trick play that resulted in quarterback Jackson Arnold catching a touchdown pass. With the game tied at 16, the real fun began. Missouri running back Jamal Roberts took a handoff and was stacked up at the line of scrimmage. He lost the football and it went spinning onto the turf without any other Missouri players realizing that there was a loose ball. Oklahoma senior defensive back Billy Bowman Jr. picked up the loose ball and returned it 43 yards to give the Sooners the lead. OH MY GOD, SOONERSpic.twitter.com/1jx8r31RJR On the ensuing possession, now trailing 23-16, Missouri quarterback Drew Pyne led the offense on an eight-play, 75-yard touchdown drive that took just 57 seconds. It culminated in a Pyne touchdown pass to wide receiver Theo Wease Jr. After the extra point, Oklahoma went back to work on the ensuing possession, attempting to get into field goal range with the game tied at 23. On the second play of the drive, Sooners quarterback Jackson Arnold was sacked and lost the football. Missouri defensive end Zion Young picked up the loose ball with 22 seconds to play and ran it into the end zone for what ended up being the game-winning score. CHOKELAHOMA pic.twitter.com/Qmq3EGOYfr For those keeping score at home, that's four total touchdowns, including two defensive scores, in the final 3:18 of regulation. What a sprint. Congrats to the Tigers. As for the Sooners, what an awful way to lose. feed Mike McDaniel is a staff writer on the Breaking and Trending News team at Sports Illustrated, where he has worked since January 2022.

Nikki Haley, a Republican who ran against President-elect Trump months ago, responded after he publicly announced that she would not be joining his administration. Responding in an equally public format, Haley wrote that she wishes him \"great success.\" \"I was proud to work with President Trump defending America at the United Nations,\" she wrote in a X post Saturday.  \"I wish him, and all who serve, great success in moving us forward to a stronger, safer America over the next four years,\" she said.

(Justin Sullivan/Win McNamee) Haley's gracious response came after Trump took to Truth Social to frankly state that U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, as well as former Secretary of State and CIA Director Mike Pompeo would not be participating in his new cabinet.  The announcement came after rumors have swirled regarding President-elect Trump's cabinet members. NIKKI HALEY PENS SUPPORTIVE OP-ED IN FAVOR OF TRUMP AHEAD OF ELECTION DAY: ‘EASY CALL’ \"I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley, or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to join the Trump Administration, which is currently in formation,\" the president-elect posted on Truth Social early Saturday evening.  \"I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our Country,\" he continued. \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" Nikki Haley, former governor of South Carolina, during a news conference in Sderot, Israel, on Monday, May 27, 2024.

Ranger Brandon Bess: The thing that really got me about the case was, you don't expect to have this beautiful, young, single, schoolteacher be murdered in her own home …. She was such a great person, came from such a great family. Ranger Brandon Bess: It was an unusual crime scene. She's over the bathtub and she's obviously been sexually assaulted and handcuffed behind her back. Natalie Morales | \"48 Hours\" contributor: Were they … police-grade handcuffs? Ranger Brandon Bess: Yeah. … Handcuffs have always been a key piece of this. Jan. 14, 1995. It was a Saturday. Catherine, as most people called her, didn't show up for a family lunch and she wasn't answering her phone. When her mother and father went to check on her, they had to see what no parent ever should.   911 OPERATOR: What happened ma'am? MARY ANN EDWARDS: We came over here and found her. … Please send someone over – 911 OPERATOR: OK, we're sending someone ma'am. Is she — was she shot or what? MARY ANN EDWARDS: Ah … we can't tell. Catherine was 31.  Dianna Coe remembers hearing the news. The sisters, both schoolteachers, looked so much alike everyone had trouble telling them apart — especially their young students.  Heleniah Adams: Ms. Edwards … was my second-grade teacher. Heleniah Adams remembers being in her classroom.  Heleniah Adams: Most of us grew up in … a pretty tough environment. … And being around Ms. Edwards was a joy. Det. Aaron Lewallen: Originally, they believed that she might've been drowned, but there wasn't enough fluid in her lungs, so then it kind of became a suffocation by compression.   Heleniah Adams: I just remember being told that our teacher wouldn't make it to class that day … Everyone just crying.  Dianna Coe: My mom is the one that told me … And so she said, \"have you not heard about Catherine?\" … and I go, \"my Catherine?\" She had been friends with Catherine and her twin sister Allison since middle school. Dianna Coe: I was new to the area. … so I knew no one. … and they … just started talking to me … asked me my name … and we were friends from that point forward. The sisters, both schoolteachers, looked so much alike everyone had trouble telling them apart — especially their young students. Heleniah Adams: Ms. Edwards … was my second-grade teacher. Heleniah Adams remembers being in her classroom.  Heleniah Adams: Most of us grew up in … a pretty tough environment. … And being around Ms. Edwards was a joy. Det. Aaron Lewallen: Originally, they believed that she might've been drowned, but there wasn't enough fluid in her lungs, so then it kind of became a suffocation by compression.   Heleniah Adams: I just remember being told that our teacher wouldn't make it to class that day … Everyone just crying.  Early investigators could not piece together what happened, but those police-grade handcuffs were a big clue. Det. Aaron Lewallen: It was almost talked about like a ghost story around a campfire. Aaron Lewallen is a detective with the Beaumont Police Department. Det. Aaron Lewallen: Maybe it was somebody in law enforcement or somebody in security. … Could it have been somebody that we knew? In the weeks after the murder, police focused on tracing the serial numbers of the handcuffs but came up empty. They also zeroed in on an old boyfriend — David Perry. Det. Aaron Lewallen: They focused on him early on because … there was no forced entry. But Perry was out of town that night. He gave a DNA sample and it was not a match. David Perry: I wasn't there. It's not me.  The crime scene DNA stayed well preserved and the years dragged on and on  — until forensic science changed. By 2018, there was a way to take the DNA left at a crime scene and search for biological relatives.  A program — Gedmatch — scarfs up all the DNA from people who agree to share it with law enforcement and upload it when they use sites like Ancestry.com and 23andMe. Det. Aaron Lewallen: Ranger Bess approached me … and he asked if I thought we had a case that would fit the bill for that type of investigation. I said, \"absolutely. I know the perfect case for this.\" And it was the Catherine Edwards case. So, in April 2020, the DNA from Catherine Edwards' crime scene went to Othram, a lab outside of Houston, for testing. Det. Aaron Lewallen: There, they would give us familial matches. And from there, we would start trying to build a family tree to get us closer to our suspect.  But the number of names to pursue was overwhelming. Det. Aaron Lewallen: When the family tree began to grow beyond my computer screen, (laughs) I started to get a little bit confused. And that's when … Tina jumped on board. Det. Aaron's Lewallen's wife, Tina Lewallen, an auto crimes detective, began using her off hours to help sort through it. Det. Tina Lewallen: The matches were all Cajun. Natalie Morales: Cajun … ancestry – Det. Tina Lewallen: Yes. Natalie Morales: — coming from the Louisiana area. Det. Tina Lewallen: Yes. Natalie Morales: Specifically. Det. Tina Lewallen: … particularly Kaplan, Louisiana. So Det. Tina Lewallen went back to Catherine's journals looking for clues.  Det. Tina Lewallen: … to see if I could see a Cajun name that jumped out to me. … I did find a few French names and they were quickly eliminated and nowhere in our tree. And as she was building out the branches, one of the names on the family tree kept coming up: LaPoint. Det. Tina Lewallen: I'm researching the matches and building my trees and you're researching other people's trees … I kept noticing Shera LaPoint — had built that tree, and then I'm working some more, I do some more research. Well, Shera LaPoint built this tree. And I'm like, is she related to our suspect? … I had no idea who she was. And when they called her, they found out LaPoint had been building her family tree. Shera LaPoint: It was my family's DNA kits that I had uploaded to GEDmatch. And then they found out something that changed the course of the investigation. LaPoint was known professionally as \"The Gene Hunter\" and already skilled at working these cases.  She'd identified one of the women buried along Interstate Highway 45 in the Texas killing fields case.   And she agreed to lend her expertise.  Shera LaPoint: I told him that I was willing to help. Even if it meant taking a hard look at her own relatives. Shera LaPoint: It was kind of scary because I'm putting my own second cousins in this tree and I'm thinking, oh my gosh, you know, could one of my grandfather's sister's grandchildren have — have done this, they lived here in Texas. It was a complicated, multilayered process using publicly available DNA, birth and death records — finding parents, siblings and cousins. Shera LaPoint: As you build those trees, you look for information that … is pertinent to the case that you're working on. We had a tag for people who were in Beaumont … She was a teacher. As you build tree, you look at people who are in education. The tree grew up and down and sideways – there were almost 7,500 names. Shera LaPoint: That's a lot of hours, a lot of work and a lot of people in a family tree.  All the while, Det. Tina Lewallen hardly slept, working through most nights — knowing there was a killer still out there. Det. Tina Lewallen: Every day counted; every day mattered … I needed to get it solved. Hunkered down at their computers day after day, constantly back and forth on the phone, Det. Tina Lewallen and genealogist Shera LaPoint are quickly becoming great partners. Det. Tina Lewallen: She was a team player from jump. Never had met me. … we talked so often that we became friends. Natalie Morales: Best buds. Shera LaPoint: Best buds. I don't know what else to say. And when they needed DNA, they turned to Det. Tina Lewallen's husband, Det. Aaron Lewallen, and Texas Ranger Brandon Bess. Det. Aaron Lewallen: So, from that point, me and Brandon Bess would drive around Texas and go talk to these people. Ranger Brandon Bess: Convincing someone … to give their DNA up, to give a piece of themselves up to you in a homicide investigation can be very difficult. Ranger Brandon Bess: When we would sense, um, anxiety in someone, Aaron would immediately tell them, \"hey, who do you want to play you in the movie ...\" Ranger Brandon Bess: And they would look at Aaron like he was crazy … and say, (laughs) um, \"what are you talking about.\" \"Well, this guy's a Texas Ranger, everything they do turns into a movie. Who do you want to play your role in this movie?\" (laughs) That calmed them down every time … and I of course threw out there, \"hey, I've already got Brad Pitt. So, you know, you can't — you can't be Brad – cause Brad's playing me.\" Natalie Morales: Was there ever a time though that somebody actually thought … my uncle may actually be a killer. Who knows? Ranger Brandon Bess: In every one of these cases that I've worked using DNA and genetic genealogy, you have at least one person, usually two or three that says, you know what, I had that weird Uncle Joe … Once the uploads were compared to the killer's DNA, if the amount of shared genetic material was low, they knew it was a dead end. Det. Aaron Lewallen: Cause there were times when we would come across a name and I'm like — you get that that butterflies in your stomach …  like, \"hey, maybe this is our guy\" … And then … turns out it's not our guy. After almost three month of ups and down and nearly nonstop work, LaPoint hit paydirt.  Shera LaPoint: It was about 10:30 at night. She was working a family line very distantly related to her own. Shera LaPoint: It was a very common Cajun name, Thibodeaux. … I got to a couple who were in Beaumont … I was able to see from, uh, records that they had two sons. This was a major lead: a family, in Catherine's town, with two sons who went to Forest Park High – the same school Catherine did — at around the same time. Shera LaPoint: I put the names in the tree and I messaged Tina and I said, um, \"there's a couple in Beaumont.\" Shera LaPoint: I'm tired, I'm going to bed. And I turned my cellphone off and I fell asleep on the sofa … and when I woke up the next morning, my phone had just blown up. Natalie Morales: And it was you on the other end? Det. Tina Lewallen: Yes. Natalie Morales: What were you saying? Det. Tina Lewallen: This is them. We found them. Just didn't know which one. Natalie Morales: OK … it's either Michael Foreman or Clayton Foreman. What did you do to — to figure that out? Det. Aaron Lewallen: The first name I ran was Clayton … And when I came across his prior conviction for the sexual assault, the hair on the back of my neck stood up. I'm like, \"this is our guy.\" In 1981, a 19-year-old woman told police that Clayton Foreman bound her hands and raped her.  She had also gone to Forest Park High School where Clayton was the manager of the football team. Clayton Foreman was convicted but was given probation and paid a fine. Natalie Morales: But he did not have to give a DNA sample at that time. Det. Aaron Lewallen: No. This was back in the early '80s. We didn't have sex offender registry, uh, no DNA database. And then they found another connection: it went all way back to Dianna Coe, Catherine's friend from middle school.  In high school, Coe fell madly in love. Her boyfriend had graduated three years ahead of her, and they got engaged. Dianna Coe: He was so kind. … He had the most wonderful personality. And when she started planning her wedding, she immediately turned to her old friends Catherine and Allison. Dianna Coe: And they were one of the first ones I thought of as, uh, bridesmaid and — and I asked them and they said yes. And the groom? The man Coe married back in 1982? Now he was their number one suspect: Clayton Foreman. Natalie Morales: She in fact did know him. Det. Aaron Lewallen: Yes. In hindsight, there were signs. When Coe found out about Clayton Foreman's legal troubles, the wedding was less than three months away. Dianna Coe: … and … the wedding invitations had already been mailed out. Dianna Coe: And I said, \"rape?\" I said, \"oh, there's no way.\" But she never got any details and her fiancé explained it away. Dianna Coe: … he kept telling me, it — it was a big misunderstanding … And so in my mind, I thought, well, he must be telling the truth because if he got arrested, he's not in jail. Natalie Morales: But you didn't really believe it was rape? Dianna Coe: Right. Coe's sister, Anne Anderson, and her brother, Scooter Daleo, were not so sure and neither were their parents who wanted her to call it off. Scooter Daleo: And I said, well, \"Dianna, why don't you just wait?\" … And she didn't wanna wait. She wanted to marry Clay. She was in love with him. Anne Anderson: … she's believing him and she's wanting to get married, then — then we have to support as a family. Dianna Coe: And he was like, I'm so, so sorry. … I love you. I want us to be married. I want us to have a family. … And so, I was like, OK, you know. So I went — I went through with it. Dianna and Clayton Foreman stayed married for a little more than 11 years and they had a son. The relationship began to fray over Foreman lying about their finances and it ended after he had an affair. And looking back, Coe can see that he had an unhealthy fascination with police officers and the tools of their trade — like handcuffs. Dianna Coe: I remember that he had ordered those handcuffs. … Well, he had 'em hung over the rearview mirror … And I — I didn't think anything of it. When Catherine was killed, they were divorced, but Coe remembers calling her ex-husband to talk about it. Dianna Coe: I think I was, you know, crying and I said, \"oh, my God,\" I said, \"somebody has murdered Catherine.\" And — and he goes,\" oh, really?\" Just like no emotion … When we hung the phone up, I can remember 'cause I was like kind of squinting and kind of like going, God, that's kind of odd. With all the mounting evidence, Foreman needed to be found. He was 60 and no longer living in Beaumont. They quickly tracked him to Reynoldsberg, Ohio. Natalie Morales: What was he doing there? Det. Aaron Lewallen: He was an Uber driver at the time. … I was able to send a lead, uh, to a field office up there … and basically did what we call a trash run. Natalie Morales: You need to collect a piece of DNA so that you can ensure that it's the — the right guy, right? Det. Aaron Lewallen: Correct. Uh, so, that's what they did. … They surveilled his house … and then went and snatched a bag of trash … and sent it to me. Det. Aaron Lewallen: Uh, so, I brought that stuff to Houston, to the DPS crime lab. And from there they tested it. The likelihood that the DNA belonged to Clayton Foreman was a big number — 461 septillion. It doesn't get better than that, says LaPoint. Shera LaPoint: I mean, you can't fight those odds. You cannot fight those odds. And that was all they needed. Det. Aaron Lewallen: And I got a text from a — a DPS lab technician. And she said, \"go get his ass.\" Det. Aaron Lewallen and Ranger Bess were about to hop a plane to Ohio, ready to face the man they felt sure had killed Catherine. And while they're doing that, Det. Tina Lewallen pays a visit to Coe. Natalie Morales: Did they tell you we had — they had DNA, though? Tina told you that? Dianna Coe: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Dianna Coe: And I just went (gasps) \"Oh my God, please don't tell me it was Clay –\" Dianna Coe: I almost fell to the ground. … I was just like, \"oh, my God.\" Like, \"oh, God, I can't believe he's done this.\" When Ranger Bess and Det. Aaron Lewallen arrive at the Franklin County Sheriff's Office to confront Clayton Foreman, they have a cover story – it's about a lost item from one of Foreman's Uber rides. Ranger Brandon Bess: We go in under the — uh, under the ruse of someone had left, uh, a purse in his car. So he came in — voluntarily to talk about a purse that was in the car. It was April 29, 2021 — 26 years after Catherine Edwards was murdered, and they are sure they are sitting in front of the man who murdered her. RANGER BESS (Foreman interview): We're asking you to visit with us about a crime that we're investigating. OK? Natalie Morales: Did he immediately go, uh-oh, you know — Det. Aaron Lewallen: No, he didn't RANGER BESS (Foreman interview): So, the crime that we're looking at is the murder of Mary Catherine Edwards. … and she was murdered in 1995. Natalie Morales: I guess he pretty quickly realized he wasn't there to give up a purse.  Ranger Brandon Bess: He did … RANGER BESS (Foreman interview): And we found a picture of — a wedding picture that she and her sister, uh — DET. AARON LEWALLEN: Allison. RANGER BESS: — Allison were actually in your wedding. CLAYTON FOREMAN: Right. RANGER BESS: And — CLAYTON FOREMAN: 1982. RANGER BESS: — 82. OK. RANGER BESS: Do you ever remember anyone ever coming to you — about that crime? CLAYTON FOREMAN:  No. RANGER BESS: Were you aware of the crime even? CLAYTON FOREMAN: No. RANGER BESS: You didn't know the crime occurred? CLAYTON FOREMAN: No, sir. RANGER BESS: OK. Det. Aaron Lewallen: … we backed him into a bunch of hard corners. He claimed that he didn't even know that she was dead. RANGER BESS (Foreman interview): You didn't know that, um, Catherine Edwards was murdered? CLAYTON FOREMAN: No, sir. Did not. RANGER BESS: Do you remember them from school? Do you remember the girls from school? CLAYTON FOREMAN: Not really. Because they were freshmen. RANGER BESS: When you were a senior? CLAYTON FOREMAN: Yes, sir. RANGER BESS: OK. RANGER BESS (Foreman interview): So, on Mary Edwards, Mary Catherine Edwards. Um, didn't know her well? Did you ever visit with her at all? CLAYTON FOREMAN: No. RANGER BESS: Um, did you ever go in her house at all? Any house that she ever lived in? CLAYTON FOREMAN: No. RANGER BESS: OK.  Det. Aaron Lewallen: You know, \"did you know where she lived?\" No. Had no idea.  Natalie Morales: So, and he's denying, denying … Ranger Brandon Bess: He is denying … you know, in these DNA cases, when you — whether you're gonna get a confession or not, you wanna build up that background of, \"hey, did you know them?\" Number one. RANGER BESS (Foreman interview): Did y'all have much acquaintance with them or was it just like a high school friend thing? RANGER BESS: How did you know them? CLAYTON FOREMAN: I think they were bridesmaids for my — my ex-wife.  RANGER BESS: That's right. RANGER BESS: Did you ever go on a date? CLAYTON FOREMAN: Never dated.  Ranger Brandon Bess: All the way up to, \"did you ever have sex with this person?\" RANGER BESS (Foreman interview): Never obviously had sex with her. CLAYTON FOREMAN: No. RANGER BESS: Never? CLAYTON FOREMAN: Never. Ranger Brandon Bess: Did you go to college together? Did you do all — everything was a no, Det. Aaron Lewallen: And we had those denials several times. And then, so, towards the end of the interview, we asked him, well, if all those things are true, can you explain how your DNA ended up on her and on her bed? RANGER BESS (Foreman questioning): Do you understand DNA? CLAYTON FOREMAN: Mm-hmm. RANGER BESS: And do you understand how DNA works? You understand you're made of DNA? CLAYTON FOREMAN: Right. RANGER BESS (referencing Det. Aaron Lewallen): He's made of DNA. I'm made of DNA. Ranger Brandon Bess: I think that Foreman knew enough about DNA that he thought he would've been caught already. He knew that he had never submitted his DNA — Ranger Brandon Bess: He had no clue that he was going to be arrested that day. RANGER BESS (Foreman interview): Clay, I'mma level with you. Right here and now, I want you to hear me real close. CLAYTON FOREMAN: All right, sir. RANGER BESS: That crime scene was processed really well. … and your DNA was on Catherine's bed and was inside Catherine. CLAYTON FOREMAN: OK. I mean, I don't know how it got there, but, if you say it was there.  RANGER BESS: There's only one way for it to get there.  CLAYTON FOREMAN: OK.  RANGER BESS: Um, and that's by you putting it there. CLAYTON FOREMAN: OK.  RANGER BESS: Do you understand that?  CLAYTON FOREMAN: Uh —  RANGER BESS: Do you understand the implications of that? The day that she died, the night that she died, your DNA is in her and your DNA is on her bedspread. … Now I don't want you to say anything right this second. I want you to think about the next words that come out of your mouth. I want you to think very hard about that. …  OK? RANGER BESS: There's two people that know that story. … You're one of them and she's the other. And she can't talk.  CLAYTON FOREMAN: Mm-hmm.  RANGER BESS: What I ask you is now to be honest with us completely and tell us, you know, how did that happen?  CLAYTON FOREMAN: I'm not going to say anything. I probably need an attorney now, I think.  RANGER BESS: You probably need one or you do need one? CLAYTON FOREMAN: Well, if you're saying I did that, then I'll probably need an attorney to talk to. RANGER BESS: Well, that's all we got then. We're going to let you walk out of that door just like we told you. Ranger Brandon Bess: It's a grainy video, but you can probably see us grinning at each other — that he thinks he's walking outta here, he thinks he's fixing to leave here. Det. Aaron Lewallen: So, as he got out, down the hallway, headed towards the elevator, we stopped him and arrested him for the murder of Catherine Edwards. And after all those years and all that work, Aaron Lewallen and Brandon Bess had one thing left they needed to do. Det. Aaron Lewallen: Uh, if you remember back when we were talking about the crime scene, she was handcuffed. … So, we had talked to the DA's office beforehand and got permission to use those handcuffs. The very handcuffs that bound Catherine the night she died. Natalie Morales: How did it feel to put those handcuffs on him? Ranger Brandon Bess: Very good … it's a moment I'll never forget … you feel like you got to do something for Catherine there .,.. you know, like physically got to do for her, is take those cuffs that bound her when she was murdered and put them back on the guy that murdered her. It's — you know, it may seem small to some, but it was a really big deal to us, and it felt good. Even though they'd had their suspicions about him, when Det. Tina Lewallen broke the news to his ex-wife Dianna Coe that Clayton Foreman was arrested for the murder of Catherine Edwards was still a shock. Scooter Daleo: … she calls me … And she says, \"Clay murdered Catherine.\" And I said, \"do what?\" Anne Anderson: Your brain doesn't — because it — it knows him as a person, as a — as — as somebody that you — you know, your brother-in-law or your brother. Dianna Coe: That was — that was — that was hard. … I thought of Allison … And I just — I — I just couldn't believe it. … my — my thought immediately went to Allison and I just said … \"Allison. … oh, my God, she's gonna hate me.\" But Det. Tina Lewallen assured Coe, on the contrary, that Allison was very concerned for her.  Dianna Coe: And — and she said, she's – \"she's worried for you.\" And she said, \"do not — do not think that.\" On March 12, 2024, nearly 30 years after Mary Catherine Edwards was found dead in her town house,  Beaumont prosecutor Patrick Knauth and his colleagues Mike Laird and Sonny Eckhart are ready for trial. Mike Laird: This is not going to be easy, uh, for a lot of people, cause it's been a long time coming. … you gotta remember this happened in 1995. MIKE LAIRD (in court): You're gonna get to learn a lot about DNA.  And they are extremely confident about their case against Clayton Foreman. JUDGE JOHN STEVENS (in court) : Mr. Burbank, do you wanna make an opening statement at this time? TOM BURBANK: No, your honor. Tom Burbank Is defending Foreman. Patrick Knauth: He didn't really have anything. And he knew it. The prosecution calls Catherine's twin sister Allison. Patrick Knauth: We wanted to remind everyone, this is about Catherine and her family. And that's the way we wanted to start off with ... Here at 60, sitting before them, was the spitting image of what could have been. ALLISON EDWARDS BROCATO (in court): That is a picture of my sister Catherine. Reliving the day she lost Catherine. ALLISON EDWARDS BROCATO (in court): … and then the next thing we know, you know, my mom and dad drove up (crying) and told us what — I mean, they — there were no words. She was dead. That was all that mattered. … I didn't know how, what or anything.  … I didn't know what happened to her, it was just that she was gone was all I knew. The pain and the loss still so palpable. ALLISON EDWARDS BROCATO (in court): Four years later, I had a daughter, and her name is Catherine (crying), Catherine Ann after my sister and she never got to know her. … That's the hardest part … Heleniah Adams, Catherine Edwards' student when she was 7, is now 37 and sat in the courtroom nearly every day. Heleniah Adams: It was times … when they would show photos or when they showed the videos of her on the floor …  it was as if your heart was breaking all over again. Detective Tina Lewallen and genealogist Shera LaPoint, along with other crime lab technicians, walk the jury through the process of the genealogy and the DNA match. Ranger Bess and Det. Aaron Lewallen go through the final stages of the investigation. All carefully coordinated to make the chain of evidence airtight. And on the last day, the prosecution calls all the women who had been scarred by Foreman – and were alive to say so. TOM BURBANK (in court): He was your supervisor?  KRISTY WEIMER: That's correct. An old co-worker. KRISTY WEIMER (in court): Whenever I opened up the drawer, there was a pair of handcuffs. A former fiancée who found pictures of young girls. TERESA BREWER (in court): He said to me that he had them so that he could fantasize about taking their virginity. His ex-wife, Dianna Coe, who agreed to testify. TOM BURBANK (in court): Did you think at the time you were in love with the defendant?  DIANNA COE: Yes. Natalie Morales: When you saw him at trial … How hard was that for you? Dianna Coe: That was very hard … And uh — it was very embarrassing to me and — and I do feel ashamed. And it was during the trial that Coe learned about what really happened to that 19-year-old woman in the months before she and Foreman married. Dianna Coe: … it was the most horrific thing that I could have ever heard. … I couldn't imagine what she went through and was so brave to get up and say what she said. She was the final witness, returning to the night her car got stuck and Foreman — falsely claiming he was a policeman — offered to help. PAULA RAMSEY (in court): First he — he tied my hands back.  MIKE LAIRD: He tied your hands behind your back?  PAULA RAMSEY: Yes. MIKE LAIRD: Did he threaten to cut your throat if you didn't?  PAULA RAMSEY: Yes. MIKE LAIRD: This whole thing took a while, didn't it? PAULA RAMSEY: Yes, sir. I'm sorry. MIKE LAIRD: What happened then?  PAULA RAMSEY: He — he took me home.   MIKE LAIRD: Did he say something that — that you felt was odd?  PAULA RAMSEY: Yes. He said three things. He said, \"stop crying. I'm sorry. I hope I didn't hurt you.\" And there was another women who did not testify but went on the record. An alleged victim of Foreman's violence — also a high school friend of Dianna Coe who did not press changes. She told investigators Foreman attacked her from behind and put a gun to her head. Pat Knauth: She had indicated back in '85 or '86 that he had, uh, come to her apartment and knocked on the door and told her that he was having financial and marital problems with Dianna, and he needed somebody to talk to. And so … she let him in. Prosecutors suspect Foreman used a similar ruse the night he appeared at Catherine Edwards' door. Pat Knauth: That's the way we thought he got to Catherine, 'cause Catherine was very, very Christian, very giving, very naïve … And that's a wonderful thing to be, except when you're faced with Clayton Foreman. Dianna Coe: I've always wondered, did he say something about me? Hey, it's Clay and, you know, I need to talk to you about — something about Dianna. It's always — I've always wondered, but I thought I'll never know. After seven days of prosecution testimony, the defense calls no witnesses, and attorney Burbank closes. TOM BURBANK (in court): You heard different things in reference to sex things and stuff like that, okay, still doesn't make him a murderer. TOM BURBANK (in court): You may not like him cause of what people said, but I submit to you, they have not proven murder beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution wraps up its case. PAT KNAUTH (in court): And it's so easy to believe that evil doesn't exist … It is here in this courtroom here today. PAT KNAUTH (in court): These are things I wish I didn't know exist and I'm sorry I had to talk to you about it, but I didn't bring us here, he did. Now it would be up to a jury to decide Clayton Foreman's future.  Knauth wants them to remember Catherine Edwards didn't have one. PAT KNAUTH (in court): And I do pray that Mike and I and Sonny have done a good job for Catherine, and you. I hope we've done our job.  It takes less than an hour for the jury to come back with a verdict. Clayton Foreman is found guilty and sentenced to life for the murder of Catherine Edwards. Larry Delcambre: It didn't take long 'cause all the evidence was there, … once it got into the DNA …more or less sealed it for him. Larry Delcambre, juror No. 2, says he and his fellow jurors had very little to talk about. Larry Delcambre: He had no defense that it wasn't him … there's no denial there. Heleniah Adams: It felt like, hey, this thing does work.  For Heleniah Adams – finally some justice for a favorite teacher after all.  Heleniah Adams: I wanted to close that door, finally. She meant so much to me. Natalie Morales: And when you heard those words guilty, what was that like for you?  Det. Aaron Lewallen: We did it.  Natalie Morales: Was it — was it an emotional, we did it? Det. Tina Lewallen: This whole case was emotional.  For detectives Tina and Aaron Lewallen, genealogist Shera LaPoint and Ranger Brandon Bess, it was the ending they'd all worked for, but it left lots of room for reflection.  Shera LaPoint: And I think the justice system has worked and he's where he needs to be. … But to say that that's honestly justice for Mary Catherine, it's frustrating to know that he lived a life … and she should have been able to — to live a life and have children and go on. That is frustrating. Det. Tina Lewallen: I never used the word closure. I never used the word justice.  There's no justice. He got to live 26 years that he got to get married. He got to have kids. She did not. There's no justice.  Ranger Brandon Bess : I don't — I don't believe there is such a thing as closure. … Not on this earth. Bess always wanted a confession, they all wanted to know why.  Ranger Brandon Bess: 70% of the time you're not gonna get that and — and 100% of the time you're not gonna get the whole story anyway. Det. Tina Lewallen: We all wanted those answers and because he was spineless and didn't talk to us or give us any information, we'll never know the details behind it. And everyone was still reeling, asking themselves how it was that Clayton Foreman walked among them and no one saw his monstrous core — all those years hiding in plain sight. Det. Tina Lewallen: So, when we identified him, I actually have mutual friends with him that were in shock. … They could not believe it was him because they knew he was such a nice guy. He had fooled so many people for so long. Det. Aaron Lewallen: I personally believe that there are more victims out there. We just hadn't found them yet. Dianna Coe: I find it hard to believe that he has not … assaulted other people. I — I really feel with — all my — with all of my being, I feel that there are others. Scooter Daleo: I believe that. Anne Anderson: I believe it ,too. Natalie Morales: And how do you think he was able to conceal this darker side? Anne Anderson: That's the part I cannot — I can't — figure that out. Dianna Coe: I can't — Uh, I — I don't understand it. I don't know how he could. Like I always say, it's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Larry Delcambre: I have my own speculations. I think somebody — I think some people are demon-possessed or — or demon-influenced, cause that's pure evil. There's nothing else you can explain. That's just evil. Dianna Coe: I was married to a monster is what I was married to and didn't know it.  Anne Anderson: And didn't know it.  Dianna Coe: I think if he would — if he wouldn't have married me, she'd still be alive. But in the wake of the trial, it was time to turn away from Foreman and remember Catherine Edwards as she was and in her own words.  Det. Tina Lewallen: Wow, I didn't realize the timing on this one. December the 11th 1994. She was murdered a month later. (Reading from Catherine's journal): \"I have given my life to God and I will follow his path for me. That gives me a feeling of great relief and peace.  Det. Tina Lewallen (reading from Catherine's journal): \"The human spirit is stronger than anything that can happen to it.\" The vibrant beloved schoolteacher in her prime, gone far too soon. Natalie Morales: If you could talk directly with Mary Catherine Edwards, what would you wish to tell her? Shera LaPoint: Oh my gosh. (crying) Um, I think I would say I love her and I'm sorry. I'm so sorry this happened to her. … And, um, I was honored to be given the privilege to help give answers, very honored, very honored. She was a very special person. She really was. Heleniah Adams: Unfortunately, it introduced me to real loss — to  trauma, to fear, to grief, to heartbreak. To all the feelings. Heleniah Adams: A podcast I watched, they — they would always ask aspiring lawyers, \"when did you fall in love with law?\" And I think that's when I fell in love with law, in the second grade, when Clayton Foreman took my light from me.  Adams is a student once again. She is studying for her master's in criminal justice and plans to apply to law school — a tribute to her teacher. Clayton Foreman is eligible for parole in 2061. By then, he will be 101 years old. Produced by Mary Murphy. Jenna Jackson is the development producer. Doreen Schechter is the producer-editor. Shaheen Tokhi is the field producer.

            "content": "\n\n      Stephen Thompson\n    \n \n                Sabrina Carpenter, seen here at Coachella earlier this year, is nominated in each of the big four categories at the 2025 Grammy Awards: album, song and record of the year, plus best new artist.\n                \n                    \n                    Frazer Harrison/Getty Images North America\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n The pop music landscape has been awash in superstar juggernauts (Taylor Swift, Beyoncé), headline-grabbing beefs (Drake vs. Kendrick Lamar, et. al.) and a freshly minted gaggle of hit-makers such as Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Charli XCX and Shaboozey. Appropriately enough, each of the aforementioned artists — except Drake, who stopped submitting his music for Grammy consideration a while back — received loads of nominations when next year’s Grammy Awards contenders were announced Friday. That isn’t to say that everything played out exactly as expected. And there are plenty of subplots and storylines to unpack as we await the Grammys telecast on Feb. 2, 2025: 1. It’s been a massive year for women in pop. Remember back in 2018, when Neil Portnow, then head of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, said that women needed to “step up” after that year’s Grammys were overwhelmingly won by men? Yeah, he sucked. This year, women dominate the major categories: In record of the year, song of the year and album of the year, six of the eight nominees are headlined by women, though several share billing with male counterparts. And, while the best new artist field is split 50-50, the overwhelming frontrunners (Roan and Carpenter) are both women. 2. As expected, Beyoncé leads the field. The two most heavily nominated musicians of all time share a household: Until Friday, Beyoncé and Jay-Z were tied with 88 nominations apiece, while Beyoncé holds the all-time record for Grammy wins with 32. Now, Queen Bey has a stunning 99 nominations to her name, as Cowboy Carter and an assortment of its songs have racked up a field-leading 11 nods. It helps that Cowboy Carter sprawls across multiple genres and brings in loads of collaborators, which made her eligible in more categories than, say, Chappell Roan, who lacks eligible collaborations and didn’t submit in any genres outside pop. 3. Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter join a select group. The Grammys have four general, cross-genre categories, which have collectively come to be known as The Big Four: album of the year, record of the year, song of the year and best new artist. In the history of the awards, only 13 artists have been nominated in all four categories during the same year — most recently Olivia Rodrigo three years ago. (FINNEAS kinda did it that year, too, but it didn’t count; he was nominated for best new artist as a solo act, but his other nominations in that year’s Big Four were headlined by his sister, Billie Eilish.) In the latest round of nominations, Roan and Carpenter are up for each of The Big Four; if either happens to sweep, she’ll become only the third artist ever to do so, after Christopher Cross in 1981 and Eilish in 2020. 4. Wait, Sabrina Carpenter — whose Short n’ Sweet is her sixth album — is up for best new artist? Yeah, the category of best new artist could really use a rebrand, perhaps to something like “best breakthrough artist,” because newness is very much in the eye of the beholder here. But Carpenter broke through in a big way in 2024, so she was eligible. (The rules are more byzantine than that, but that’s the gist of it.) Same goes for her fellow nominee Khruangbin, which has been cranking out albums since 2015, but fairly recently became popular enough to fill stadiums. 5. Speaking of confusing categories… Grammy viewers have long been baffled by the difference between record and song of the year. As it turns out, so are Grammy voters, who heard Shaboozey’s chart-topping “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” and nominated it for song of the year, but not record of the year. Song of the year is an award for composition, while record of the year is an award for the complete package: the production, the performance, the vibe. “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” is terrific; it’s great fun. But it’s more of a “record of the year” kind of song than a “song of the year” kind of song. 6. The record of the year field does include one very old song. “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” famously interpolates J-Kwon’s 2004 hit “Tipsy,” but the Recording Academy went even further back for the awards’ premier category. John Lennon wrote and recorded his demo of The Beatles’ “Now and Then” sometime around 1977, but the song wasn’t finished or released until late 2023. Naturally, it came out with a huge surge of fanfare, though it’s more curiosity than classic; still, it’s one of eight songs nominated for record of the year in 2025. If it wins, it’ll be the first time a Beatles song won a Grammy since all the way back in… February 2024, when a remastered reissue of 1966’s “I’m Only Sleeping” won best music video. 7. The album of the year field features two extreme dark horses. Six of the eight nominees for album of the year were pretty much mortal locks: Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter, Sabrina Carpenter’s Short n’ Sweet, Charli xcx’s Brat, Billie Eilish’s HIT ME HARD AND SOFT, Chappell Roan’s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess and Taylor Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department. Those six albums dominated 2024 — not only based on sales and streaming, but also in terms of their overall cultural footprint. The next two? Not so much. One is Jacob Collier’s Djesse Vol. 4, which marks Collier’s first album of the year nomination since the one he got for, um, Djesse Vol. 3. With credit to NPR Music editor Jacob Ganz, who referred to this nomination as “filling the Jon Batiste jazz-but-with-smiling spot,” the nod to Collier feels strange coming from such a crowded field of powerhouse contenders. Still, it’s not as unexpected as the nomination for André 3000’s New Blue Sun — which is, remember, an epic-length collection of flute-forward instrumental odysseys. OutKast was a Grammy staple, sure, and lots of people were curious about André’s first record in 17 years. But… album of the year? Really? 8. Of course, there were snubs. Getting left out of a field of five, six or eight nominees isn’t technically a “snub” — it’s just math, really — but there were still surprises among this year’s Grammy omissions. Dua Lipa’s Radical Optimism didn’t perform as well as its predecessor, and the field of women in pop was unusually crowded and strong this year, but her lack of nominations feels notable. (See also: Ariana Grande, who did pick up three nominations but was shut out of The Big Four.) Fans might be surprised to see Zach Bryan absent from the field, given how well his records performed in 2024, but he refused to submit any of his music for consideration, so he’s out. The biggest surprise of all may be Vampire Weekend, whose Only God Was Above Us was considered a lock to be nominated in several categories — possibly even album of the year — but got left out of all of them. 9. Speaking of which, Ye’s Grammy star may finally be fading. The artist formerly known as Kanye West has been nominated for 75 Grammys, and won 24 of them. Even a long string of controversies failed to dampen the Grammys’ enthusiasm for him, given that Donda was nominated for album of the year just three years ago. But Ye’s latest album, the Ty Dolla $ign collaboration Vultures 2, yielded just one nomination, for best rap song (“Carnival”). Ye is either matched or exceeded by an impressive assortment of women, as this year’s rap categories include nominations for Cardi B, Doechii, GloRilla, Beyoncé (joined by Linda Martell), Latto and Rapsody (with Erykah Badu). 10. Never, ever overlook Taylor Swift. Wait, did you just read 12 paragraphs and only one of them mentioned Taylor Swift? Is that even legal? Really, how dare you? Swift picked up six more nominations this year, bringing her total to 58 overall, with 24 wins — including four album of the year gramophones. She’s picked up her seventh nomination for album of the year (for The Tortured Poets Department), is in the running for song and record of the year (for “Fortnight”) and… hey, where are you going?

FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell called the employee’s action “reprehensible,” and said the matter had been referred to the Office of Special Counsel. “This is a clear violation of FEMA’s core values & principles to help people regardless of their political affiliation,” Criswell said in a statement on Saturday. The agency did not identify the employee or say when or where their actions happened. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said it happened in Florida. The Republican governor on Saturday reshared a post from The Daily Wire, a conservative news and opinion website that first reported the news of the firing on Friday, before FEMA issued its statement. DeSantis said the federal worker’s behavior was \"targeted discrimination\" of Florida residents who support Trump and that he’s directed the Florida Division of Emergency Management to investigate the matter. \"The blatant weaponization of government by partisan activists in the federal bureaucracy is yet another reason why the Biden-Harris administration is in its final days,\" DeSantis said. FEMA workers have been in the state helping residents recover from Hurricane Milton last month and, before that, Hurricane Helene. The news comes a month after the agency beat back falsehoods about its disaster response funding. Criswell also told NPR last month that \"disaster response is non-political. It is all about the people.\" “We take our mission to help everyone before, during and after disasters seriously. I will continue to do everything I can to make sure this never happens again,” Criswell said in Saturday’s statement. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor"

(AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File) Follow AP’s coverage of the election and what happens next. SEATTLE (AP) — First-term Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez won reelection Saturday in southwestern Washington state’s closely watched 3rd Congressional District, surviving a rematch with Republican Joe Kent.  Two years ago, Gluesenkamp Perez, who owns an auto-repair shop with her husband, came out of nowhere to win the seat, which hadn’t been in Democratic hands for over a decade. She beat the Trump-endorsed Kent by fewer than 3,000 votes out of nearly 320,000 cast, making it one of the closest races in the country and setting the stage for a tough election fight this year.  Her predecessor, Republican Jaime Herrera Beutler, held office for six terms but failed to survive the 2022 primary after voting to impeach Trump over the Jan. 6 insurrection. The district narrowly went for Trump in 2020, making it a crucial target for both parties this year. The race gained additional attention last week when an arson attack struck a ballot box in Vancouver — the district’s biggest city — scorching hundreds of ballots. People who cast their votes in that box were urged to contact the county auditor’s office to receive replacement ballots. Gluesenkamp Perez has balanced progressive policies with some measures popular with Republicans during her tenure, including securing the U.S.-Mexico border — something she criticizes Biden for failing to do — and introducing a constitutional amendment to force presidents to balance the budget. \n She supports abortion access and has hammered Kent, who previously has said he supported a national abortion ban, for changing his position after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Kent now says abortion laws should be left up to the states.  Gluesenkamp Perez supports policies to counter climate change, but also speaks openly about being a gun owner. A top priority is pushing a “right to repair” bill that would help people get equipment fixed without having to pay exorbitant prices to the original manufacturer. Kent, a former Green Beret who has called for the impeachment of President Joe Biden, cited inflation and illegal immigration as top concerns.  The two disagreed on a major local issue: the replacement of a major bridge across the Columbia River between Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington. Gluesenkamp Perez supports plans to replace the existing bridge; Kent argued that a separate new bridge should be built while the old one is maintained.  Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.
