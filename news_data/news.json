            "content": " San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Mitch Johnson is expected to serve as the interim head coach indefinitely while head coach Gregg Popovich is dealing with a \"health issue,\" according to ESPN's Shams Charania. Charania reported the situation for Popovich arose before Saturday's 113-103 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. The 75-year-old wasn't on the bench due to an undisclosed illness. \"Mitch did a great job,\" point guard Chris Paul said after the victory. \"Things happen within this league all the time, and just like with players it's 'next man up.' So shout out to Mitch.\" Johnson began his coaching career in 2016 with the Austin Spurs of the NBA G League. He moved on to San Antonio in 2019 and steadily moved up the bench with the departures of Tim Duncan, Becky Hammon and Will Hardy. Popovich's reputation precedes him. He's widely regarded as one of the greatest head coaches ever, boasting five titles and an all-time record of 1,391 wins in the regular season. With the Spurs heading toward 22 wins and a total rebuild in 2022-23, it looked like his legendary career was starting to wind down. Then San Antonio won the 2023 draft lottery and earned the right to take Victor Wembanyama first overall. Perhaps not coincidentally, Popovich penned a five-year deal reportedly worth more than $80 million ahead of the 2023-24 season. That eliminated any doubt about his short-term future. The Spurs matched their 22-60 record despite Wembanyama's arrival and his immediate emergence as a one-of-a-kind talent. Their 3-3 start points to what should be some progress on the court this year."

Seven battleground states, any of which could potentially swing to either the Democrats or Republicans, hold the keys to the presidency. Both Harris and Trump have made repeated visits to these seven competitive states, where CBS News polling shows the candidates were virtually tied in the lead-up to Election Day after a hard-fought campaign. CBS News considers these the battleground states in the 2024 presidential election: Arizona has 11 electoral votes, and its polls close at 9 p.m. ET on Election Day. Trump won Arizona in 2016, but then lost it narrowly to President Biden in 2020.  Georgia has 16 electoral votes, and the polls close at 7 p.m. ET. Trump won the state in 2016, but in 2020, Mr. Biden beat him by fewer than 12,000 votes — the first time a Democratic candidate had won the state since Bill Clinton in 1992. Allegations that Trump and more than a dozen allies engaged in a criminal conspiracy to overturn Georgia's 2020 results are now at the center of an election interference case in Fulton County; Trump denies wrongdoing. Michigan's 15 electoral votes went to Trump in 2016 after almost three decades of supporting Democrats for president. The state flipped in 2020, with Mr. Biden taking the win. Michigan is part of the so-called \"blue wall\" of Midwestern states considered crucial for Democrats. Rep. Debbie Dingell recently said she believes her state will remain competitive until the last vote is counted on Election Day. The first polls in Michigan close at 8 p.m. ET, but some are in a different time zone and close at 9 p.m. ET. Nevada has voted Democratic for the past four presidential elections. With six electoral votes, Nevada has the smallest total of the seven presidential battleground states. Polls close in the state at 10 p.m. ET. North Carolina is still dealing with the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Both candidates have visited since the storm. Democrats have won the state's 16 electoral votes only twice since 1968, most recently in 2008 when voters backed Barack Obama. Trump edged out Mr. Biden in the state in 2020 by a little more than 1 point, and also bested Hillary Clinton in the state in 2016. Polls in North Carolina close at 7:30 p.m. ET. Pennsylvania, with its 19 electoral votes, is a critical battleground for Harris and Trump. Mr. Biden took the state in 2020, while Trump won there in 2016. Harris and Trump have visited the state at least 20 times each in the months leading up to the election. Polls in Pennsylvania close at 8 p.m. ET. Wisconsin voters backed Democrats for decades until 2016, when Trump flipped the state and secured its 10 electoral votes. Voters swung back in 2020, when Mr. Biden won the state. The state was decided by less than 1% in the last two elections. Polls in Wisconsin close at  9 p.m. ET. CBS News' Battleground Tracker provides the latest estimates of support for Harris and Trump in these states as the 2024 campaign comes to a close. Estimates are based on CBS News/YouGov polling and analysis.  The findings below also include Nebraska's competitive 2nd Congressional District; Nebraska is one of two states, along with Maine, that allows splitting up its electoral votes. A battleground state — sometimes known as a swing state — has a population of voters who are almost evenly divided politically heading into the election. While many states vote fairly consistently for either Democrats or Republicans, both parties see a chance to win in the battlegrounds and invest a huge amount of money and time into campaigning in these states.

            "content": "Watch CBS News \nNovember 4, 2024 / 10:05 AM EST\n          / CBS/AFP\n         Moldova's pro-European Union incumbent President Maia Sandu won a tense presidential runoff election Sunday, beating a rival backed by a pro-Russian party in what she called as a \"lesson in democracy.\"  The election in the small ex-Soviet republic, which lies sandwiched between war-torn Ukraine and the European Union, was overshadowed by allegations of meddling by Moscow. The key vote took place just two weeks after a referendum saw Moldovans back their country's bid to join the EU by a razor-thin margin.  Sandu won 54.94 percent of the vote compared to 45.06 percent for Alexandr Stoianoglo, who was supported by the pro-Russian Socialists party and whom Sandu fired as prosecutor general last year, according to near-complete results published by the country's election commission. \"Today, dear Moldovans, you have given a lesson in democracy, worthy of being written in history books.... Freedom, truth, and justice have prevailed,\" Sandu declared.   Her rival Stoianoglo, 57, urged people \"to remain calm, regardless of the figures,\" but the Socialists party that backed him was quick to release a statement Monday questioning the results and calling her \"illegitimate,\" without offering any specific evidence. \"Maia Sandu is an illegitimate president, recognized only by her sponsors and supporters abroad. The people of Moldova feel betrayed and robbed,\" the party claimed in a statement, decrying \"blocking of voters' access\" and other alleged irregularities in the vote, in which Sandu benefitted from strong support from the country's large diaspora. In a statement issued Monday morning by the White House, President Biden said the Moldovan people \"went to the polls and voted in favor of President Sandu's vision for a secure, prosperous, and democratic Moldova.\" \"For months, Russia sought to undermine Moldova's democratic institutions and election processes. But Russia failed,\" Mr. Biden said. \"The Moldovan people have exercised their democratic right to choose their own future, and they have chosen to pursue a path aligned with Europe and democracies everywhere.\" EU chief Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Sandu on her re-election victory and the country's \"European future,\" saying it took \"a rare kind of strength to overcome the challenges you've faced in this election.\" French President Emmanuel Macron said democracy had \"triumphed over all interference and all manuevers.\" Sandu's victory was also applauded by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday. His country, which Russia launched its ongoing full-scale invasion of almost three years ago, surrounds Moldova on three sides. \"Moldovans have made a clear choice,\" Zelenskyy said Monday. \"They chose a path toward economic growth and social stability.\"  He vowed to strengthen Ukraine's ties with Moldova and noted that both countries had applied to join the EU in the wake of Russia's February 2022 invasion.  \"Only true security and a peaceful, united Europe can guarantee each person and every family the confidence to face tomorrow with hope and certainty,\" he said. Accession negotiations for Moldova to join the EU formally opened in June. In the October 20 referendum, 50.35 percent of voters backed EU membership, with Sandu blaming \"foreign interference\" for the narrow result in the country of 2.6 million people. Like in Georgia, another ex-Soviet country where the ruling party won a contested parliamentary election last weekend, Russia has been accused of seeking to sway voters. Moscow has denied the allegations. Police said after the EU referendum that they had uncovered a Russian vote-buying scheme that could have affected up to a quarter of the ballots, and Moldovan authorities reported \"attacks, provocations and attempts at destabilization\" on Sunday.  Police said they were investigating Russia's alleged use of \"organized transportation\" to Belarus, Azerbaijan and Turkey so people living in Russia could vote at Moldovan missions in those countries.  Cyberattacks and fake bomb threats also targeted out-of-country voting operations, authorities said. Turnout was higher than in the first round on October 20, when Sandu came out ahead with 42.5 percent and runner-up Stoianoglo got 26 percent. Casting his vote on Sunday, Stoianoglo said he had \"no relations with the Kremlin.\"  While he's said he also favors joining the EU, he boycotted the referendum. Moldova is deeply polarized. A large diaspora and the capital mostly favor joining the EU, while rural areas and the pro-Russian separatist regions of Transnistria and Gagauzia are against it.  Sandu lost in the territory of Moldova itself, election results showed, with her owing her victory to the diaspora.  \"This is what tipped the election,\" said Florent Parmentier, a political scientist at Paris-based Sciences Po, noting Sandu's \"dependence on the outside.\" To maintain its pro-EU course, Moldova needs \"a lot of help\" given \"the hybrid war waged by Russia,\" according to Andrei Curararu, an analyst at the Chisinau-based WatchDog think tank.  \"It will not succeed on its own,\" he said, earlier citing \"unprecedented pressure\" with more than $100 million estimated to have been spent on \"destabilization activities.\" \n© 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

FOX Weather Hurricane Specialist Bryan Norcross takes a deep dive into the forecast details and explains what could be next for the latest tropical depression of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. Editor's note: Tropical Depression 18 has become Tropical Storm Rafael. Updates on this story have moved here. MIAMI – Millions of people from the Caribbean to the U.S. Gulf Coast are keeping their eyes on Tropical Depression Eighteen as the system becomes better organized and is forecast to become Hurricane Rafael in the coming days. According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Tropical Depression Eighteen will likely strengthen into Tropical Storm Rafael as it approaches Jamaica and will continue to strengthen on its journey north. Rafael is expected to be near or at hurricane strength as it moves toward the Cayman Islands and Cuba, according to the NHC. HOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER Tropical Depression Eighteen, which was previously designated Potential Tropical Cyclone Eighteen, has maximum sustained winds of 35 mph and is located about 200 miles to the south of Kingston, Jamaica. The NHC says tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in Jamaica later on Monday night, while hurricane conditions are expected in the Cayman Islands starting by Tuesday afternoon and in western Cuba on Wednesday. Due to the potential threat that Tropical Depression Eighteen poses, a Tropical Storm Warning was issued for Jamaica and a Hurricane Warning was issued for the Cayman Islands. In addition, Hurricane and Tropical Storm Watches were issued for portions of Cuba. The NHC says that those with interests in the Florida Keys should closely monitor the progress of Tropical Depression Eighteen, as Tropical Storm Watches could be issued for the region later Monday. WHAT TO DO WHEN WATCHES OR WARNINGS ARE ISSUED FOR YOUR TOWN According to the NHC, Tropical Depression Eighteen will continue to move off to the north Monday and make a turn to the northwest later in the day. That motion is expected for the next few days. Tropical Depression Eighteen will be near or over Jamaica on Monday night and be near or over the Cayman Islands on Tuesday. Tropical Depression Eighteen is then expected to approach Cuba on Wednesday. The NHC says Tropical Depression Eighteen will bring heavy rain to portions of the western Caribbean, including Jamaica and portions of Cuba through midweek, increasing the risk of flooding and mudslides across the region. Heavy precipitation is also expected to spread into Florida and the Southeast by mid- to late-week. \n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or\n        redistributed. ©2024 FOX News Network, LLC.

Prior videos have focused on the iPhone 16, but the MacBook Pro is highlighted here—fitting for the new workplace focus. Like previous ads, the new Apple Intelligence office videos strike a humorous tone as people find themselves in situations where AI saves them from embarrassment. The workplace focus is new for Apple’s marketing, and the use of the MacBook Pro is fitting with the new M4 models shipping later this week. Both videos show how macOS 15.1’s new AI writing tools can help save you from common workplace situations. The first video, ‘Change your tone,’ has its subject writing an angry email after someone steals their pudding from the office fridge. He ends up using writing tools to change the email to a ‘Friendly’ tone, which gets him his pudding back. The second video, ‘Catch up quick,’ finds its subject in a meeting tasked with running through a document that they’ve never previously read. Writing tools’ ability to create bullet points out of text proves a lifesaver. Here are the new videos: What do you think of the new Apple Intelligence office videos? Can AI help you at work?

            "content": "\n            • Final push: Tomorrow is Election Day. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are in battleground states that could determine who wins the presidency.\n     \n• Dueling events: Harris was holding five events in Pennsylvania, concluding the day in Philadelphia. Meanwhile, Trump is visiting three states: North Carolina, Pennsylvania and will wrap with a rally in Michigan.\n     \n            • Voter resources: See CNN’s voter handbook for how to vote in your area, and read up on the 2024 candidates and their proposals on key issues. Catch up here on how US elections work.\n     \nOur live coverage of the presidential race has moved here.\n \n            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, looked to sell Kamala Harris’ vision for America to women voters in Michigan Monday over their opponent, Donald Trump, who has faced a widening gender gap in his support.\n     \n        “Tomorrow, women all across America, of every age, both parties, are going to send a loud message to Donald Trump, whether he likes it or not,” Walz told the crowd in Detroit, riffing on Trump saying at a recent rally he wants to protect women “whether the women like it or not.”“Here it is folks, it’s our moment. The election is here. The momentum is on our side. With one or two votes per precinct in the state Michigan, we can win the whole damn thing,” he said, asking the crowd to “bring this thing home for America.”\n     \n \n            It’s the latest battleground state stop for the Minnesota governor, who has crisscrossed the country touting Harris’ vision for America.\n     \nMichigan’s political landscape: Michigan is one of the critical “blue wall” states Democrats are hoping to pick up in order to win the presidential race. Nearly 3.2 million people have already voted in the state, which amounts to about 44% of active registered voters.\n     \nThis post has been updated with additional remarks from Walz.\n \n            When Americans cast their votes on November 5, they are not directly electing the presidential candidates themselves. Voters are casting ballots for competing slates of “electors” who will in turn cast the actual votes for president and vice president on December 17.\n     \n            Collectively, the electors from all 50 states and the District of Columbia are referred to the “Electoral College.” The presidential candidate who wins the majority of the popular vote on election night does not necessarily win the White House. In order to win the presidency, a candidate must win a majority of votes in the Electoral College.\n     \n            The Electoral College is comprised of 538 electors who represent all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Each state has between three and 54 electoral votes. A candidate needs a majority of electoral votes – 270 – to win.\n     \n            In 48 states and the District of Columbia, all electoral votes are awarded to the candidate who wins a plurality of the popular vote in that state. This is known as the “winner-take-all” system. Two states – Maine and Nebraska – do not award their electoral votes according to a winner-take-all system.\n     \n            Read more about the Electoral College below:\n     \nRead more about how the US election works.\n \n            A poll worker in central Georgia was arrested on federal charges Monday for making bomb threats to other poll workers in a letter mailed to the Jones County Elections Superintendent, the Justice Department said.\n     \n            Nicholas Wimbish, 25, of Milledgeville, Georgia, has been charged with mailing a bomb threat, conveying false information about a bomb threat, mailing a threatening letter, and making false statements to the FBI.\n     \n            Wimbish was serving as a poll worker at the Jones County Elections Office on October 16 when he allegedly had a verbal altercation with a voter, according to a criminal complaint. The following day, Wimbish mailed a letter addressed to the Jones County Elections Superintendent that he “allegedly drafted to make it appear as if it came from a voter,” the complaint said.\n     \n            Prosecutors said the letter threatened that Wimbish and others “should look over their shoulder,” that “I know where they go,” and also threatened to “rage rape” the “ladies” and warned them to “watch every move they make and look over their shoulder.”\n     \n            The letter concluded with a handwritten note, “PS boom toy in early vote place, cigar burning, be safe,” according to the complaint.\n     \n            CNN did not immediately identify an attorney for Wimbish. If convicted, he faces a maximum of 25 years in prison.\n     \n            “It is disturbing,” Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer with the Republican Georgia secretary of state, told CNN about the incident.\n     \n            “These are your neighbors, your fellow Americans, fellow Georgians. These guys are just doing their jobs. They are being threatened this way and it’s not fair. I also know that particular office and all of our offices are resilient, and nothing will stop them from doing their job,” Sterling said.\n     \n            The FBI Atlanta Field Office is investigating the case.\n     \n            Former President Donald Trump continued pushing unfounded claims of cheating on the eve of the election as he called the Democratic Party “vicious machine” and claimed states are an “agent of the federal government.”\n     \n        “This is that big, powerful, vicious party, though. No, it’s a vicious machine. I mean, they can take all these bad ideas and win elections. It’s like, there’s only a way you can do that. One way, there’s only one way,” Trump said during his rally in Pittsburgh.\n     \n \n        “We have to win the old-fashioned way and then fix it,” he said. “But we have to fix it. We can’t allow this to happen. And remember, the states are essentially an agent, if I can use that term, but they’re an agent of the federal government. The states are doing the collecting, so to speak, and they have to take their orders from the federal government. And how can they do this when they say it’s going to take days long.”\n     \n \n            Trump, who regularly lies about the outcome of the 2020 election, said it was “the worst thing that ever happened to the country.”\n     \n            “They wanted to make a deal so badly and then we had that bad election, that horrible disgusting, worst thing that ever happened to the country was that election,” Trump said.\n     \n            Trump said the race against Vice President Kamala Harris was “really not tight” as polls show the two candidates deadlocked nationally.\n     \n            Vice President Kamala Harris continued to mobilize Pennsylvania voters the night before the election, telling a crowd in Pittsburgh that they “will make the difference in the election.”\n     \n            During a roughly 11-minute truncated stump speech, Harris reiterated that “momentum is on our side,” as she vowed to offer a new generation of leadership.\n     \n        “Pittsburgh, this is it. Tomorrow is election day. Tomorrow is election day, and the momentum is on our side. Our campaign has tapped into the ambitions, the aspirations and the dreams of the American people, and we know it is time for a new generation of leadership in America,” Harris said during a rally at the Carrie Blast Furnaces National Historic Landmark.\n     \n \n            “I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States,” she said.\n     \n            Similar to her prior events today, Harris avoided mentioning Donald Trump by name, instead outlining her vision of moving past “a decade of politics driven by fear and division.”\n     \n            “We have an opportunity in this election to finally turn the page on a decade of politics driven by fear and division,” Harris said. “We are done with that. We’re done. We’re done. We’re exhausted with it — and Pittsburgh, we are not going back.”\n     \n            The nominees on the Republican and Democratic tickets spent the final day of an extraordinary US presidential campaign rallying supporters in critical battleground states.\n     \n            The dash to motivate voters in what appears to be a toss-up election was happening as election officials were beefing up security amid a warning from US intelligence agencies of “global efforts to manipulate US public opinion.”\n     \n            Here’s what to know:\n     \nKamala Harris: The vice president spent the day in different parts of Pennsylvania as her campaign officials projected optimism about what they’ve frequently called an aggressive ground game in the state while acknowledging it’s going to be a close race.\n     \n            Here’s what Harris did today so far today: The campaign concludes later tonight with a rally in Philadelphia. So far, she’s gone door-knocking in Reading, presented a vision of unity and togetherness to people canvassing for her in Scranton and declared her long-standing commitment to Puerto Rico in Allentown.\n     \nTim Walz: The Minnesota governor kicked off his last day of campaigning with a celebratory send off in his hometown of Minneapolis with dozens of supporters, including high-ranking Minnesota Democratic allies.\n     \n            He spent his day in different parts of Wisconsin: He touted Harris’ record, credited her for bringing “back joy to the politics,” and projected optimism for tomorrow, when voters get to “shape the future for generations to come.” he said at a rally in Milwaukee.\n     \nDonald Trump: The former president hit three battleground states. In his rally in North Carolina, Trump said he was visiting to urge people to “get out and vote,” adding, “if we get everybody out and vote there’s not a thing they can do.” In Reading, Pennsylvania, he suggested Harris should be put “in the ring” with former heavyweight champion boxer Mike Tyson, while in Pittsburgh, the former president hailed a late endorsement from influential podcaster Joe Rogan. Trump is scheduled to hold his final rally tonight in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n     \nJD Vance: The Ohio senator also jetted around across the country to urge people to get out the vote. In La Crosse, Wisconsin, he criticized Harris’ work on immigration. In Flint, Michigan, he said leaders like Harris have “failed to do their job” and Trump could usher in a “golden age of American prosperity.” In Atlanta, he pointed to President Joe Biden’s narrow margin of victory in 2020, and urged people to go vote.\n     \nLegal challenges:\n \nDisinformation:\n \n            Vice President Kamala Harris is speaking at a rally in Pittsburgh as she continues on a campaign blitz in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania.\n     \n            Her stop in Pittsburgh is her third in the state on the eve of Election Day after rallies in Scranton and Allentown and ahead of her final stop in Philadelphia where she will be joined by Oprah Winfrey and Lady Gaga, among other celebrities, musicians and elected officials. That state is considered one of the most important battlegrounds this election cycle.\n     \n            Popular podcast host Joe Rogan officially endorsed Donald Trump on the eve of the election, a move Trump’s team swiftly touted as a major win in the final hours of their campaign.\n     \n            Advertising a recent interview with Elon Musk on X, Rogan said the billionaire “makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you’ll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way.\n     \n        “For the record, yes, that’s an endorsement of Trump,” Rogan’s post on X read. \n     \n \n            At a rally in Pittsburgh Monday, Trump hailed an endorsement from Rogan.\n     \n            “It just came over the wires that Joe Rogan just endorsed me, is that great. Thank you, Joe. That’s so nice. And he doesn’t do that, and he tends to be a little bit more liberal than some of the people in this room now,” Trump said.\n     \n            Trump last month appeared on Rogan’s podcast, which is consistently the No. 1 podcast across the globe, after years of Rogan saying he would not have the former president on his podcast and recent attacks from Trump himself.\n     \n            “I’m not a Trump supporter in any way, shape or form. I’ve had the opportunity to have him on my show more than once. I’ve said no every time. I don’t want to help him. I’m not interested in helping him,” Rogan said on the Lex Fridman Podcast in 2022. Rogan seemingly endorsed progressive Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders for president in 2020.\n     \n            The interview was months in the making for the Trump campaign and viewed widely by the former president’s advisers as the crowning achievement of their media strategy to target young men and low propensity voters by having Trump appear on podcasts catering to the demographic.\n     \n            Last week Rogan posted on X that he had declined an offer from Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign to do an interview.\n     \n            “Also, for the record the Harris campaign has not passed on doing the podcast. They offered a date for Tuesday, but I would have had to travel to her and they only wanted to do an hour. I strongly feel the best way to do it is in the studio in Austin,” Rogan said. “My sincere wish is to just have a nice conversation and get to know her as a human being. I really hope we can make it happen.”\n     \n            The Harris campaign declined to comment on Rogan’s post.\n     \n            CNN’s Kate Sullivan and Shania Shelton contributed to this report.\n     \n            When CNN hosted a town hall with undecided voters in Pennsylvania two weeks ago, Pam Thistle was still debating which candidate to support. Now, on the eve of the election, Thistle tells CNN she plans to officially make up her mind tomorrow, but is leaning toward voting for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n     \n            Thistle is a Pennsylvania realtor who recently lost her husband and, as a widow with children to support, said the economy and paying her bills is her top concern. She’s approached her 2024 choice through a pragmatic lens, often listening closely for the specifics on policies and expressing dismay at personal attacks lobbed during the race.\n     \n            Thistle said she prefers former President Trump when it comes to handling the economy or dealing with foreign policy. But abortion is also an important issue for her and, in the end, she may just feel more comfortable with Harris as the next commander-in-chief. Thistle added that she “adores” Harris personally.\n     \n            Thistle told CNN Monday night that she remains undecided but is leaning toward Harris. She’s not 100% decided and will make a final call when she wakes up — on Election Day.\n     \n            In a last-ditch effort to make voters aware of alleged foreign interference in the 2024 election, the US intelligence community issued a statement late Monday warning about global efforts to manipulate US public opinion and the possible violence that could come as a result.\n     \n            The US intelligence community “has been observing foreign adversaries, particularly Russia, conducting additional influence operations intended to undermine public confidence in the integrity of U.S. elections and stoke divisions among Americans,” the FBI, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in a joint statement hours before Election Day 2024.\n     \n        “The [intelligence community] expects these activities will intensify through election day and in the coming weeks, and that foreign influence narratives will focus on swing states,” the warning continued.\n     \n \n            The new statement comes after the intelligence community warned last Friday of a fake online video purporting to depict a Haitian citizen boasting about illegally voting in the state of Georgia.\n     \nCNN reported earlier Monday that an American man who lives in Massachusetts and is a pro-Trump social media influencer said he was the one behind that fake video and that he was paid $100 by a pro-Kremlin propagandist to post it online.\n     \n            “Russia is the most active threat,” the new statement warns. “Influence actors linked to Russia in particular are manufacturing videos and creating fake articles to undermine the legitimacy of the election, instill fear in voters regarding the election process, and suggest Americans are using violence against each other due to political preferences, judging from information available to the IC. These efforts risk inciting violence, including against election officials. We anticipate Russian actors will release additional manufactured content with these themes through election day and in the days and weeks after polls close.”\n     \n            In addition to warning about Kremlin-backed interference, the US intelligence community said Iran “remains a significant foreign influence threat to U.S. elections.”\n     \n            Former President Donald Trump brought out prominent talk show host Megyn Kelly at his Pittsburgh rally tonight.\n     \n            “Hi everybody. It’s great to see you. Can you believe this guy? Can you believe the energy and the stamina on this guy at his age? I’m ready to go to sleep over there,” Kelly said, standing next to Trump.\n     \n            Kelly’s support for Trump comes after she feuded with the former president during his first presidential run. In 2015, Trump said that the then-Fox News host had “blood coming out of her wherever” when at a Republican debate Kelly pressed Trump about misogynistic, sexist comments he made in the past, such as calling some women “fat pigs.”\n     \n            “President Trump gets it,” Kelly said at Monday’s rally. “He will not look at our boys like they’re second-class citizens. And ladies out there who want a bit of girl power in this election, let me tell you something. How can you win when the sons and the husbands and the brothers and the dads you love are losing? It’s not a win.”\n     \nKelly last month also criticized Trump’s campaign last week on “The Megyn Kelly Show,” calling for Trump to “clean up the bro talk” so he doesn’t alienate women following the racist and vulgar rhetoric from speakers at his Madison Square Garden rally.\n     \n            Ohio Sen. JD Vance continued his closing attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday, calling her a “disaster” in front of hundreds of a supporters at a rally in Newtown, Pennsylvania.\n     \n        “This is when I tell you what I really think about Kamala Harris,” Vance said. “Kamala Harris, she is a disaster, and we’re not going to let her become president of the United States.”\n     \n \n            “Do you like being unable to afford groceries that vote for Kamala Harris? Are you excited about World War III? Because that’s what’s going to happen when Kamala Harris is the president of the United States. Do you love that wide open southern border given to you by … Kamala Harris. Then tomorrow is your one opportunity to say ‘we’ve had it.’ Tomorrow is your one opportunity to say to ‘Kamala Harris, you’re fired. Get the hell out of Washington. Go back to San Francisco, where you belong,’” Vance said.\n     \n            Vance made stops in Atlanta, Georgia; Flint, Michigan, and La Crosse, Wisconsin on Monday.\n     \nPennsylvania’s political landscape: In 2020, President Joe Biden beat former President Donald Trump in the Keystone State by more than 80,000 votes, rebuilding the so-called “blue wall” along with Wisconsin and Michigan, that Trump flipped in 2016. Recent CNN polling shows that Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are tied in Pennsylvania.\n     \n            President Joe Biden will spend Election Day behind closed doors with no public events on his schedule.\n     \n            The president voted last week in Wilmington, Delaware.\n     \n            Law enforcement responded Monday to address a briefly tense situation with poll observers at an elections office in Cobb County, Georgia.\n     \n            Election observers refused to move from seats that were reserved for voters and election officials called on law enforcement to respond, according to Cobb County Communications Director Ross Cavitt. By the time deputies arrived, the situation had been diffused, Cavitt said.\n     \n            A nonpartisan election observer who did not wish to be named described the GOP poll observers as “confrontational” with staff. In one incident, election staff intervened to try to stop observers from photographing a voter, the observer said.\n     \n            The observer praised election staffers for working in stressful conditions to address issues with poll watchers, saying, “I think there has been a great deal of work trying to prevent this from having any intimidating or uncomfortable effect on voters.”\n     \n            Salleigh Grubbs, the chair of the Cobb County GOP who has shared falsehoods about the 2020 election, pointed the finger at local officials, saying the situation was tense because “there’s definitely an attempt by some people with the board of elections to not have people observe like they should.” She said the incident was about an observer trying to capture a photo of a ballot they found to be “unusual.”\n     \n            Former President Donald Trump is holding a rally in Pittsburgh the day before the election.\n     \n            Trump’s rally comes as both he and Vice President Kamala Harris criss-cross Pennsylvania, considered the most crucial battleground state, in the closing hours of this campaign.\n     \n            While not his final rally of the evening, aides of former President Donald Trump are describing his speech in Pittsburgh as his “closing message” to the American people.\n     \n            In the remarks expected to occur this hour, Trump is expected to focus on the issues that his campaign believe can help propel him to the White House including inflation, immigration and crime.\n     \n            Trump’s event in the critical battleground state will also feature some high-profile speakers like former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Megyn Kelly.\n     \n            Following the final keystone state rally, Trump will end his campaign in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he ended both his 2016 and 2020 campaigns. That speech is now not expected to occur until at least 11:30 p.m. ET because Trump has been running late.\n     \n            Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz on Monday said this election will allow voters to shape the future.\n     \n        “We get an opportunity tomorrow to shape the future for generations to come,” he said to supporters at a rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. “We get a chance to elect a new generation of leadership and have Kamala Harris lead us forward.”\n     \n \n        “We’re running like everything is on the line, because it is,” he said as the crowd cheered.\n     \n \n            He said the last 107 days of the Harris campaign have been “an incredible journey,” and credited the vice president for bringing “back the joy to politics.”\n     \n            Throughout her career as a prosecutor, an attorney general, a senator and a vice president, Harris has had “one client the entire time — the people of this country,” Walz said.\n     \n            In his remarks, Walz reflected on his background growing up in rural Nebraska and connected the values he was raised with to those that guide Harris, acknowledging their shared working-class roots.\n     \n            “Those are the values that animated Kamala and my service. That’s the values that after tomorrow, we’ll be able to take to the White House for the rest of this,” he said.\n     \nThis post was updated with more of Walz’s remarks. CNN’s Aaron Pellish contributed to this report.\n \n            Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz is speaking at a rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n     \nRemember: Wisconsin is a key battleground state. Four of the last six presidential elections were decided in the state by less than a percentage point on the presidential level. One of the most politically divided states in the nation, Wisconsin reelected Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in 2022.\n     \n            Democrats are hoping to maximize turnout in Milwaukee and Madison, while cutting the margins in the “WOW” counties – the Republican stronghold counties of Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington that surround Milwaukee.\n     \n            Former President Donald Trump on Monday suggested his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, should be put “in the ring” with former heavyweight champion boxer Mike Tyson.\n     \n            During a rally in Reading, Pennsylvania, Trump was discussing the controversy involving women’s boxing at the Olympics this year. He falsely said two boxers were men who “transitioned into womanhood.”\n     \n            “Did you see the two boxers? Did you see the two boxers - they were men, they transitioned into womanhood. And they fought a very good Italian. They have women’s boxing in the Olympics. They fought a very good Italian young lady, and boom, she got hit with just the left jab,” Trump said.\n     \n            Trump was apparently addressing the controversy surrounding Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, who became the subject of a storm of online abuse after she defeated Italian boxer Angela Carini in just 46 seconds in a preliminary match.\n     \n            Khelif, who is not transgender, was subject to a storm of transphobic abuse because she had failed a so-called “gender test” by a now-discredited boxing federation. Her country, Algeria, has strict anti-LGBTQ laws. A boxer from Taiwan, Lin Yu-ting, was subject to a similar controversy over baseless allegations she is transgender.\n     \n            Trump continued: “Oh, they could fight Iron Mike. I’ll tell ya – Iron Mike would say ‘This is not a good thing.’ I know Iron Mike, and he’s a great guy, Mike Tyson. He’s a good man. Mike’s been through a lot but he could fight, let me tell ya. That guy could fight.”\n     \n            Trump continued: “Can you imagine Mike - “ before, apparently responding to someone from the audience, he said: “Oh, he says, ‘Put Mike in the ring with Kamala.’ That will be interesting.”\n     \n            Tyson has a history of violence against women, including being convicted of rape in the early 1990s, for which he served time in prison, and his first wife alleged that he abused her before they divorced.\n     \n            Trump has long supported Tyson, including saying that the boxer didn’t deserve to go to prison on the rape charges.\n \n            An American social media influencer said he was paid $100 by a pro-Kremlin propagandist to post a fake video of Haitian immigrants claiming to vote in the US presidential election. The payment was one of several the man said he received from the propagandist — a registered Russian agent — to post on social media in the run-up to the election.\n     \n            The pro-Trump influencer, who uses the @AlphaFox78 handle on X, is an American man living in Massachusetts, CNN has learned. He agreed to speak to CNN about the posts on condition of anonymity.\n     \n            The account, which has a history of posting right-wing memes in support of former President Donald Trump, was the first to post the now-debunked video that purportedly showed a Haitian immigrant claiming he would vote at least twice in Georgia for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n     \n            The Georgia Secretary of State said everything in that video was faked, from the actors to the ID cards, and was produced and disseminated by Russian influence actors.\n     \n            In phone and text interviews with CNN over multiple days, the person behind the account, which has amassed more than 650,000 followers on X, said he posted the video without fact-checking the claims made in it.\n     \n            “I don’t have any idea where it came from or anything — I’m just the guy who shared it,” he said.\n     \n            The man said Simeon Boikov, a Russian propagandist podcaster known online as “AussieCossack,” offered him $100 to post the video, which he agreed to. A person with knowledge of the situation confirmed to CNN that multiple payments were sent from Boikov to the Massachusetts man.\n     \n            Documents reviewed by CNN show that Boikov is a registered foreign agent for Russia in Australia, where he works for Russian state media, writing and posting online in English and Russian.\n     \nRead more about the fake video here.\n \n            Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said she is positive that Vice President Kamala Harris will win the election on Tuesday and that she thinks people are going to be surprised by how many voters turn out to cast their vote based on their “deep belief in democracy.”\n     \n            The Minnesota lawmaker, who was with Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz earlier on Monday, told CNN she has noticed high energy across the seven battleground states around Harris and the campaign.\n     \n            Klobuchar said that other lawmakers and those who have been knocking on doors in key states have said that voters are telling them “they just can’t handle the chaos of Donald Trump.”\n     \n        “You’re going to be surprised in how many people are turning out and how many people are voting on freedom and their deep belief in democracy even if they don’t agree with everything that’s on the Democratic platform,” she said.\n     \n \n            Klobuchar said Harris is ending her campaign with a “positive, optimistic message and Donald Trump is spiraling — and that’s not what we need in a leader right now for this country.”\n     \n            From the beginning of her candidacy, Klobuchar said, Harris united the party and then started reaching out to Independents and Republicans.\n     \n            Vice President Kamala Harris went door knocking in Reading, Pennsylvania, where she stopped by two homes to greet voters.\n     \n            At the first home, Harris greeted a couple who had an adult son with the same name as her stepson, Cole. At the second home, Harris greeted a woman and her husband.\n     \n            “It’s the day before the election, but I just wanted to come by and say I hope to earn your vote,” Harris told them.\n     \n            The woman told Harris “you got my vote already,” adding that she will be working the polls tomorrow. She also explained that her husband will be voting for Harris on Election Day.\n     \n            Reading is one of the five scheduled stops for Harris across Pennsylvania on Monday, ending in Philadelphia.\n     \nStrategy in final hours before Election Day: Harris and senior campaign staffers have directed staffers to keep their heads down and focus on mobilizing voters, according to a Harris adviser, capitalizing on what the campaign argues is momentum on their side.\n     \n            Earlier Monday, Harris thanked volunteers at a canvassing event in Scranton, Pennsylvania. “What you all are signing up to do today, and what you’ve been doing, like let’s enjoy it,” she said.\n     \n            “Let’s get out the vote,” Harris chanted before telling the crowd: “Let’s win.”\n     \n            But while officials remain cautiously optimistic, they acknowledge it will be a close race — and a potentially lengthy process.\n     \n        “People are swinging between holy smokes we could win to it’s a toss-up to nobody knows,” one source familiar with the dynamic told CNN. In a call with reporters Monday, the Harris campaign offered its views on the timing of election results, suggesting that the team will remain “calm and confident” as votes come in.\n     \n \nRemember what’s at stake: Pennsylvania is the most important battleground state of the 2024 election. Both Harris and Donald Trump have made the commonwealth’s 20 electoral votes central to their respective paths to victory. In 2016, Trump became the first Republican to win Pennsylvania since George H.W. Bush in 1988. In 2020, Joe Biden, a Pennsylvania native, flipped the state. According to AdImpact, Pennsylvania voters have seen nearly $300 million worth of presidential advertising – the most of any state in the nation.\n     \n            At his third of four battleground stops on Monday, Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance looked to again tie Vice President Kamala Harris to the Biden administration’s record as he boasted about the “big tent” support for former President Donald Trump on Monday.\n     \n        “The whole argument of their campaign is that Tim Walz and Kamala Harris have nothing to do with the policies of the last three months, even though Kamala Harris is the sitting vice president of the United States,” he told the crowd in Atlanta.\n     \n \n        “When you put a teleprompter in front of her, Kamala Harris will talk a big game about what she’s going to do. And I think all of us are saying, Kamala, if you want to do all these things, why haven’t you done them already?” Vance said.\n     \n \n            As he often does, Vance called the Republican Party “big tent,” mentioning Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and former US Ambassador Nikki Haley, the latter who never ended up joining Trump on the campaign trail despite CNN previously reporting she was in talks to appear with him potentially at a Fox News town hall in late October.\n     \n            “We’ve got in this commonsense movement, we’ve got the lieutenant governor and the governor of Georgia, Nikki Haley on the right, and Tulsi Gabbard and Bobby Kennedy on the left. This is a big tent, my friends. So, it’s not just red team versus blue team,” Vance said.\n     \n            While Kemp is supporting Trump, he didn’t vote for him in the Republican primary. As CNN previously reported, Kemp refused to call a special legislative session to help Trump as he sought overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia.\n     \n            While speaking at a rally in Atlanta, GOP Sen. JD Vance on Monday urged Georgia voters to get out and vote as he pointed at the narrow victory for President Joe Biden there in 2020.\n     \n        “So here’s the thing, we’re done with early voting in the state of Georgia, so tomorrow is the day,” Vance said, adding that it is the day to vote for change, lower grocery prices, more affordable housing, to close the border and “tomorrow is the day to make Donald Trump president of the United States.”\n     \n \nEarly voting in Georgia ended on Friday and Republican election officials’ efforts to slow the tide of election misinformation have been hampered by deep mistrust between them and fellow conservatives.\n     \n            He pointed out that Biden narrowly won the Peach State in 2020. Biden defeated Trump in Georgia by less than 1 percentage point, becoming the first Democratic presidential nominee to win the state in nearly three decades.\n     \n            “So here’s the request that I’m going to make of every single person here. I want every single one of you again to get out there and vote for Donald J. Trump 10 times,” he joked, claiming that line would get him headlines for voter fraud.\n     \n            “The legal way to vote 10 times is to get your friends to the polls and take yourself to the polls and get nine of your friends and family to go along with you,” he said.\n     \n            Vance also hit Harris over the Biden administration’s policies, using dark rhetoric to describe immigration in Georgia, before also making a call for unity, saying “to not discard lifelong family relationships” or friendships “because people vote the wrong way.”\n     \n            He added, “in two days, we are going to take out the trash in Washington, DC, and the trash is named Kamala Harris.”\n     \n            A Pennsylvania judge ruled Monday that Elon Musk’s daily $1 million giveaway to voters can continue, in a victory for the tech billionaire, though the sweepstakes is set to end Tuesday on Election Day.\n     \n            Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas Judge Angelo Foglietta rejected arguments from the city’s district attorney, Larry Krasner, who argued that the sweepstakes was an illegal lottery that violated state law and must be halted immediately.\n     \n            Eli Witherby, a 20-year-old valet in Philadelphia, cast his ballot for former President Donald Trump, while his girlfriend cast hers for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n     \n            “Everyone’s entitled to their own opinions,” Witherby said. “At the end of the day, I’m gonna stick to my guns.”\n     \n            Two rowers, they met through mutual friends, and while they don’t talk politics too much, Witherby said they respect each other’s different views.\n     \n        “I love her very much. We’re a great couple. We don’t necessarily get into politics too much. We do know where each other stands. But it’s um, it’s interesting,” Witherby said.\n     \n \n            Witherby said Harris “wouldn’t be nominated for the presidential race if she was an idiot.”\n     \n            “She’s a smart woman. She’s very intelligent woman, but I believe that we need someone else who’s smarter, intelligent, who’s done it before,” he told CNN.\n     \n            One factor motivating Witherby to support Trump is the economy. “Everything was cheaper,” he said, referencing in particular the price of gasoline.\n     \n            Witherby, who lives in Philadelphia but is originally from Oklahoma, sees Democrats as “very polarizing” and didn’t appreciate President Joe Biden’s “garbage” gaffe.\n     \n            Witherby said he’s over the name-calling on both sides and that he was encouraged by the vice presidential debate between Sen. JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz.\n     \n            “The vice presidential debate was a breath of fresh air,” he said. “It gave me confidence for the future, if we had those two running for the presidency, that it would be, you know, I don’t have to worry about someone’s character being insulted on national television.”\n     \n            Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance is speaking now in Atlanta.\n     \n            The Republican senator from Ohio arrived in the battleground state of Georgia to talk to voters about immigration and the economy, according to the campaign’s website, after stops in Flint, Michigan, and La Crosse, Wisconsin, on Monday.\n     \nGeorgia political landscape: Neither Donald Trump nor Kamala Harris have a clear advantage in Georgia, according to CNN polls conducted by SSRS, with likely voters in Georgia divide 48% for Trump to 47% for Harris. In 2020, President Joe Biden was the first Democrat to win Georgia since Bill Clinton in 1992 and Arizona since Clinton in 1996.\n     \n            Former President Donald Trump on Monday said Vice President Kamala Harris “copied my routine” on Saturday Night Live after Harris appeared on the show over the weekend.\n     \n        “She uses everything I do. She uses… even Saturday Night Live they copied. They copied. Think of that. Saturday, oh she was great on — they copied my routine, I did it a long time ago, they copied the same routine. I think I did it better, actually. I think anybody could’ve done it. I think anybody could’ve done it better,” Trump said during his rally in Reading, Pennsylvania.\n     \n \n            Harris made an appearance on the show’s cold open on Saturday in a skit where comic and actress Maya Rudolph was playing Harris and talking to the real Harris through a mirror.\n     \n            Trump appeared on “The Tonight Show” in 2015 and participated in a similar skit where host Jimmy Fallon was playing Trump and talking to the real Trump through a mirror.\n     \n            Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday said she is “proud of my long-standing commitment to Puerto Rico and her people” as she rallied in Allentown, Pennsylvania, which includes a sizable Puerto Rican population.\n     \n            While Harris has largely shied away from mentioning her opponent during this final day of campaigning, her remarks were a subtle rebuttal to the rally former President Donald Trump held recently in Madison Square Garden, which featured a speaker who described Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.”\n     \n        “I am so thankful to everyone for being here, and including he leaders of the Puerto Rican community,” Harris said. “I stand here, proud of my long-standing commitment to Puerto Rico and her people, and I will be a president for all Americans.”\n     \n \n        “So, Allentown, this is it. Just one more day, one more day, one more day left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime, and momentum is on our side,” Harris added.\n     \n \n            A divided Georgia Supreme Court on Monday paused a state judge’s ruling that gave more than 3,000 voters in Cobb County several more days to return their absentee ballots after local election officials admitted they were late sending them out.\n     \n        “The Cobb County Board of Elections and Registration (the “Board”) may count only those absentee ballots received by the statutory deadline of 7:00 p.m. on Election Day, November 5, 2024,” the court said in a brief order. Three justices noted their dissent from the decision, and one justice was disqualified.\n     \n \n            The ruling will only affect the voters within a group of some 3,240 who live in the US and don’t get their absentee ballots in on time. Any voters in that group who live overseas will still have their ballots counted as long as they’re postmarked by Election Day and received by November 8.\n     \n            The Supreme Court’s order directs local election officials to segregate any ballots received after 7 p.m. on Election Day and before 5 p.m. on November 8 and to not destroy them “until further order of the Court.” Whether those late arrival ballots should be counted at all is a question that will be litigated after the election.\n     \n            The court’s decision is a major win for Republicans who argued that if the extension issued last week by a Cobb County judge remained intact, “state law is necessarily suspended … for only one group of voters.”\n     \n            A group of civil rights groups sued the county on Friday over its delay in getting the ballots out in a timely manner, saying it would lead to the disfranchisement of thousands of voters who might not be able to return the ballots in time to be counted. The county said in a statement a day earlier that “a surge of last-minute absentee ballot applications” was to blame for the delay in mailing several thousand of them out.\n     \n            The 2024 US election cycle has seen an “unprecedented amount of disinformation,” including falsehoods “aggressively peddled and amplified by our foreign adversaries at a greater scale than ever before,” a top US cyber official said on Monday.\n     \n        “There is a firehose of disinformation that the American people have been subjected to, continue to be subjected to,” Jen Easterly, head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told reporters in an update on the threat environment a day before Election Day.\n     \n \n            During the early voting period, there have also been “small-scale” incidents, such as the destruction of ballot drop boxes and low-level cyberattacks, but “nothing that has the potential to materially impact the outcome of the presidential election,” Easterly said.\n     \n            On Monday, multiple widely viewed posts on social media platform X featured fabricated election-related content purporting to come from major news outlets like CNN and CBS.\n     \n            CNN reported on Saturday that CISA has retreated from some of the key work it did in the 2020 election to counter false and viral information about voting spread by Americans.\n     \n            Asked if CISA plans to rebut false information about the election process spread by former President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, Easterly did not directly answer the question.\n     \n            “It is very unfortunate and very irresponsible for anybody of (a) position of influence, of authority — regardless of party or politics — to be spreading inaccurate information about our elections,” she said generally. “It is corrosive to our democracy; it does the work of our foreign adversaries for them and it’s creating very real threats to election officials of both parties.”\n     \n            Advisers, allies and aides have all implored former President Donald Trump to stay on message in the final day of his campaign, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n     \n            While there is an overall belief that nearly all voters have made up their mind with one day to go until Election Day, some close to Trump fear any unplanned, inappropriate or insulting rhetoric could potentially cause voters to stay home in a race where every vote counts.\n     \n            Yesterday in Pennsylvania, after Trump spent more than 20 minutes sowing doubt about the 2024 election, he suggested he wouldn’t mind people someone “shooting through the fake news” to get to him, in reference to his two assassination attempts. He also said he shouldn’t have left the White House.\n     \n            “How hard is it to get up there and said “Kamala broke it and I’ll fix it,” one ally said, expressing frustration at Trump’s comments.\n     \n            Senior advisers assured allies that Trump was aware of what was at stake. Later in the day Sunday and Monday morning he appeared to stick mainly to his prewritten remarks.\n     \n            Sources also said that allies had advised Trump to keep it tight and not deviate from the script too much, noting that his lengthy remarks were also an issue. Trump was two hours late for an event in North Carolina on Sunday, and by the time he started speaking, rally attendees were already leaving.\n     \n            Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt reiterated on Monday that it may take some time before all eligible votes are counted in the key battleground state.\n     \n            The Department of State “has never had final, official results on Election Night” regardless of when other projections come in, Schmidt said.\n     \n            Pennsylvania’s process for counting mail-in ballots is one reason why Schmidt said he cannot predict what percentage of eligible votes will be counted on Election Day and warned that it may take several days to know the official results.\n     \n            “Nearly 2 million mail-in ballots have already been returned,” Schmidt said, but cautioned that, unlike several other states, Pennsylvania counties cannot start opening mail-in ballots until 7:00 a.m. ET on Election Day.\n     \n            Counties will start submitting unofficial results once polls close around 8 p.m. local time and will continue to update those numbers throughout the night and the days that follow, he added.\n     \n            “All registered voters will have a chance to make their voices heard,” Schmidt said, urging the public to verify that election information is coming from trustworthy sources.\n     \n            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz expressed confidence about the outcome of the election and drew contrasts between his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Donald Trump.\n     \n            “We’re going to elect a new generation of leadership with Kamala Harris. A new way forward,” Walz said.\n     \n            The Democratic vice presidential candidate was speaking at an event in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, on Monday.\n     \n            He said that Harris’ speech last week on the Ellipse was what a president should sound like. He contrasted that with Trump’s rally in Madison Square Garden where speakers made a series of violent and vulgar remarks.\n     \n            “It may feel like we’re running like everything’s on the line – because it is,” Walz said.\n     \n            Walz talked about Harris’ background of being raised by a single mother and becoming a prosecutor who fought for other people. He said the vice president would be able to bring that experience to the White House to help Americans.\n     \n            “She and I want to build an economy that if you work hard, you don’t just barely skate by, you get a chance to get ahead,” Walz said, which includes people from all parts of the country. “Everybody in this country should get a shot to succeed.”\n     \n            He later told dozens of people gathered in an overflow room after the event that “the blue wall must hold,” and emphasized the importance of getting people to the polls.\n     \n            “All of the work, all of the ads, all the money, all the rhetoric really comes down to operationally how many people we get to the polls,” Walz said.\n     \nThis post has been updated with additional comments from Walz. CNN’s Aaron Pellish in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, contributed reporting.\n \n            A fake image showing fabricated vote results from CNN of Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump in Texas has been viewed millions of times on the social media platform X.\n     \n        “This image is completely fabricated and manipulated and it never aired on any CNN platform,” CNN said in a statement posted on X.\n     \n \n            But by Monday afternoon the fake image had been viewed at least 10 million times on X, shared mostly by pro-Trump paid and “verified” accounts, which means the posts have broader reach.\n     \n            Many of the accounts are falsely claiming the faked image shows plans to “steal” the election, or that CNN “accidentally” aired the image, which even in its faked form, shows an incomplete vote count.\n     \nThis post has been updated with new details.\n \nCorrection: An earlier version of this post incorrectly described the fake image.\n \n            Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz is speaking at an event in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, a key battleground state for Vice President Kamala Harris’ path to the White House.\n     \n            Harris and former President Donald Trump are tied in the presidential election, according to the polling. Both campaigns have spent significant time and money in the Badger state.\n     \n            The DC National Guard has been approved to assist DC Fire and Emergency Medical Services starting on Election Day through the following week, Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said on Monday.\n     \n            “(Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin) approved a request last week from the District of Columbia for DC National Guard troops to support the DC fire and emergency medical services from November 5 through 13,” Ryder said. Ryder noted that this is a routine practice for the Department of Defense to authorize the DC National Guard “to support or augment security for large scale events in the district, and activated guardsmen will remain under the command and control of the DC National Guard.”\n     \n            Ryder added that roughly 60 Guardsmen from six other states have been activated to support their states — though he did not say which states that included. Hundreds of other guardsmen are on standby to assist if needed, he said.\n     \n            A strong cold front will push east on Election Day, bringing rain to the critical battleground states of Wisconsin and Michigan with a widespread area of rain stretching from the Great Lakes to East Texas.\n     \n            Rainfall has been noted to slightly reduce voter turnout in previous elections.\n     \n            Wisconsin looks to have the worst weather of CNN’s seven battleground states, with widespread showers and even thunderstorms that could produce isolated wind gusts more than 60 mph and a brief tornado.\n     \n            Warm temperatures will create mild conditions for voters in eastern states, with record highs expected in Detroit (77 degrees F), Pittsburgh (81) and Albany, Georgia (86).\n     \nARIZONA: Temperatures are seasonal, or a bit cooler than average through Tuesday. Phoenix: Mostly sunny, cool. High: 73. Low: 50. Winds: E 5-10 mph.\n \nGEORGIA: Temperatures will climb around 10 degrees above average with record warm highs in the 80s for southern Georgia. Atlanta: Mostly cloudy but dry. High: 78. Low: 64. Winds: SE 10-15 mph.\n \nMICHIGAN: Skies stay overcast with healthy rain chances, especially for western parts of the state. Grand Rapids: Rain likely. High: 70 (Record 75 set in 1978). Low: 49. Winds: SSW 10-15 G 25 mph. Detroit: Mostly cloudy, breezy. Rain arrives late. High: 77 (Record 74 set in 2022). Low: 54. Winds: SSW 15-20 G 40 mph. \n \nNEVADA: It stays dry, sunny, and seasonal with temperatures right around average. Las Vegas: Mostly sunny. High: 69. Low: 47. Winds: Light and variable.\n \nNORTH CAROLINA:  Temperatures will be well above November’s average with highs in the middle and upper 70s. Raleigh: Mostly sunny, warm. High: 78. Low: 59. Winds: SE 5-10 mph. \n \nPENNSYLVANIA: A few clouds may roll in, but it stays incredibly warm and dry. Pittsburgh: Mostly sunny, very warm. High: 81 (Record 80 set in 1948). Low. 63. Winds: S 6-15 mph.\n \nWISCONSIN: Rain chances are high with totals mostly at or under 1 inch. Milwaukee: Rain likely. High: 65 (Record 73 set in 1978). Low: 41. Winds: SSW 15-20 mph.\n \n            Vice President Kamala Harris is speaking to voters in Allentown, Pennsylvania, ahead of polls closing on Election Day.\n \n            Her visit to Allentown is the second of several she plans to make throughout Pennsylvania on the eve of Election Day. That state is considered one of the most important battlegrounds this election cycle.\n     \n            Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign on the eve of the Election Day will host a series of interconnected “Get Out The Vote” events across battleground states — featuring famous artists and speakers, according to the campaign.\n     \n            The series of organizing events in all seven battleground states is “meant to capture the grassroots enthusiasm” and each event will be tied together with a national live stream show.\n     \n        “We’ll have elected officials and performers and speakers that really reach such a wide network across all social media platforms, helping to make sure that our message is breaking through in these final hours to voters that maybe are harder to reach or less engaged,” campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon told reporters Monday.\n     \n \n            O’Malley added that the events are meant to serve as “a massive mobilization and volunteer engagement opportunity. We’ll have organizing packet drop offs as part of it, of course, we would end with a big event that has a true organizing component to it. Front row seats are going to be given to folks who have completed phone banking and door knocking shifts over the last few days.”\n     \n            Vice President Kamala Harris plans to spend Election Day conducting radio interviews across battleground states, her campaign says, as she works to convince any remaining undecided voters to cast ballots for her in the final day of the campaign.\n     \n            After stumping in every swing state over the past week, Harris will be in Washington as the voting concludes. But she hopes to make one final push on the airwaves to anyone who hasn’t yet voted as she prepares for the results to start coming in.\n     \n            Harris’ communications director Michael Tyler said the interviews are intended to make sure “that those final voters who are on their way to work, on their way home taking a lunch break, understand the stakes, but understand her vision for where she wants to take this country over the course of the next four years.”\n     \n            The Harris campaign views its final-day mission both to convince any remaining undecided voters to support Harris while also mobilizing those who may not be regular or reliable voters to get to a polling station.\n     \n        “We’re very focused on making sure if you’re just tuning in, we’re going to deliver a message to you,” campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said. “If you’re someone that just has, like, a crazy, busy, hectic life and a lot going on tomorrow, we’re going to make sure we try to get to you so that you have the easiest way for you to go vote.”\n     \n \n            Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign continues to believe it has “multiple pathways” to 270 electoral votes and has not closed out any potential paths at this stage, campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said Monday.\n     \n            The path through the so-called “Blue Wall” states – Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania – remains the “most straightforward path,” but the campaign sees “equally favorable” paths in Sun Belt states, she said.\n     \n            The Harris campaign also offered its views on the timing of election results, suggesting that the team will remain “calm and confident” as votes come in – during what could potentially be a lengthy process.\n     \nEarly in the night on Tuesday: The Harris campaign expects “most of the results from Georgia and North Carolina” will come in relatively early, said O’Malley Dillon, noting that if those states are close “it might not be called until later.” The campaign also expects “near complete results” relatively early from Virginia, Florida, Ohio, and Colorado. At this point in the evening, the campaign is cautioning that “everyone should be very careful not to over-index on these results in any one state.”\n     \nBy the end of the night Tuesday: The Harris campaign expects “near-complete results” from Georgia, North Carolina, and Michigan, and “partial results” from Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Arizona.\n     \nBy Wednesday morning: The Harris campaign expects “most results” from Wisconsin by Wednesday morning, as well as “additional results from Pennsylvania and potentially Michigan,” O’Malley Dillon said.\n     \nOn Wednesday and beyond: The Harris campaign said additional results will be coming in “from Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada,” as well as a “small number of remaining ballots tabulated” in other battleground states.\n     \n            “Keep in mind that some ballots will continue to be counted for many days,” O’Malley Dillon cautioned.\n     \n            The executive director of North Carolina’s elections board pleaded with candidates to accept the results of the election at a news conference Monday.\n     \n            Karen Brinson Bell said this year her state has done more planning for possible threats than in past elections.\n     \n            “I would just make a plea to the candidates and election officials: Have a peaceful transition of power. Accept the results. Concede defeat, when necessary,”Brinson Bell said, adding that the election is administered by bipartisan community members who have sworn oaths to ensure that results are determined accurately.\n     \n            Brinson Bell said some election offices have installed panic buttons and further secured entrances ahead of the election.\n     \n            “I’ve worked in elections for nearly 19 years now, and post-election hostility, threats, harassment were not something that we planned for, for most of my career, but it certainly has become the case,” she said.\n     \n            She also referenced harassment and threats officials in Georgia, Arizona and Michigan and other battleground states faced after the 2020 election.\n     \n            “We have tried to learn from them, understand the relationships that we need to have with law enforcement,” Brinson Bell said. “What we’ve done is to prepare as best we can and consider it more of an insurance policy that we hope we never have to exercise.”\n     \n            Even with that added security, Brinson Bell said the state remains committed to transparency, and she invited people with questions to come and observe checks on tabulator systems and canvass meetings where results are presented to board members.\n     \n            “Understand why we are able to certify these elections,” she said.\n     \n            Shares of former President Donald Trump’s social media company roared higher on the final day before the US presidential election.\n     \n            Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), the parent company of Truth Social, surged 16% Monday. There was no apparent catalyst for the increase.\n     \n            The stock has been highly volatile since it went public in March: It quadrupled in value over a five-week span before plunging by 41% over the past three trading sessions.\n     \n            Traders have used Trump’s stock as a kind of barometer for the former president’s perceived reelection chances. The company’s shares do not trade on the fundamental health of the company’s business, which is minuscule by comparison with its better-known rivals such as X, TikTok and Instagram.\n     \n            Although polls show the presidential race remains extremely tight, online betting markets in recent weeks have given Trump the edge over Vice President Kamala Harris, and market analysts credit the Trump stock’s increase to the trend in prediction sites.\n     \n            Similarly, when Harris began to make a comeback in online betting markets, Trump’s media stock began to implode. The precipitous decline shaved $2.4 billion off Trump’s net worth between Wednesday and Friday, cutting deeply into the $3.6 billion in gains Trump made during the previous month.\n     \n            Monday’s gains added about a half billion dollars back to Trump’s net worth.\n     \n            At his final event in Michigan before Election Day, Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said a second Trump administration would protect the Michigan auto industry, while Vice President Harris would destroy it with electric vehicle mandates.\n     \n            He claimed that “when Kamala Harris talks about the electric vehicle mandate, you know that would destroy 117,000 Michigan auto worker jobs.”\n     \n        “When she attacks Donald J. Trump for wanting to impose tariffs to protect the Michigan auto industry, she’s telling you exactly who she’s going to fight for. She’s going to fight for electric vehicles made in communist China. We’re going to fight for Michigan auto workers and all of the middle-class families who depend on those jobs,” Vance said.\n     \n \n            As CNN’s Daniel Dale previously reported, the number of people employed in auto manufacturing in Michigan has increased by about 15% under the Biden-Harris administration; it is now at its highest level since 2007, though the number of people employed in auto parts manufacturing in the state has fallen about 6%.\n     \nAs Axios reported in September, Harris’ campaign would not say if she supports mandates on electric and hydrogen vehicles by 2035. The campaign has said she does not support a mandate on electric vehicles.\n     \nSome more context: United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain has emerged as a prominent backers and aggressive advocate of Harris, frequently slamming Trump’s labor policies and warning that second Trump administration would be damning to the movement.\n     \n            As Fulton County prepares for another Election Day under the microscope, several security procedures are in place to help secure the counting process, officials said Monday.\n     \n            Memory sticks from polling locations will arrive at the Fulton County elections hub with a police escort, officers will be in place at the elections hub 24 hours-a-day, and cameras will be recording various steps in the tabulation process (although those cameras will not be live-streamed).\n     \n            As the county prepares to tally ballots, it’s also grappling with legal challenges from the Republican National Committee over hundreds of absentee ballots that were hand-delivered over the weekend. Those ballots are being segregated amid pending litigation.\n     \n        “We get sued every day,” said Robb Pitts, chairman of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners. “We are prepared. There will be no basis for any challenge.”\n     \n \n            Officials said they will also remain vigilant about identifying possible misinformation, though they lamented that those efforts eat up election workers’ time and attention.\n     \n            “You asked if it takes away the time from the staff, and it does,” said Nadine Williams, director of registration and elections in Fulton County. “Unfortunately, that’s our biggest challenge is misinformation, to have to answer calls and emails about things that are not true.”\n     \n            The first wave of unofficial results of battleground Michigan could start coming in as early as Tuesday night, the Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson told reporters on Monday. The last polls will close at 9 p.m. ET.\n     \n            Those first numbers will include votes cast in person at early vote centers, she said, since those ballots were immediately put into tabulators, as well as from absentee ballots that have already been returned and tabulated, thanks to Michigan’s new law that allows for early tabulation. More than 80% of absentee ballots sent to voters have already been returned.\n     \n            Voters can still return their mail ballots to their local clerk’s office or a ballot drop box before 8 p.m. tomorrow. In-person, same-day voter registration is also an option for people showing up at polling places.\n     \n            She reminded reporters that in 2020, Michigan had 3.3 million citizens vote early and 2.2 million show up on Election Day, but clerks weren’t able to pre-process absentee ballots until 7 a.m. on Election Day. Clerks in Michigan’s larger municipalities were able to start processing and tabulating as early as a week ago.\n     \n            The secretary of state said she is “optimistic and hopeful” she would have results earlier than in 2020.\n     \n            Benson said based on the trends her office is seeing now, “we’re on pace to see another high turnout election” in Michigan. Nearly 3.2 million people have already voted, which amounts to about 44% of active registered voters. More than 1.2 million of those voters took advantage of the state’s new in-person early voting option.\n     \n            The FBI has established an election command post in Washington, DC, to monitor and respond to election-related threats in the lead-up to and after the election in coordination with state, local and federal partners.\n     \n            The office is staffed by 80 people per shift across a dozen agencies and will run 24-hours a day every day this week as election results come in.\n     \n            The office is not looking to curtail free speech or monitor social media, James Barnacle, deputy assistant director of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division, told reporters Monday during a walk-through of the command post.\n     \n            “However, when information is threatening, and it rises to the violation of federal laws, then we look to take action,” Barnacle said.\n     \n            Barnacle said that there has been a slight increase in threats reported to the center compared to past elections.\n     \n            “The threat reporting that we’re getting in here is a little more – not a huge volume increase,” Barnacle said. “People are more aware of reporting information to the FBI.”\n     \n            The threats, Barnacle said, include those to election workers, cyber threats and foreign malign influence campaigns, including from Russia, China and Iran as those countries are “looking to undermine democracy, sow discord and undermine Washington’s standing in the world.”\n     \n            The command post brings different experts together as well as law enforcement partners so that information around threats can quickly be disseminated to officers on the ground, Barnacle added. FBI offices across the country will all be running their own command posts this week as well, which will coordinate with the national command post in DC.\n     \n            Vice President Kamala Harris is working to present a vision of unity and togetherness as she rallies across Pennsylvania with less than a day to go until the election.\n     \n            “What you are all signing up to do today, and what you’ve been doing - like, let’s enjoy it, you know?” Harris said to people who will be canvasing on her behalf.\n     \n            Speaking near Scranton, she added: “We are a people-driven campaign, and we love the people and we see in the face of a stranger and neighbor, right? And that’s the spirit of what we are doing.”\n     \n            The event at Montage Mountain Resorts marks her first of five campaign events today. The vice president again avoided saying her Republican rival’s name, instead referring to Donald Trump as “the other guy.”\n     \n            “There’s a huge difference between me and the other guy, which everybody here knows, which is why you are here to help us get out the vote,” Harris said.\n     \n            The divisiveness in contemporary American politics, Harris said, “makes people feel alone.”\n     \n        “And so the way I’ve always been thinking about our campaign in these next 24 hours is, as we are getting out the vote, as we are canvassing, let’s be intentional about building community, about building community, about building coalitions, about reminding people we all have so much more in common than what separates us.”\n     \n \nThe post was updated with more of Harris’ remarks from Scranton, Pennsylvania\n \n            The mayor of Allentown, Pennsylvania, said that the Harris-Walz campaign’s ground game in the key battleground state “is what’s going to make the difference” this cycle, arguing that they seem to be outperforming the GOP.\n     \n        “We saw almost or over a million doors knocked in Pennsylvania over the past two days. Over the past weekend, I was here in Allentown on Saturday and Sunday, and saw hundreds of volunteers from across the country knocking on doors in Allentown,” Democratic Mayor Matthew Tuerk told CNN on Monday.\n     \n \n            He said volunteers were also knocking on voters’ doors in other areas of the sate, including along the route from Allentown to Philadelphia.\n     \n            Tuerk also predicted that comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s comments comparing Puerto Rico as “garbage” during former President Donald Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden will alienate voters — particularly in Allentown, with its significant Puerto Rican population.\n     \n            “I mean, people take it very seriously. It’s, it is a big deal, and it’s a big deal that angered a lot of people, and I think it motivated a lot of people to get off their couch and vote,” he said.\n     \n            However, Tuerk noted that voters in Allentown have been “waiting to hear from” Harris, as she’s traveled across much of Pennsylvania this cycle without stopping in the city.\n     \n            Harris is in Allentown on Monday, however. She holding a rally and concert this afternoon.\n     \n            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz touted the country’s elections systems as “the most secure elections in the world” while speaking to supporters in Wisconsin on Monday.\n     \n            He urged people in the room to cast their ballots and bring people in the community to vote tomorrow, pledging that Vice President Kamala Harris will “win on the votes” and touting the security of the country’s elections systems.\n     \n        “We have the fairest, the most secure elections in the world. We will count the votes. We will win on the votes, and we will be able to know that we had a part in not only moving on from nine years of what we’ve seen, but to charting truly a new way forward,” Walz said.\n     \n \n            Walz’s comments come as former President Donald Trump and his Republican allies have repeatedly claimed that election systems in various states are vulnerable to fraud.\n     \n            Walz rarely mentioned Trump while speaking in La Crosse, Wisconsin, appearing to follow Harris’ lead after she declined to mention him during her final campaign rally in Michigan on Sunday. Walz attacked “Donald Trump’s abortion ban” at one point and drew contrasts between Trump’s campaign and Harris’ vision for the country throughout his remarks without directly mentioning him.\n     \n            Walz also attacked Republicans broadly for not living up to their expressed values, including suggesting they want to “plaster” Trump’s face on the American flag.\n     \n            Vice President Kamala Harris is delivering remarks at an event near Scranton, Pennsylvania, ahead of polls closing tomorrow on Election Day.\n     \n            This is the first of her pre-Election Day rallies in the battleground state.\n     \n            She will be heading to Allentown, Reading and Pittsburgh before closing out the campaign with a rally in Philadelphia, where she will be joined by Oprah Winfrey and Lady Gaga, among other celebrities, musicians and elected officials.\n     \n            The presidential race is not the only high-stakes election happening in November. Voters will also be electing lawmakers for Congress and weighing in on key state races and ballot measures.\n     \n            Republicans are aiming to defend a narrow majority in the House of Representatives, where all 435 seats are up for grabs. In the Senate, 34 of the chamber’s 100 seats are on the ballot as Democrats look to defend a razor-thin majority.\n     \n            Eleven states are holding governor’s races, 5,808 state legislative seats are up and voters will vote on at least 153 ballot measures.\n \n            If the House flips from Republican to Democratic control and the Senate flips from Democratic to Republican control, it would be the first time in over 230 years of congressional elections that the two chambers of Congress changed partisan control in the opposite direction.\n     \n            With no clear leader in the presidential election, according to the most recent CNN nationwide poll, the battle for Congress will be crucial to determining whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump will have a supportive first branch of government to help implement the new president’s policies.\n     \n            In state legislatures, Republicans control both chambers in 28 states, while Democrats control both chambers in 20 states.\n     \n            And Colorado has the most ballot measures, with Arizona, California and New Mexico following behind.\n     \nCNN’s Matt Holt, Alex Leeds Matthews and Harry Enten contributed reporting.\n \n            At a rally in Michigan, Sen. JD Vance said leaders, including Vice President Kamala Harris, have “failed to do their job” on the economy for communities like Flint. He said that would change if Donald Trump is president.\n     \n            “We got to get out there tomorrow and take every single person you know,” Trump’s running mate said, encouraging supporters to make sure they turn out to the polls on Election Day.\n     \n            The Republican vice presidential candidate called Flint a “beautiful place to close out the campaign in Michigan.” He promised the crowd that he would come back to the state at the vice president.\n     \n            Vance said the campaign knows that middle-class people lost their jobs — specifically manufacturing jobs — and are struggling to afford things like groceries and claimed that was because “people like Kamala Harris failed to do their job.” He touted Trump’s record in office, making a pitch to voters that they were better off when he was president, pointing to the inflation rate and border security.\n     \n            “If we get back to the common sense policies of Donald J. Trump, we can get back to the peace and prosperity of that leadership,” he said, adding that he believes the country is “on the cusp of a golden age of American prosperity” that Trump could usher in.\n     \n            He slammed Harris’ economic proposals and said that the election is about “whether the American dream is going to be affordable for our fellow citizens.” Vance later claimed that Harris has not given specific answers about what she could do for Americans as president.\n     \n            He also tried to tie Harris to the Biden administration’s policies and argued that if she wanted to fix the “affordability crisis,” she would have already done it as vice president.\n     \n            “Stop talking about doing your job and go and do it,” Vance said.\n     \nRead about Harris’ and Trump’s proposals on the economy here. \n \nThis post has been updated with more of Vance’s remarks. \n \n            Republican vice presidential candidate JD is now delivering remarks at an event in Flint, Michigan, a key battleground state.\n     \n            He is expected to talk about things like the economy and inflation as well as the state’s auto industry, according to the campaign’s website.\n \nMichigan’s political landscape: Joe Biden flipped Michigan after Donald Trump won the state in 2016 as the first Republican to do since 1988. It is part of the the “blue wall” along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n     \n            Trump has made appeals to voters of color in areas like Detroit, especially Black and Latino men. These are groups Vice President Kamala Harris have been looking to turn out to the polls for her.\n     \n            Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz urged voters in Wisconsin to head to the polls on the eve of Election Day during a rally in La Crosse.\n     \n            “We are within 24 hours of polls opening. You could be anywhere, you came here because you love this country. And I’m grateful to each and every one of you for doing that,” Walz said. “The thing is upon us now, folks. I know that there’s a lot of anxiety, but the decisions that are made over the next 24 to 36 hours, when those polls close, will shape not just the next four years, they will shape the coming generations.”\n     \n            Walz went on to tout Vice President Kamala Harris’ vision for a unified America listing out her policy stances on the economy, health care and abortion rights.\n     \n        “It’s been 100 days, I could not be prouder to be on this ticket,” Walz said. \n     \n \n            He added, “When we win this thing — which we will — tomorrow, those are the values we will take to the White House.”\n     \n            Walz then “humbly” asked those in the crowd for their vote. “This election quite literally could be won through the state of Wisconsin.”\n     \n            Kamala Harris campaign officials are banking on what they’ve frequently called an aggressive ground game in Pennsylvania in the final hours of the presidential election, projecting optimism about their strategy in the key battleground state.\n     \n            “We’ve always been preparing for a close race since day one. We know Pennsylvania will be close, but we’re feeling really good about how we’re positioned going into Election Day,” Brendan McPhillips, a Harris campaign senior adviser for Pennsylvania, told CNN.\n     \n            Over the weekend, Harris campaign officials say their teams knocked on hundreds of thousands of doors across Pennsylvania.\n     \n            “We’re very precise about when we’re targeting people that we know where they’re coming from, we know where they stand, and we have a continuously evolving conversation with them throughout the course of the campaign,” McPhillips said, touting the get out the vote efforts on the ground and describing discussions on the ground as “overwhelmingly positive.”\n     \n            Many of the campaign’s strategies converged in Pennsylvania, including appealing to disaffected Republicans in red, rural counties, and courting Latino voters in Latino-dense areas like Reading, Pennsylvania.\n     \n            Monday’s stops across Pennsylvania are designed to target the diversity of the state, McPhillips said, in the campaign’s final push to convince voters who are still on the fence.\n     \n            The final pre-election NPR/PBS News/Marist poll, released Monday, finds Vice President Kamala Harris with a narrow lead over former President Donald Trump among likely voters nationally, 51% to 47%.\n     \n            The poll finds likely voters saying, 55% to 44%, that Trump is mainly making proposals he intends to carry out, rather than ones intended to get votes; by contrast, they’re split 49% to 49% on whether or not Harris really intends to carry out her proposals. Likely voters in the survey are about evenly split on which candidate can better handle the economy —50% say Trump, 49% Harris — and give Harris more positive personal ratings than Trump (50% rate her favorably, compared with 45% for Trump).\n     \n            With the results of the new poll incorporated, the latest CNN Poll of Polls average finds that an average of 49% of likely voters nationwide back Harris and 47% support Trump. Of the five surveys included, two show an edge for Harris, while three show no clear leader in the race.\n     \n            Pre-election voting is winding down across the country, with many states wrapping up in-person early voting over the weekend.\n     \n            More than 77 million ballots have already been cast in 47 states and the District of Columbia, according to data gathered by CNN, Edison Research and Catalist — a company that provides data, analytics and other services to Democrats, academics and nonprofit advocacy groups, including insights into who is voting before November.\n     \nHere are some of the key takeaways from early voting:\n \n            During his final rally in the battleground state of North Carolina, former president Donlad Trump called on his supporters to elect him in a “landslide that is too big to rig,” repeating baseless claims of election interference and seeding the ground to cast doubt on the outcome of the vote on Election Day.\n     \n            Trump called November 5 “the most important day in the history of our country” as he offered his closing argument in a presidential race that remains incredibly close, with polls showing Trump and Harris remain tied in many battleground states.\n     \n            Trump spoke for more than hour during the rally and renewed his promises to close the US border with Mexico.\n     \n            “We will not be invaded, we will be occupied, we will not be overrun, we will not be conquered,” Trump said. “We will be a free and proud nation once again. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope and the American dream itself.”\n     \n            Trump again called on his supporters to “fire Kamala.”\n     \n        “With your vote in this election you can show them once and for all that this nation does not belong to them, this nation belongs to you,” Trump said. “It is the hard working patriots like you who are going to save our country.”\n     \n \n            “Together, we will fight, fight, fight and win, win, win,” Trump said.\n     \n            Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz is delivering remarks at a rally in La Crosse, Wisconsin.\n     \n            The campaign event comes after Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance also held a rally in La Crosse earlier this morning.\n     \n            Both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have visited the state multiple times to court voters throughout the 2024 election cycle.\n     \n            Wisconsin is a key battleground state with 10 electoral college votes at stake. The state is a part of the “blue wall” along with Pennsylvania and Michigan. These states used to be more reliably Democratic but have shifted as their populations changed and as Trump has appealed to White voters without college degrees.\n     \n            In four of the last six presidential elections, Wisconsin has been decided by less than a percentage point on the presidential level.\n     \nCNN’s Ethan Cohen and Zachary B. Wolf contributed to this report.\n \n            Both presidential campaigns and their allies continued launching new TV ads heading into the final weekend of the White House race, underscoring the intense effort to get their closing message in front of voters. And in the home stretch, both candidates have produced lengthy, feature spots attempting to summarize their campaigns and deliver a final appeal.\n     \n            On Sunday afternoon, Harris’ campaign went up with a two-minute spot featuring the candidate speaking to the camera, recounting her experience on the campaign trail during a historic, condensed election, and pledging “to be a president for all Americans.”\n     \n            “Throughout this campaign, I’ve seen the best of America. And I’ve seen what is holding you back and weighing you down. High costs, fundamental rights taken away, and politics that have driven fear and division,” Harris says in the ad, cut with Americana imagery and video from campaign events. “You deserve better.”\n     \n            And the previous Sunday, the Trump campaign went up with its own two-minute feature ad, promoting Trump’s first-term record, and hailing his decision to run for president a third time – while featuring dramatic moments from the 2024 campaign, including footage of the first assassination attempt against the former president.\n     \n            Trump’s ad features narration from the candidate and several clips from his campaign events. “Our country has gone to hell. So I made a decision to run. We’re gonna make America great again, greater than ever before,” Trump says in the ad.\n     \n            Advertisers have spent more than $2.3 billion on the 15-week presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, a stunning ad blitz during which Democrats have outspent Republicans by a total of about $1.4 billion to $933 million.\n     \n            By comparison, during the final 15 weeks of the 2020 presidential election, advertisers ran a total of about $1.7 billion worth of advertising for the White House race, and Democrats led Republicans by about $1 billion to $631 million, according to data from the ad tracking firm AdImpact.\n     \n            In 2024, seven critical battleground states — Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada — account for roughly 80% of all the ad dollars spent during the period between Biden’s withdrawal and Election Day.\n     \n            And one battleground, Pennsylvania, accounts for roughly one-fifth of all the ad spending during the unprecedented campaign sprint, drawing more than half a billion dollars and looming as the top target for both parties.\n     \n            A Republican-tied super PAC is airing on Detroit radio a minute-long ad telling voters to support Green Party candidate Jill Stein over Vice President Kamala Harris’ support for Israel.\n     \n            The ad, uncovered by CNN through a search of ads running on local swing state radio stations, is just the latest effort of Badger Values PAC — a Republican-staffed organization that has been spending heavily in the last two weeks to boost Stein and former President Donald Trump in Michigan and Wisconsin.\n     \n            The ad is airing on at least two stations, WMGC and WMXD, both urban radio stations.\n     \n            The advertisement accuses Harris of “blindly supporting Israel” and then quotes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaking in Hebrew, saying “we will turn them into rubble” and “we will destroy them,” but does not include the context Netanyahu was speaking about Hamas the night of after the October 7, 2023 terrorist attack.\n     \n            It also quotes Harris in an interview with CNN earlier this year saying, “I am unequivocal and unwavering in my commitment to Israel’s defense and its ability to defend itself. And that’s not gonna change.”\n     \n            The group has now spent more than $1,803,417 in its efforts to boost Stein and Trump in the two states according to its latest filings with the FEC. Listen to the full ad, archived by CNN here.\n \n            Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance on Monday urged voters in Wisconsin to turn out in large numbers on Election Day now that early voting is done, during remarks in La Crosse.\n     \n            Vance noted that the campaign event today marks his last visit to Wisconsin before Election Day tomorrow. He promised to come back “as your vice president.”\n     \n            “We’re going to win this thing,” Vance said, noting that since early voting is over, tomorrow is  “our last chance.”\n     \n        Tomorrow is the last day. Tomorrow is the big day when we are going to vote in very big numbers in the state of Wisconsin. We’re going to vote for change. We’re going to vote for American prosperity. We’re going to vote for Donald J. Trump,” Vance said.\n     \n \n            Throughout his VP campaign, Vance has attempted to appeal to women voters through promising stronger public safety. In this rally, he aimed to undercut Harris by using criminal undocumented immigrants as an example.\n     \n            “Kamala Harris has the audacity to say that she stands for women and young girls. You know, the most important thing Kamala, if you want to stand for women and young girls is you want to make our communities safe enough for women and young girls to be able to walk down the street without being sexually assaulted by a criminal that you let into this country,” Vance said.\n     \n            Continuing to slam Harris on immigration, Vance said the southern border is where her policies “have worked the worst,” and where Trump’s policies “worked the best.”\n     \n            Election officials in Lincoln, Nebraska, are debunking a video that claims to show a young man illegally putting other people’s ballots into a drop box outside a library, saying the false claim may have put the young voter in danger.\n     \n            The Lancaster County election commissioner says the video, which a poster on X claimed to show a “ballot mule,” actually shows “a young man returning his ballot for the first Presidential Election.”\n     \n            After using surveillance video to identify the voter, the matter was referred to the Lincoln Police Department because “commenters on the social media posts were threatening to harm him,” commissioner Todd Wiltgen said in a written statement.\n     PRESS RELEASE: Election Commissioner Responds to False and Misleading Social Media PostReplies have been disabled on this post. pic.twitter.com/KBmB1x4BEk \n            The Lancaster County Republican Party also took to social media, encouraging people not to spread the rumor.\n     \n            “Everyone Calm down this is CONFIRMED to be a young man returning his ballot for his first ever presidential election,” the local party posted on its X account.\n     \n            At a campaign stop in Raleigh, North Carolina, Donald Trump urged his supporters to get out and cast their ballots to “fire” Vice President Kamala Harris.\n     \n            “Tomorrow, you have to stand up and tell Kamala that you’ve had enough, you can’t take anymore, you just can’t,” Trump said.\n     \n        “You’re going to say, ‘You’ve done a terrible job, you’re grossly incompetent, we’re not going to take it anymore. Kamala, you’re fired! Get the hell out. Get the hell out of here,’” Trump said.\n     \n \n            On the eve of the election, the former president told his supporters he has multiple campaign stops and that his voice is “holding up, I think, about barely.”  But, Trump said North Carolina voters have reliably supported him, and he’s never lost the state.\n     \n            “I don’t think we’re going to start now,” the former president said.\n     \n            During the rally, Trump brought Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio on stage.\n     \n            Rubio told the crowd the country has suffered from a “malaise” under the Biden-Harris administration. He urged voters to elect Trump and make him the 47th president of the United States.\n     \n            “Together with Donald Trump, we are going to make America not just great, but greater than it has ever been before,” Rubio said to cheers of “USA.”\n     \n            Lawyers for Elon Musk argued in court Monday that his $1 million giveaway to voters isn’t a lottery and said the super PAC isn’t picking winners “by chance.”\n     \n            “There is no prize to be won,” Musk lawyer Chris Gober said, and the winners “are not chosen by chance.”\n     \n        Instead, Gober said the so-called “prize” is actually compensation for serving as a spokesperson for Musk’s pro-Trump super PAC – and the recipients of the $1 million “are selected based on their suitability to serve as spokesperson for America PAC.” They “earn” the million dollars as payment for their work.\n     \n \n            In announcing the giveaway, Musk said: “We are going to be awarding $1 million randomly to people who have signed the petition,” referring to his petition in support of the Constitution. But Gober argued Monday that there is a difference between “randomly” choosing winners and picking them “by chance,” as happens in a lottery.\n     \n            The judge is weighing whether to shut down the sweepstakes because, the district attorney contents, it is operating as an unlawful lottery outside the rules of state gaming laws.\n     \n            A lawyer for the Philadelphia district attorney, John Summers, said in response that this argument was “a complete admission of liability” and “a flat-out admission of liability.” Part of the district attorney’s argument in his original lawsuit filed last week was that the sweepstakes winners were not being selected at random.\n     \n            Musk’s super PAC adopted this framing – that the sweepstakes winners are getting paid to serve as spokespeople – shortly after launching the sweepstakes and attracting significant legal scrutiny.\n     \nCorrection: An earlier version of this post used the wrong first name for the Philadelphia district attorney’s lawyer. It is John.\n \n            Former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney said that she was proud to cast her vote for Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov Tim Walz.\n     \n            During an interview on ABC’s “The View,” Cheney said she believes many of her fellow Republicans are crossing the aisle to vote for Harris this election.\n     \n        “It’s not about partisan politics. It’s about the future of our country,” Cheney said. \n     \n \n            Cheney also said that there is only one “responsible adult” in the race and that voters do not have the luxury of writing in someone. “We have to defeat him,” she said referring to former President Donald Trump.\n     \n            “I can’t tell you how proud I was to fill in that, you know, circle next to Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,” Cheney said. It’s Cheney’s first time voting for a Democrat.\n     \n            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz kicked off his last day of campaigning before Election Day with a celebratory send off in his hometown of Minneapolis with dozens of supporters, including high-ranking Minnesota Democratic allies.\n     \n            Before setting off on his final set of campaign events in Wisconsin and Michigan on Monday, Walz thanked supporters on the runway at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. Among those in attendance were Minnesota Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, Minnesota Rep. Betty McCollum, Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter.\n     \n            As Walz arrived, along with Minnesota First Lady Gwen Walz and their daughter Hope, the crowd cheered on the tarmac as his walkup song, “Small Town” by John Mellencamp, played on speakers. Walz greeted supporters on the tarmac for several minutes before boarding the Harris-Walz branded campaign plane en route to Wisconsin for his first campaign stop of the day.\n     \n            On the eve of Election Day, celebrity guests and performers will campaign across the battleground states. Here’s who the Harris campaign says will be performing and delivering remarks today:\n     \nLas Vegas\n \n            • Who’s performing? Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and Sofi Tukker with remarks from Eva Longoria\n     \nPennsylva﻿nia\n \n            Vice President Kamala Harris is spending the entire day in Pennsylvania and headlining these two events:\n     \n            • Pittsburgh: Who’s performing? D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day\n     \n            • Philadelphia: Who’s attending? DJ Cassidy, Fat Joe, Freeway and Just Blaze, Lady Gaga, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Ricky Martin, The Roots, Jazmine Sullivan and Adam Blackstone, and Oprah Winfrey\n     \nPhoenix, Arizona\n \n            • Who’s performing? La Original Banda El Limón\n     \nDetroit, Michigan\n \n            Gov. Tim Walz will be headlining this event.\n     \n            • Who’s performing? Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi and The War and Treaty\n     \nMilwaukee, Wisconsin\n \n            Walz is also headlining this rally.\n     \n            • Who’s performing? Eric Benét\n     \nRaleigh, North Carolina\n \n            • Who’s performing? Fantasia Barrino, James Taylor, Remi Wolf, and Sugarland\n     \nAtlanta, Georgia\n \n            • Who’s performing? 2 Chainz, F.L.Y., Joy of Jesse & Joy, Keyshia Cole, KP The Great, Morehouse House of Funk Marching Band, Pastor Troy and Tamar Braxton\n     \n            In his final campaign rally in battleground North Carolina, former President Donald Trump urged his supporters to help him close out the 2024 election cycle and win the White House.\n     \n        “Hopefully everything will work out well, we’re way leading, all we have to do is close it out,” Trump said. “If we get everybody out and vote there’s not a thing they can do.”\n     \n \n            Trump began his final rally in the battleground state by discussing polls, which he said show him leading. Trump said he’s visiting North Carolina on the eve of the election to urge people to “get out and vote.”\n     \n            Last week, CNN reported on the latest poll out of North Carolina, where Harris stood at 48% to Trump’s 47% among likely voters. The results were within the margin of error in the state, suggesting no clear leader in the contest.\n     \n            Before the former president took the stage, his son, Donald Trump, Jr., asked those of his father’s supporters who voted early in the state to spend the day urging their friends and family to go to the polls and “take back your country.”\n     \n            “Get in line, bring your friends, stay in line,” Trump, Jr., said.\n     \n            Former President Donald Trump is speaking in Raleigh, North Carolina, as he makes his final push in a battleground state that was key to his campaign in 2020.\n     \n            Trump is campaigning in the state for the third day in a row as he tries to rally voters on the eve of the election.\n     \n            Prior to Trump taking the stage, Alina Habba and Donald Trump Jr. addressed the audience.\n     \n            Susie Wiles, Eric Trump and Michael Whatley are waiting in the wings while Trump is on stage — it is unclear if they will speak.\n     \n            Marco Rubio and Sarah Huckabee Sanders were expected to give remarks before Trump came on, per Trump campaign, but they did not speak.\n     \n            Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance is delivering remarks at a rally in La Crosse, Wisconsin.\n     \n            Wisconsin is a key battleground state with 10 electoral college votes at stake. The state is a part of the “blue wall” along with Pennsylvania and Michigan.\n     \n            The states used to be more reliably Democratic but have shifted as their populations changed and as former President Donald Trump has appealed to White voters without a college degree.\n     \n            Both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have visited the state multiple times to court voters throughout the 2024 election cycle. In four of the last six presidential elections, Wisconsin has been decided by less than a percentage point on the presidential level.\n     \nCNN’s Ethan Cohen and Zachary B. Wolf contributed to this report.\n \n            A court hearing on whether to shut down Elon Musk’s $1 million giveaway to registered voters is underway in Philadelphia.\n     \n            Regardless of the outcome of the hearing, Musk’s sweepstakes is set to end on Tuesday, which is Election Day. Musk and his pro-Trump super PAC have given out $16 million over the past two weeks to registered voters in battleground states – despite the legal scrutiny.\n     \n            Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, a progressive Democrat, filed a lawsuit to shut down Musk’s sweepstakes, claiming it violates state gaming laws and threatens the integrity of the 2024 election.\n     \n            Musk’s lawyers have countered that this is a partisan lawsuit filed to “silence” Musk’s pro-Trump advocacy. Chris Gober, treasurer of Elon Musk’s pro-Trump super PAC, slammed the Philadelphia DA on Monday before the hearing.\n     \n            “We’re in court today because some district attorney in Philadelphia wants to silence Elon Musk for supporting Donald Trump,” Gober said.\n     \n            “We don’t back down from bullies. We don’t allow our rights to be trampled upon by partisan agendas masquerading as legal arguments,” he added.\n     \n            Last week, a federal judge rejected Musk’s request to move the case to federal court.\n     \n            Vice President Kamala Harris in an interview released on Monday described her commitment to Puerto Rico as “long-standing” and reiterated her campaign pledge to build an “opportunity economy” during a pre-taped radio interview with Univision Radio’s Spanish-language program “El Bueno La Mala y El Feo.”\n     \n        “Even when I was in the United States Senate as a representative of California, I took on a responsibility for myself of also prioritizing the needs of Puerto Rico, because I was aware that Puerto Rico did not have a US senator, and so I was responsible for getting more resources to Puerto Rico,” Harris said when asked what she thought of the comments made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe at former President Donald Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden.\n     \n \n            She also discussed increasing economic opportunity in Puerto Rico and updating the US territory’s faltering electric grid.\n     \n            “My vision of the economy for growth is what I call an opportunity economy, understanding that everyone has ambition, they have hard work ethic, they have the skills, but not always the access to the resources to achieve their goals and their dreams,” Harris said, discussing her goals of home ownership, small business loans and child tax credits. Harris spoke in English, and her remarks were translated.\n     \n            By almost every measure, the way former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have closed their campaigns for the White House could not present more of a contrast as they make final appeals to voters in a race that remains on a razor’s edge heading into Election Day.\n     \n            The last full day of campaigning also speaks to the contrasting approaches for the two candidates, with Harris focused on a single state that could hold the key to her pathway to victory while Trump visits three states as he eyes multiple avenues that could lead him back to the White House.\n     \nContrasting closing messages\n \n            In one of his final pitches to Pennsylvania voters, Trump promoted unfounded claims about Democrats cheating in the 2024 election, asserted that he “shouldn’t have left” the White House after his 2020 defeat and suggested he would not mind if a gunman were to “shoot through the fake news” to get to him and lashed out at an Iowa poll showing him in a close race in a state he won twice. The overall message and mood from Trump highlights how he has embraced dark rhetoric, vulgar attacks and baseless conspiracies as cornerstones of closing argument instead of drawing a contrast with his Democratic rival on policy areas where polls still show him with advantages among voters.\n     \n            By contrast, the vice president avoided any mention of Trump in her final pitch to Michigan voters on Sunday, instead anchoring her message around a call to “turn the page on a decade of politics driven by fear and division.” The emphasis on “a new way forward” offered a clear contrast by Harris without amplifying her more direct appeal in recent days of presenting the election as a choice between a president who will focus on a “to-do list” for the American people and another who would be guided by an “enemies list.”\n     \nDueling events on the trail\n \n            Harris is set to hold five events across Pennsylvania on Monday, beginning with a canvass kickoff in Scranton. She will follow that with stops in Reading, Allentown and Pittsburgh before closing out the campaign with a rally in Philadelphia, where she will be joined by Oprah Winfrey and Lady Gaga, among other celebrities, musicians and elected officials.\n     \n            Trump begins his day with a rally in North Carolina — the state that gave him his narrowest win in 2020 and one his Democratic rival is eager to flip. It marks the third consecutive day the former president is spending in the Tar Heel State, one that is crucial to his electoral map. From there, Trump travels to Pennsylvania for a pair of events in in Reading and Pittsburgh.\n     \n            The dueling events in Pittsburgh and Reading — the Pennsylvania city with the highest percentage of Latino residents — speak to the importance of that voting bloc in the commonwealth — and how the state is poised to play a decisive role in determining which candidate emerges as the country’s next president.\n     \n            The GOP nominee will hold his final rally of the 2024 campaign the way he ended his previous two presidential runs — in Grand Rapids, Michigan — a nod to Trump’s superstitious tendencies. It is worth noting that Harris also is closing out her 2024 run in the same city she held her final rally during the 2020 campaign as Joe Biden’s running mate.\n     \n            Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday declined to say how she voted on Proposition 36, a California ballot initiative that would allow for increased sentencing for people convicted of retail theft or drug crimes.\n     \n        “I am not going to talk about the vote on that because honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election, and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or another around it,” she told reporters in Detroit when asked about the proposition.\n     \n \n            Harris, a former California attorney general and San Francisco district attorney, was speaking about casting her vote, saying, “I actually just filled out my mail-in ballot” and sent it to California, her home state.\n     \nProposition 36 would increase the punishment of certain theft and drug crimes by recategorizing them as felonies rather than misdemeanors. It would also require courts to warn people who sell illegal substances that they could be charged with murder if the substance kills someone.\n     \n            The measure would change parts of Proposition 47, a controversial initiative approved by California voters in 2014 to reduce overcrowding in jails by reducing punishments for some crimes.\n     \nRead more about what opponents of the proposal say here.\n \n            As both presidential candidates near the finish line, they will spend a final full day of campaigning on Monday — and will overlap in two places. Here’s where they are going:\n     \nVice President Kamala Harris:\n \nFormer President Donald Trump:\n \nSen. JD Vance:\n \nGov. Tim Walz:\n \n            Election Day is nearly upon us, and already more than 75 million Americans have cast their vote.\n     \n            If you’re planning on voting in person tomorrow there are a few things you should know, including what ID you need to take to the polls, what time they open and how to find your nearest polling location.\n     \n            CNN has collected all that information for you, simply choose your state from the list in the 2024 voter handbook here.\n \n            The winner of the 2024 presidential race will probably not be called on election night, especially given how close the margins are in key battleground states this cycle.\n     \n            CNN’s Director of Polling and Election Analytics Jennifer Agiesta breaks down why the way some states count votes can stretch Election Day into Election Week.\n     Ever wonder why it can take so long to know who won? CNN’s Director of Polling and Election Analytics Jennifer Agiesta explains why the way some states count votes can stretch Election Day into Election Week. #cnn #cnnnews \n            In the run up to the high-stakes 2024 presidential election, Elon Musk has posted a blizzard of false and misleading claims about the election on his social media platform that have generated more than two billion views this year, according to new research analysis from a nonprofit that tracks misinformation.\n     \n            Musk, the billionaire X owner who endorsed former President Donald Trump in July, has emerged as a leading figure in US politics, in addition to his longstanding reputation as an enterprising science leader at Tesla and SpaceX. He has given more than $118 million to a pro-Trump super PAC and hit the campaign trail to stump for Trump in Pennsylvania.\n     \n            On his social media platform, Musk has posted a seemingly endless stream of political messages, many in support of Trump and far-right political narratives, generating more than 17.1 billion views since the July endorsement, according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). The enormous megaphone would cost a political campaign about $24 million to reach the same audience on the site, the group said.\n     \n            CCDH’s research is based on an analysis of publicly available data from X about Musk’s own posts and spending by political campaigns to promote ads on the platform. The nonprofit tallied up how many views Musk received on 87 specific posts that contained false claims about the 2024 election that were debunked by fact-checkers. CNN has knocked down many of these bogus and distorted claims as well, including Musk’s baseless assertion that undocumented immigrants are voting en masse in US elections for Democrats.\n     \n            Read more about the new data that shows how Musk has used the platform to repeat false claims here.\n     \n            Former President Donald Trump and one of his most vocal supporters, tech billionaire Elon Musk, have alleged without evidence that the potential for voter fraud is a major threat.\n     \n            Voting is ultimately an act of faith in democracy, and undercutting the system, despite all the evidence to the contrary, is clearly a strategy on the part of Trump’s allies.\n     \n            To better understand the security of US voting systems and why there’s no indication that they’re not secure, I talked to CNN’s Zachary Cohen, who covers national security, and Sean Lyngaas, who covers cybersecurity. They’re both part of a larger team of reporters at CNN who are focused on election security. Our conversation was edited for clarity. Here’s an excerpt of our conversation:\n     \nWOLF: How does the process of voting generally work with these systems?\n \nLYNGAAS: You have different equipment that handles the voter registration database, so when you show up on voting day or whenever you go to vote, they can compare what’s in that voter registration to what’s in front of them in terms of their records.\n     \n            About 97% of votes are cast with a paper record. Federal officials, election officials are using that as a point of reference to try to convince people that their vote is secure and accurate, which it is.\n     \n            Voting machines – some are a touch tablet where you have a panel, and you make your choice and print that out. In other systems, a voter fills out the ballot with a pen and then feeds it into a voting machine.\n     \nCOHEN: There’s a common misconception that the voting machines are the complete process. In reality, they’re one part of a bigger system that goes into casting, then storing and counting votes. In a lot of states, a county will transfer the data they get from the machines themselves via USB and go manually plug that into a computer.\n     \n            All that data is then gathered and collected online by the secretary of states or by whoever is in charge, ultimately, of preserving that data. Then there is obviously the paper ballot part of it, which is more about reassuring the voter, but also can be used as an audit tool as well.\n     \nRead more about how the voting systems work here.\n \n            Vice President Kamala Harris will spend today crisscrossing Pennsylvania, making her final pitch to the swing state voters.\n     \n            Harris starts the day in Scranton delivering remarks and participating in a canvass kickoff.\n     \n            She then rallies in Allentown, a majority Latino city that her campaign highlighted is home to 34,000 Puerto Ricans. Rapper Fat Joe will join the vice president.\n     \n            Following the stop in Allentown, Harris heads to Reading where she will make a stop at a Puerto Rican restaurant with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.\n     \n            Harris, joined by her husband Doug Emhoff, then heads west to Pittsburgh where she will hold a rally and concert in the evening. DJ D-Nice, Katy Perry, and Andra Day are expected to perform.\n     \n            The vice president finishes the day in Philadelphia, which her campaign called the birthplace of American democracy. In the state’s largest city, Harris will hold a rally and concert at the famous “Rocky Steps” at the Philadelphia Museum of the Arts.\n     \n            DJ Cassidy, Fat Joe, Freeway and Just Blaze, Lady Gaga, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Ricky Martin, The Roots, Jazmine Sullivan and Adam Blackstone, and Oprah Winfrey are expected to perform or speak.\n     \n            The final swing through the Keystone State marks the 18th trip to Pennsylvania for Harris since launching her campaign in July.\n     \n            If you’re inclined to roll your eyes at the stuffy academics shouting about the damage tariffs do to the economy, I get it. “Tariff” is just one of those words that makes your eyelids feel as heavy as they did in your 9 a.m. undergraduate econ class.\n     \n            But if you don’t want to heed the many, many economists’ warnings about former President Trump’s fringe economic plans, take it from the people running the companies that make the stuff you buy: Prices will go up. How much and how fast is hard to know, but you can bet your bottom dollar you’ll be needing more dollars to pay for everyday goods if Trump’s sweeping tariffs are put in place.\n     \n        “If we get tariffs, we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer,” said Philip Daniele, CEO of AutoZone, on an earnings call in September.\n     \n \n            AutoZone also won’t need to wait until the policies are enacted, Daniele noted. Once they know what the markup will be, “we generally raise prices ahead of that.”\n     \nA quick primer on tariffs: They’re a tax on imported goods — clothes, shoes, toys, car parts, appliances, you name it. But the extra money does not come from the foreign companies that produce those goods. The American company doing the importing pays the money to the US Treasury. And more often than not, that means you, the consumer, pay for the tariff.\n     \n            This isn’t speculation or theory, it’s just the way tariffs work — and we have the last six years of global trade to prove it.\n     \nRead more about the impact the tariff’s would have on your wallet here.\n \n            While most of the nation’s attention is focused on the top of the ticket, Democrats and Republicans are engaged in an equally fierce battle for control of key state legislatures, including several in presidential swing states.\n     \n            In addition to the Arizona Legislature, Democrats are hoping to flip the New Hampshire Legislature, make inroads in the Wisconsin House and chip away at Republican supermajorities, including those in the North Carolina and Kansas legislatures and the Wisconsin Senate.\n     \n            Republicans, meanwhile, are focused on protecting those majorities, as well as targeting narrow Democratic majorities in the state Houses in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Minnesota.\n     \n            Chaz Nuttycombe, the director of cnalysis.com, which forecasts state legislative races, said Democrats are likely to gain seats nationally this year due to new, more competitive district lines. But on a map full of tight races, particularly in swing states, there’s a chance Republicans could exceed expectations.\n     \n            “There’s plenty of room for upset, for Republicans to defy those odds and somehow — despite redistricting and 2024 being a bluer environment, most likely, than 2022 … gain seats in state legislatures this year,” he said.\n     \n            For Democrats, this cycle is part of a yearslong campaign to gain back power at the state level after the 2010 election cycle, when Republicans flipped control of 22 state chambers and gained the upper hand in redistricting.\n     \nRead more about the Democratic effort to win over state legislatures here. \n \n            Eugene Vindman, the Democratic candidate for Virginia’s 7th Congressional District said the US has a choice between “whether we go down a dark path, a path where this country has seen its best days or a bright future where we have joy and hope and optimism for what we can achieve together,” speaking to CNN’s Kasie Hunt.\n     \n            Vindman said he was focused on positivity heading into the election and had a “optimistic, joyful” message.\n     \n        “I’m an optimist by nature… My family came here when I was an immigrant fleeing from the Soviet Union. We’ve been able to build a future for ourselves, my wife and my two wonderful children that I’m raising in northern Virginia and that’s the future I want to preserve for my children and for all Americans,” he said.\n     \n \nHouse race to watch on election night: The candidate is in a battle with Republican Derrick Anderson for the seat, which will be one of the most closely watched races early in the night Tuesday. The district, which stretches from the Washington suburbs to the rolling hills of the commonwealth’s Piedmont region, would have backed Biden under the current lines by about 7 points in 2020.\n     \n            Vindman said there was “work to do” in the area, but his campaign was focussing on ensuring “safe, high quality public schools,” and improving infrastructure across the region.\n     \n            The other Virginia race to watch is the coastal 2nd District, anchored by Virginia Beach, where GOP Rep. Jen Kiggans is facing off against fellow Navy veteran Missy Cotter Smasal. If either party were to capture both races, that could foreshadow a favorable environment.\n     \nCNN’s Terence Burlij contributed reporting.\n \n            On the last day of the presidential campaign, the massive stakes of the election are heightened by the sense that no one can possibly say who will win.\n     \nIf Donald Trump wins on Tuesday, he will be only the second defeated president to win a nonconsecutive term. He will complete one of the most staggering political comebacks ever after trying to torch democracy to stay in power after the 2020 election, being convicted of a crime and escaping two attempts on his life this year.\n     \nIf Kamala Harris wins, she could shatter the line of nearly 250 years of male commanders in chief and become the first woman president. It would be a stunning feat after she unified the demoralized Democratic Party in July when President Joe Biden’s reelection bid was destroyed by the ravages of age.\n     \nRead the full analysis.\n \n            With Election Day closing in, we look back at the unprecedented events that have shaped the US presidential race.\n     \n            On a recent evening, Democratic state Rep. Judy Schwiebert went canvassing in a north Phoenix neighborhood where yards were adorned with Halloween decorations and Trump campaign signs.\n     \n            When Schwiebert, who is running for a Republican-held state Senate seat, knocks on doors, she introduces herself as a former teacher, asks whether residents have already voted and emphasizes her support for funding public schools.\n     \n            Only sometimes does the second-term state representative lean into what her election could mean for Arizona: Democrats need a net gain of two state House seats and two state Senate seats to gain a trifecta for the first time in more than 60 years.\n     \nSome context: While most of the nation’s attention is focused on the top of the ticket, Democrats and Republicans are engaged in an equally fierce battle for control of key state legislatures, including several in presidential swing states.\n     \n            In addition to the Arizona Legislature, Democrats are hoping to flip the New Hampshire Legislature, make inroads in the Wisconsin House and chip away at Republican supermajorities, including those in the North Carolina and Kansas legislatures and the Wisconsin Senate.\n     \n            Republicans, meanwhile, are focused on protecting those majorities, as well as targeting narrow Democratic majorities in the state Houses in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Minnesota.\n     \n            For Democrats, this cycle is part of a yearslong campaign to gain back power at the state level after the 2010 election cycle, when Republicans flipped control of 22 state chambers and gained the upper hand in redistricting.\n     \nRead the full story.\n \n            Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell’s potential successors have been crisscrossing the country, cozying up to former President Donald Trump and barnstorming battleground states in the final days of the election to help their party win back the Senate — and help themselves, too.\n     \nSen. John Cornyn and Senate GOP Whip John Thune, the two top candidates to succeed McConnell, have been pouring millions into GOP candidates’ campaign accounts and stumping for them on the trail — part of an effort to lock up support when the secret-ballot leadership election takes place on November 13. GOP senators and top aides say the race could go either way.\n     \nA major wild card: The fallout from the presidential election that takes place the week before and the role that Trump will play in trying to anoint a leader if he wins. Yet if Trump loses, Thune and Cornyn will have to make their case on how the GOP can dig out of the political wilderness, arguments that senators say could carry great weight as they cast their secret ballots.\n     \n            Nevertheless, both Cornyn and Thune recognize Trump’s potential sway, especially with a faction of the GOP conference, and have been zeroing in on bolstering their ties with the former president over the last several months.\n     \n            A third candidate, Sen. Rick Scott, who is seen by senators as a long-shot in the race, has also been in regular contact with Trump in their home state of Florida, but has been consumed with his own reelection campaign this fall. Scott, who is a McConnell critic, has been more willing to fall in line with Trump than Cornyn or Thune over the last several years.\n     \nRead the full story.\n \n            Warm water in the Gulf of Mexico that was predicted by climate scientists to feed harsher hurricanes helped supercharge September’s Hurricane Helene. That was before October’s monster storm, Milton, struck killing 24 people.\n     \n            The science suggests Americans need to get used to more harsh weather events — extreme storms, warmer waters, wildfires and hotter weather. Evacuations and destruction will become more normal.\n     \n            But climate change, to the extent people are talking about it, did not register this year as an “extremely important” presidential campaign issue.\n     \n            In Gallup polling from late September, most of which was conducted just before Helene made landfall, registered voters were asked to rate the importance of 22 issues in this year’s election.\n     \n            Just 5% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, along with slightly more than a third of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, said climate change was “extremely” important to their vote.\n     \n            Climate change and transgender rights were the only two of the 22 issues listed by Gallup that half or fewer of respondents said were either “extremely” or “very” important to their presidential vote choice at the time.\n     \nRead more on Kamala Harris’ and Donald Trump’s positions on climate change.\n \n            The deep mistrust between conservatives and Republican election officials in Georgia is hampering efforts to slow the tide of election misinformation in the pivotal battleground state.\n     \n            When Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger warned a video of immigrants voting with multiple IDs was fake and likely a Russian disinformation effort — an assessment backed up by US intelligence agencies — Republican skeptics were unmoved.\n     \n            Kylie Jane Kremer, a Trump backer who helped organize the January 6, 2021, rally on the Ellipse, posted on social media that if Raffensperger and another top official in the office, Gabriel Sterling, said it was false, “I don’t believe them.”\n     \n            After US intelligence agencies confirmed what state officials had suspected, she started reposting criticisms of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\n     \n            While the most pointed criticism is often directed at Raffensperger — who refused to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election despite a direct plea from then-President Donald Trump — and his staff, the skepticism of local election officials underscores one of the key challenges in trying to debunk misinformation this election.\n     \n            The best sources of accurate and timely election information have been state and election officials. But plenty of conservatives simply don’t believe what election officials are sharing, even when it is backed up by other sources.\n     \nRead the full story.\n \n            The final Iowa poll released this weekend showed Kamala Harris slightly ahead of former President Donald Trump — in a state he had previously carried — partly thanks to support among women for the vice president, highlighting the role that gender has played in this election.\n     \n            This gender gap has been seen in other states too, said Sara Sadhwani, an assistant professor of politics at Pomona College.\n     \n            But, she said, that gender gap breaks along lines of educational attainment — meaning women with college degrees tend to support Harris more, while both men and women without college degrees lean the other way.\n     \n            And these women could have a strong influence on the election as they tend to be a more reliable voting bloc, she added. While Trump enjoys the support of many young men, that demographic isn’t always reliable — meaning they may not actually turn out to vote, perhaps because “they don’t always see the outcome of an election as being something that’s actually going to benefit them in the future,” Sadwhani told CNN’s Rosemary Church on Monday.\n     \n            Immigrant communities and people of color also play a significant role, Sadwhani said. She pointed to Pennsylvania, where there are about 100,000 Indian American voters, and a large proportion of Puerto Rican Americans — who could potentially be swayed toward Harris after the offensive joke against Puerto Rico made recently at a Trump rally.\n     \n        “Particularly just in the last several weeks, Donald Trump has gone on a rampage … castigating immigrant communities and stereotyping them, in ways that certainly doesn’t always sit well with many of these communities,” she said.\n     \n \n            Presidential historian and professor Allan Lichtman has correctly predicted the outcome of nine of the last 10 presidential elections. And this year, he predicts Vice President Kamala Harris will win.\n     \n            His system, which is called “The Keys to the White House,” runs through 13 metrics on a checklist to calculate the final prediction, disregarding the polls used in the run-up to an election.\n     \n        “Why am I sure that Harris is going to win? Because it’s only close on the polls, and my system ignores the polls,” Lichtman told CNN’s Rosemary Church on Monday.\n     \n \n            He said that these polls are often just “snapshots” with large margins of error, and that “people don’t respond to pollsters, they lie, they change their minds, and they have to guess who the likely voters are.”\n     \n            Lichtman was one of the few who correctly predicted Donald Trump would win the 2016 election — which “did not make me very popular” at the time, he recalled.\n     \n            His 13-point system, each answered with either a “yes” or “no,” takes into consideration a number of factors and circumstances — such as whether there has been social unrest during the previous presidential term, whether the economy is in recession, and whether the incumbent has faced major scandal during their term.\n     \n            Even though he’s confident in his prediction, Lichtman said he was nervous — partly because of the unprecedented amount of harassment and “hate” that he and his family have received, and partly because “democracy is really on the ballot here.”\n     \n        “Democracy is precious. But like all precious things, it can be destroyed,” he said. “We’ve never had a candidate before who’s impeded the peaceful transfer of power, instigated a violent coup, orchestrated fake electors and has now refused accept the results of a fair election.”\n     \n \n            “I don’t care so much whether I’m right or wrong, I care about the future of our country, which is in grave jeopardy.”\n     \n            There are thought to be seven states that could conceivably be won by either candidate. As a result, the campaigns of Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have focused their energy in these areas.\n     \n            They can be broken up into two general categories:\n     \n3 Midwestern battlegrounds, aka “the blue wall” — These are the manufacturing and union-heavy states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. They used to be more reliably Democratic but have shifted as their populations changed and as Trump has appealed to White voters without a college degree.\n     \n            When Trump won the White House in 2016, he won all three. When Joe Biden won in 2020, he won all three. If Harris wins all three this year, she will likely have the electoral votes to be president. But polls suggest close races in all three. Turnout will be key, which for Harris means appealing to suburban women and Black voters.\n     \n            The blue wall states usually vote the same way. The last time they did not all go to the same candidate was in 1988 — notably also a year when California was red and West Virginia was blue. In those eight elections since 1988, the only time the blue wall states went to a Republican was in 2016, when they were won by Trump.\n     \n4 Sun Belt battlegrounds — These states with growing populations include Arizona and Nevada in the West and North Carolina and Georgia in the East. Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina used to be more reliably Republican. Trump won North Carolina twice, but the margins were close in 2020. The last Democrat to win there was Barack Obama in 2008. Biden was the first Democrat to win Georgia since Bill Clinton in 1992 and Arizona since Clinton in 1996.\n     \n1 vote in Nebraska is a battleground — 48 states award all their electoral votes to the victor. Nebraska and Maine do it differently, awarding votes by congressional district. The state of Nebraska is safe Trump territory, but the congressional district around Omaha is a battleground. That one vote could end up being crucial in the event of a close race in the Electoral College.\n     \n            Note: It’s the reverse situation in Maine, the only other state that does not award all of its electors to the statewide winner. Trump could pick up a single electoral vote in Maine.\n     \nRead more about how the US election works.\n \n            Every two years, every seat in the House, all 435 of them, is up for grabs. Most of those seats are relatively safe for either Republicans or Democrats, but there is always the possibility that the majority changes hands.\n     \n            Democrats are favored in 208 races and Republicans are favored in 212, according to preelection House race ratings from the nonpartisan analysis site Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. With just 15 races listed as toss-ups, it’s likely that neither party will have a very large majority next year.\n     \n            Republicans are heading into the election with a small majority, and it’s entirely possible that Democrats win their own small majority for the next House even if they lose the White House and control of the Senate.\n     \n            It’s important to both parties that they control the House. Presidents want control to enact their priorities. The out-of-power party wants control to block the president’s priorities. In an ideal world, the two sides would work together to find consensus on issues like immigration and the tax code.\n     \n            In the Senate, only a third of seats are up for grabs every two years — and Democrats are on defense as they try to maintain their slim majority. Of the 34 seats for which there is an election this year, Democrats are defending 20 and Republicans are defending 13. Two of those Democratic seats, in West Virginia and Montana, are likely to be won by Republicans, according to the Senate race ratings. Another one, in Ohio, is rated as a toss-up. Democrats hope they can pick up an unexpected win in either Texas or Florida, but Republicans are on pace to have a slim majority in the Senate next year.\n     \n            No matter who has control of the Senate, neither party is expected to have a supermajority. That’s important because senators generally abide by a custom of respecting the filibuster. It usually requires 60 votes to enact major pieces of legislation, although both Republicans and Democrats have found ways around that in recent years.\n     \nRead more about how the US election works.\n \n            CNN did not project a winner in 2020’s US presidential race until four days after Election Day. Multiple states were decided by incredibly close margins that year. It could take a while in 2024 as well.\n     \n            In 2016, Hillary Clinton conceded the day after Election Day even though counting was still happening in multiple states. She acknowledged she would not win.\n     \n            Trump is unlikely ever to acknowledge defeat. If there are close margins in key states, it could take days to determine a winner. The good news is that many states have made changes since 2020 to make it easier for election officials to get a head start on processing mail-in ballots, which take longer to count.\n     \n            In 2000, one of the closest elections in US history, the winner was not apparent until 36 days after the election when the US Supreme Court ended recounts in Florida. Things were complicated that year by flawed paper ballots in some Florida counties, something that should not be a problem this year.\n     \n            But it could also end up not being that close of an election at all, and networks like CNN could project a winner on election night.\n     \nRead more about how the US election works.\n \n            The tumultuous 2024 campaigns are ending with a contrast that encapsulates America’s fateful choice on Election Day.\n     \nEx-President Donald Trump is darkening what is already the most dystopian closing argument in modern American history and flinging new and baseless claims that Democrats are cheating.\n     \nVice President Kamala Harris, while warning about the perils of a Trump second term, is claiming momentum and invoking optimism and aspiration as she lays claim to a “new generation of leadership in America.”\n     \n            Voters — more than 75 million of whom have already cast their ballots — are finally face-to-face with an election that could profoundly change the country and the world and that has people on both sides fearing for their way of life should their candidate lose.\n     \n            Trump is getting more extreme by the hour in outbursts that seem to augur a fresh attempt to defy the will of voters if he loses.\n     \n            He claimed falsely in Pennsylvania on Sunday that Democrats are “fighting so hard to steal this damn thing” and that voting machines would be tampered with, while saying he shouldn’t have left the White House in 2021.\n     \n            Harris is trying to reanimate the feeling of joy and possibility that infused her early campaign rallies. On Sunday at a Black church in Detroit, she condemned those who “sow hate, spread fear and spread chaos” in a reference to her rival. “In these next two days we will be tested,” she said. “We were born for such a time as this.”\n     \nRead the full analysis.\n \n            It’s the last day of campaigning before Election Day, with both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump holding events across key battleground states.\n     \n            Over the weekend, Trump’s closing messaging got increasingly dark as he used violent and offensive rhetoric against his opponent and the Democratic Party.\n     \nHere’s what you need to know:\n \n            Vice President Kamala Harris’ cameo on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” triggered the government’s “equal time” provision, a long-standing broadcast rule former President Donald Trump capitalized on Sunday.\n     \n            “Hello to our great sports fans,” Trump said at the beginning of an unusual 60-second video played during NASCAR postrace coverage on many NBC stations. Trump, wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat, urged viewers to vote.\n     \n            Almost as soon as Harris was confirmed Saturday to appear on “SNL,” Trump allies raised questions about the Federal Communications Commission’s “equal time” rule. Brendan Carr, a Republican who was appointed to the commission by Trump in 2017, wrote on X “this is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule.”\n     \n            The government’s rule tries to ensure if one political candidate gains airtime on a broadcast station, then the candidate’s opponents can request an equal opportunity. News programs are exempt, but entertainment programs like “SNL” are not.\n     \n            On “SNL,” Harris received about one minute and 30 seconds of airtime “without charge,” according to a network filing with the FCC.\n     \n            “We’re two days away from the most important election in the history of our country,” Trump said. “We’ve gotta save our country, and it needs saving, it’s in very bad shape.”\n     \n            Some of Trump’s comments were highly questionable, including his claim “we’re going to end up in a depression based on what’s been happening,” but the video was not subject to fact-checking.\n     © 2024 Cable News Network.

Here’s how it works.\n SpaceX launched nearly 6,000 pounds (2,700 kilograms) of supplies to the International Space Station (ISS) tonight (Nov. 4). A Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Pad 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida today at 9:29 p.m. EST (0129 GMT on Tuesday, Nov. 5), kicking off SpaceX's 31st robotic resupply mission to the ISS for NASA. The Falcon 9's first stage came back to Earth about 8 minutes after liftoff as planned, touching down at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, which is next door to KSC. It was the fifth launch and landing for this particular booster, according to a SpaceX mission description.  The rocket's upper stage, meanwhile, hauled an uncrewed Cargo Dragon capsule to low Earth orbit, deploying it there around 9.5 minutes after launch. The Dragon then began chasing down the ISS; it will ultimately meet up with the orbiting lab on Tuesday (Nov. 5) around 10:15 a.m. EST (1415 GMT). You can watch the rendezvous live via NASA, beginning at 8:45 a.m. EST (1245 GMT). \"In addition to food, supplies, and equipment for the crew, Dragon will deliver several new experiments, including the Coronal Diagnostic Experiment, to examine solar wind and how it forms,\" NASA officials wrote in a mission preview. \"Dragon also delivers Antarctic moss to observe the combined effects of cosmic radiation and microgravity on plants,\" they added. \"Other investigations aboard include a device to test cold welding of metals in microgravity, and an investigation that studies how space impacts different materials.\" Also aboard the Dragon is LignoSat, a tiny wooden probe developed by researchers at Kyoto University and the Japanese logging company Sumitomo Forestry that could help open up a new realm of more environmentally friendly spacecraft manufacturing.

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson)                           SEATTLE (AP) — The voting has closed for unionized factory workers at Boeing who were deciding Monday whether to accept a contract offer or to extend their strike, which has lasted more than seven weeks and shut down production of most Boeing passenger planes. A vote to ratify the contract on the eve of Election Day would clear the way for a major U.S. manufacturer and government contractor to resume airplane production. If members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers vote for a third time to reject Boeing’s offer, it would plunge the aerospace giant into further financial peril and uncertainty. In its latest proposed contract, Boeing is offering pay raises of 38% over four years plus ratification and productivity bonuses. IAM District 751, which represents Boeing workers in the Pacific Northwest, endorsed the proposal, which is slightly more generous than one the machinists voted down nearly two weeks ago. Union officials said they achieved all they could though bargaining and the strike, and that if the current proposal is rejected, future offers from Boeing might be worse. They expect to announce the result of the vote late Monday. Boeing says average annual pay for machinists is $75,608 and would rise to $119,309 in four years under the current offer. Pensions were a key issue for workers who rejected the company’s previous offers in September and October. In its new offer, Boeing did not meet their demand to restore a pension plan that was frozen nearly a decade ago.  \n If machinists ratify the contract now on the table, they would return to work by Nov. 12, according to the union.  The workers got their last paychecks in mid-September, a few days after the strike started, and are likely facing more pressure on their personal financial well-being. Bernadeth Jimenez, who has worked in quality assurance at the Boeing plant in Everett, Washington, since 2022, said she voted “yes” on Monday after voting against previous company offers. She was satisfied with the proposed wage increases, and said she never expected a pension anyway — she’s putting money in a 401(k) plan. “This (offer) is good, and I really want to go back to work,” she said. “This time we’re ready.” Theresa Pound isn’t ready. The 16-year company veteran said she voted “no” just as she did on the two earlier offers that went to a vote.  “Adding 3% (to the previous offer) doesn’t change anything for my future. It still doesn’t solidify that when I retire I’m going to have a comfortable living, and that’s the bottom line,” she said. “Instant gratification is not going to save me.” Both Jimenez and Pound have husbands who also work at Boeing, and both couples anticipated the strike and worked overtime before it started. Still, money is getting tight. “We’re making it by the best we can,” Pound said. “We’re going to run out soon, but it’s not going to be a stopping point for me to say, ‘Well, I’m out of money. I need to go back.’ I’m going to find other ways to make it work.” There were fewer pro-strike protesters in Everett than during the Oct. 23 vote.  At a union hall in Renton, also near Seattle, signs warning against campaigning had been moved from inside to outside, and there was no table with workers handing out “Vote No” material, like the last time. A small knot of workers gathered around a burn barrel to talk and keep warm. The mood was subdued. The strike began Sept. 13 with an overwhelming 94.6% rejection of Boeing’s offer to raise pay by 25% over four years — far less than the union’s original demand for 40% wage increases over three years.  Machinists voted down another offer — 35% raises over four years, and still no revival of pensions — on Oct. 23, the same day that Boeing reported a third-quarter loss of more than $6 billion. However, the offer received 36% support, up from 5% for the mid-September proposal, making Boeing leaders believe they were close to a deal. The contract rejections reflected bitterness that built up after union concessions and small pay increases over the past decade. The new proposal that Boeing made last week offered slightly larger pay increases plus a $12,000 contract-ratification bonus, up from $7,000 in the previous offer, and larger company contributions to employees’ 401(k) retirement accounts. Boeing also promises to build its next airline plane in the Seattle area. Union officials fear the company might withdraw the pledge if workers reject the new offer. Robert Helgeson has been repairing machines in the Renton plant for 34 years. He said he voted to approve the offer on Monday after voting no on the first proposal and skipping the second vote.  “I think this is fair,” Helgeson said, citing the better pay. “It’s as good as it’s going to get. I know everyone wanted the pension back, but we’re just not going to get that.” The strike drew the attention of the Biden administration. Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su intervened in the talks several times, including last week. The labor standoff — the first strike by Boeing machinists since an eight-week walkout in 2008 — is the latest setback in a volatile year for the company.  Boeing came under several federal investigations after a door plug blew off a 737 Max plane during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. Federal regulators put limits on Boeing airplane production that they said would last until they felt confident about manufacturing safety at the company.  The door-plug incident renewed concerns about the safety of the 737 Max. Two of the plane’s crashed less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people. The CEO whose effort to fix the company failed announced in March that he would step down. In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud for deceiving regulators who approved the 737 Max.  As the strike dragged on, new CEO Kelly Ortberg announced about 17,000 layoffs and a stock sale to prevent the company’s credit rating from being cut to junk status. S&P and Fitch Ratings said last week that the $24.3 billion in stock and other securities will cover upcoming debt payments and reduce the risk of a credit downgrade. The strike has created a cash crunch by depriving Boeing of money it gets when delivering new planes to airlines. The walkout at Seattle-area factories stopped production of the 737 Max, Boeing’s best-selling plane, and the 777, or “triple-seven,” jet and the cargo-carrying version of its 767 plane.  Ortberg has conceded that trust in Boeing has declined, the company has too much debt, and “serious lapses in our performance” have disappointed many airline customers. But, he says, the company’s strengths include a backlog of airplane orders valued at a half-trillion dollars.  Koenig reported from Dallas.

            "content": "Sean “Diddy” Combs is asking the court to bar potential witnesses in his criminal case from speaking to the press after a particularly damning interview from a grand jury witness. Lawyers for the disgraced rap mogul had previously filed a motion in late October requesting a sweeping gag order against anyone who could potentially be called to testify.  On Sunday, they filed a new motion asking the court to “immediately restrain extrajudicial statements by potential witnesses and their counsel” while the earlier motion is being considered.  ADVERTISEMENT The filing was in response to several interviews given by a music producer named Courtney Burgess, who claims to have tapes showing Combs allegedly sexually assaulting eight celebrities: four men, two underage boys, and two women.  The celebrities are not being named since they’re allegedly victims of sex crimes.  The “Bad Boy for Life” artist was arrested in September on suspicion of sex trafficking and racketeering for allegedly forcing women to participate in days-long sex parties he dubbed “freak-offs.” Combs and his lawyers have denied the charges.  But more than 150 alleged victims—many of them men and boys—have since come forward, and lawyers have filed more than two dozen civil suits against Combs.  The resulting media frenzy has “substantially interfered” with Combs’ right to a fair trial, his lawyers argued in a motion, asking the court to impose a gag order to avoid a “carnival atmosphere” surrounding the high-profile case.  In their response, prosecutors said enforcing such a broad gag order would require them to hand over their list of potential witnesses a full six months before the trial. They called the request “unprecedented” and a “fool’s errand”—as well as potentially dangerous for the witnesses in question.  In the meantime, Burgess appeared on a true crime podcast claiming he had been given USB drives with eight tapes showing Combs sexually assaulting the unnamed celebrities. Prosecutors saw the podcast and called Burgess to testify before the grand jury in Combs’ case. After he testified, Burgess told reporters outside the courthouse that he didn’t personally know Combs but that thanks to his 35 years in the music business, their social and professional networks overlapped.  Soon after, he and his lawyer appeared on NewsNation, and he told host Ashleigh Banfield more about the tapes. He wouldn’t say who they were from, but he said based on the locations and camera angles, it was clear the celebrities didn’t know they were being filmed. All of them appeared drunk or under the influence of drug, he said.  “How many appear to be potentially victimized?” Banfield asked. “I think all, to be honest, all were victims,” Burgess said, adding that the celebrities didn’t seem to know what was happening to them.  In their request for an immediate gag order, Combs’ lawyers called the claims “false and outrageous,” and said no such videos exist. They also tried to blame the interviews for a raft of leaks from law enforcement officials, who have given interviews to CNN on condition of anonymity. Combs’ trial is set to begin May 5, 2025. Until then, he’s being held in the notorious Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn after the judge in the case ruled he was a flight risk and liable to threaten potential witnesses with violence.  On Monday, he celebrated his 55th birthday behind bars. On the menu: cheese pizza, pasta salad, and green beans for lunch, followed by chicken or tofu fried rice for dinner with black beans and carrots, the New York Post reported. Got a tip?

Amazon gave its Kindle lineup a long overdue refresh in mid-October. The Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is the most interesting device in the lineup, bringing a color E Ink display to Amazon's e-reader for the first time. Although it officially launched on October 30, if your order hasn’t arrived yet, you may have a long wait ahead. That's because Amazon is canceling and delaying the device shipments by a few weeks due to screen issues. There are five new Kindles to pick from The Good e-Reader reports \"severe issues\" with the Kindle Colorsoft's display, one of which is a yellowish bar showing up at the screen's bottom. Many early Kindle Colorsoft buyers are also complaining about the display's hazy and grainy appearance, which is purportedly causing them headaches and eyestrain while reading content. Amazon's listing of the Kindle Colorbook is filled with negative reviews from early adopters. After 475 ratings, it currently has a rating of 2.6 stars. The situation is apparently so bad that Amazon is reaching out to affected users for feedback, asking them to send device logs, and shipping them replacement devices (via Reddit). Due to the issues, Amazon has halted shipments of the Kindle Colorbook. In the US, the device won’t be delivered until mid-November, and in the UK, until November 26.  Many customers who contacted Amazon's customer service about the issues were informed that a potential software fix was in the works. It should roll out in the next 1–2 weeks. Amazon informed Good e-Reader that users can resolve the yellow bar issue by turning off their Colorbook for a few minutes and then powering it on again. As if the display issues are not enough, the Kindle Colorsoft also lacks a dark mode, which switches to a dark background with white text. This makes reading text easier in many cases. Amazon has updated the Kindle Colorsoft's product listing page to reflect this. It now recommends that users \"enable a similar reading experience within millions of books using the Page Color feature, which, like Dark Mode, inverts the book page color to black and the book text color to white.\" The Kindle Colorsoft is a significant release for Amazon, but it seems to have had a rocky start due to screen issues. Only time will tell if the company can resolve these problems through a software update. Your changes have been saved  Email is sent Email has already been sent Please verify your email address.

(AP Photo/Michel Euler, File)       PARIS (AP) — The trial of eight people in Paris on terrorism charges started on Monday over the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty, who was killed by an Islamic extremist after showing caricatures of Islam’s prophet to his middle school students for a lesson on freedom of expression. Paty’s shocking death left an imprint on France, and several schools are now named after him. Paty was killed outside his school near Paris on Oct. 16, 2020, by an 18-year-old Russian of Chechen origin, who was shot to death by police. Those on trial include friends of assailant Abdoullakh Anzorov who allegedly helped purchase weapons for the attack, as well as people who are accused of spreading false information online about the teacher and his class. The proceedings started Monday in the presence of members of Paty’s family, including his two sisters. The trial was held under high security, with many police officers patrolling and making checks outside and inside the courtroom. Five of the accused, who are currently imprisoned, were seated in a wide glass box. Three others, placed under judicial supervision, sat on the defendants’ benches outside the box. \n The attack occurred against a backdrop of protests in many Muslim countries and calls online for violence targeting France and the satirical French newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The newspaper had republished its caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad a few weeks before Paty’s death to mark the opening of the trial over deadly 2015 attacks on its newsroom by Islamic extremists. The cartoon images deeply offended many Muslims, who saw them as sacrilegious. But the fallout from Paty’s killing reinforced the French state’s commitment to freedom of expression and its firm attachment to secularism in public life. “We expect that the justice system will be up to the crime that has been committed,” Francis Szpiner, the lawyer representing Paty’s 9-year-old son, told reporters. “It’s an unheard-of event in the history of the republic. It’s the first time a teacher has been assassinated because he is a teacher.” Thibault de Montbrial, a lawyer for Paty’s sister, Mickaëlle Paty, said the trial “will enable everybody in French society to become aware of the direct link, extremely clear, that exists between fundamentalist Islam ... and the violence that can lead to such a terrifying act.” Much attention at the trial will focus on Brahim Chnina, the Muslim father of a teenager who was 13 at the time and claimed that she had been excluded from Paty’s class when he showed the caricatures on Oct. 5, 2020. Chnina, 52, sent a series of messages to his contacts denouncing Paty, saying that “this sick man” needed to be fired, along with the address of the school in the Paris suburb of Conflans Saint-Honorine. In reality, Chnina’s daughter had lied to him and had never attended the lesson in question. Paty was giving a lesson mandated by the National Education Ministry on freedom of expression. He discussed the caricatures in this context, saying students who did not wish to see them could temporarily leave the classroom. An online campaign against Paty snowballed, and 11 days after the lesson, Anzorov attacked the teacher with a knife as he walked home, and displayed the teacher’s head on social media. Police later shot Anzorov as he advanced towards them armed. Chnina will be tried for alleged association with a terrorist enterprise for targeting the 47-year-old teacher through false information. His daughter was tried last year in a juvenile court and given an 18-month suspended sentence. Four other students at Paty’s school were found guilty of involvement and given suspended sentences; a fifth, who pointed out Paty to Anzorov in exchange for money, was given a 6-month term with an electronic bracelet.  Abdelhakim Sefrioui, 65, is another key figure in the trial opening Monday for the adult suspects. He presented himself as a spokesperson for Imams of France, although he had been dismissed from that role. He filmed a video in front of the school with the father of the student. He referred to the teacher as a “thug” multiple times and sought to pressure the school administration via social media. Sefrioui founded the pro-Hamas Cheikh Yassine Collective in 2004, which was dissolved a few days after Paty’s killing. Sefrioui had long criticized and threatened Muslims who advocate friendship with Jews, including the rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris. Sefrioui and Chnina face 30 years in prison if convicted. Chnina denied any incitement to “kill” in his messages and video, claiming he did not intend to incite hatred and violence, according to judicial documents.  Sefrioui’s lawyer, Ouadie Elhamamouchi, said he will seek to prove his client is “innocent” and that the video filmed by Sefrioui in front of the school was not seen by the attacker. “In this case, he is the only one who never had any link with the terrorist,” Elhamamouchi said. Anzorov, who had wanted to go to Syria to fight with Islamic extremists there, discovered Paty’s name on jihadist social media channels, according to investigators. Anzorov lived 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Paty’s school and did not know the teacher. Two of Anzorov’s friends face life imprisonment if convicted on charges of complicity in murder in connection with a terrorist enterprise. Naim Boudaoud, 22, and Azim Epsirkhanov, 23, are accused of helping Anzorov buy a knife and a pellet gun. Boudaoud also drove Anzorov to Paty’s school. They turned themselves in at the police station, and deny being aware of the attacker’s intentions.  The other four individuals are charged with criminal terrorist conspiracy for communicating with the killer on pro-jihad Snapchat groups. They all deny being aware of the intent to kill Samuel Paty. On Oct. 13, 2023, another teacher in France was killed by a radical Islamist from Russia, originally from Ingushetia, a region bordering Chechnya. —- AP Journalists Marine Lesprit, Nicolas Garriga and Alexander Turnbull contributed to the story.
