            "content": "THIS ARTICLE IS republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota Bay in Florida and Barataria Bay in Louisiana are exhaling microplastic fibers, according to our new research published in the journal PLOS One. Tiny plastic pieces have spread all over the planet—on land, in the air, and even in clouds. An estimated 170 trillion bits of microplastic are estimated to be in the oceans. Across the globe, research has found that people and wildlife are exposed to microplastics mainly through eating and drinking but also through breathing. A plastic microfiber found in the exhaled breath of a bottlenose dolphin is nearly 14 times smaller than a strand of hair and can be seen only with a microscope. Our study found that microplastic particles exhaled by bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are similar in chemical composition to those identified in human lungs. It’s not known whether dolphins are exposed to more of these pollutants than people are. In humans, inhaled microplastics can cause lung inflammation, which can lead to problems including tissue damage, excess mucus, pneumonia, bronchitis, scarring, and possibly cancer. Since dolphins and humans inhale similar plastic particles, dolphins may be at risk for the same lung problems. Research also shows plastics contain chemicals that, in humans, can affect reproduction, cardiovascular health, and neurological function. Since dolphins are mammals, microplastics may well pose these health risks for them too. As top predators with decades-long life spans, bottlenose dolphins help scientists understand the impacts of pollutants on marine ecosystems—and the related health risks for people living near coasts. This research is important, because more than 41 percent of the world’s human population lives within 62 miles of a coast. Scientists estimate the oceans contain many trillions of plastic particles, which get there through runoff, wastewater, or settling from the air. Ocean waves can release these particles into the air. The ocean releases microplastics into the air through surface froth and wave action. Once the particles are released, wind can transport them to other locations. In fact, bubble bursts caused by wave energy can release 100,000 metric tons of microplastics into the atmosphere each year. Since dolphins and other marine mammals breathe at the water’s surface, they may be especially vulnerable to exposure. Where there are more people, there is usually more plastic. But for the tiny plastic particles floating in the air, this connection isn’t always true. Airborne microplastics are not limited to heavily populated areas; they pollute undeveloped regions too. Our research found microplastics in the breath of dolphins living in both urban and rural estuaries, but we don’t know whether there are major differences in amounts or types of plastic particles between the two habitats. Breath samples for our study were collected from wild bottlenose dolphins during catch-and-release health assessments conducted in partnership with the Brookfield Zoo Chicago, Sarasota Dolphin Research Program, National Marine Mammal Foundation, and Fundación Oceanogràfic. During these brief permitted health assessments, we held a petri dish or a customized spirometer—a device that measures lung function—above the dolphin’s blowhole to collect samples of the animals’ exhaled breath. Using a microscope in our colleague’s lab, we checked for tiny particles that looked like plastic, such as pieces with smooth surfaces, bright colors or a fibrous shape. Since plastic melts when heated, we used a soldering needle to test whether these suspected pieces were plastic. To confirm they were indeed plastic, our colleague used a specialized method called Raman spectroscopy, which uses a laser to create a structural fingerprint that can be matched to a specific chemical. Our study highlights how extensive plastic pollution is—and how other living things, including dolphins, are exposed. While the impacts of plastic inhalation on dolphins’ lungs are not yet known, people can help address the microplastic pollution problem by reducing plastic use and working to prevent more plastic from polluting the oceans.

I have vivid memories of being sprayed down with the stuff as a kid before venturing into the woods in northern Minnesota on family vacations and feeling like chemical warfare was being waged on all of my senses. I was willing to endure it because being covered in mosquito bites is even worse. And the truth is, wearing repellent can save your life, protecting you against West Nile virus and Lyme disease, just to name a few of the pathogens mosquitos and ticks can pass on. “Insect repellents are designed to affect insects’ senses and prevent them from finding humans,” says Sonja Swiger, a professor at Texas A&M University’s Department of Entomology. “The use of these products provides protection to humans that cannot be achieved by anything else.” Essentially, environmental mosquito management programs can’t completely protect you from the bugs. If you’re going to be outside for a long period of time, especially in areas where biting bugs are common, applying repellent is a smart idea. The good news is that there are way more products with different formulas available now than, say, when I was a kid. Protecting yourself doesn’t have to be a totally miserable experience. Here is everything you need to know about various insect repelling chemicals, how to choose the right product for your needs, and our top picks for the best insect repellents on the market.

What's the Difference Between the Chemicals Used in Insect Repellents? There are four widely available topical repelling chemicals that have been approved for use by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the CDC, and the Environmental Working Group (EWG), which means there’s ample evidence that they’re safe and effective against mosquitoes and ticks. These are DEET, picaridin, IR3535, and oil or lemon eucalyptus (also called OLE and p-menthane-3,8-diol, or PMD, its synthetic form). There’s also permethrin, which is a repellent you can apply to gear like tents and clothing, which is also approved by the EPA and CDC. ​​Citronella oil, cedar oil, geranium oil, lemongrass oil, soybean oil, and peppermint oil don’t have robust research to show that they’re great repellents for ticks and mosquitos. Though some folks may find them useful, they aren’t long-lasting or effective in environments with lots of bugs, according to the EWG. Below, you can find the pros and cons of the four aforementioned EPA-approved bug repelling chemicals that you can apply to skin. DEET: N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide, otherwise known as DEET, is probably the chemical you’ve heard the most about, as it’s been used since 1957 and widely studied as an insect repellent. “It’s the gold standard that all other products are tested against,” says Swiger. It’s one of the most effective options—studies in the EPA’s database show that, at varying concentrations, DEET can ward off ticks for two to 10 hours, and mosquitoes for two to 12 hours. Per an EPA-approved label, a product with 20 percent DEET can prevent bites from mosquitos for 11 hours. In most instances, 30 percent or less of an active ingredient will be sufficient for protection, says Swiger, and per an EPA-approved label, a product with 20 percent DEET can prevent bites from mosquitos for 11 hours. Per the EPA, DEET can be used on children without any age restriction. The downsides are that DEET smells awful, is oily, and can damage anything with plastic in it, like synthetic clothing and camping gear. Picaridin: This chemical hasn’t been in use as long as DEET, but it’s been shown to be just as safe and effective, and it has fewer downsides. A product with 20 percent picaridin can give you up to 14 hours of protection against mosquitoes and ticks, per an EPA-approved label. A review from the Journal of Travel Medicine analyzed 11 studies that compared DEET and picaridin, finding that “the studies showed little potential difference between DEET and picaridin applied at the same dosage, with some evidence pointing to a superior persistence for picaridin.” Picaridin won’t ruin fabrics like DEET. IR3535: Ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate, or IR3535, isn’t quite as effective as DEET or picaridin against mosquitoes, but it’s more effective against ticks, per the EWG. Like DEET, it can damage plastics. Oil of lemon eucalyptus: Oil of lemon eucalyptus enhanced with para-menthane-3,8-diol (PMD) may work as well as DEET against mosquitoes and ticks (at concentrations between 20 to 26 percent), per the EWG. In general, oil of lemon eucalyptus and PMD don’t last as long as DEET and the other options on this list. They won’t damage plastics. Due to a lack of research on kids, it shouldn’t be used on children under 3. Are Insect Repellents Safe? In order for a chemical to get EPA-approval, it faces rigorous testing and evaluation for its efficacy, safety, and potential harm to the environment. But people still have concerns about the active ingredients in these products. Most of that worry revolves around DEET, due to reports of neurotoxicity. According to the EWG, “in very rare cases, DEET has been reported to impair the nervous system, with symptoms including seizures, tremors and slurred speech—this most often occurs after exposure to high concentrations of the chemical.” This is extremely rare. The EPA has concluded that the rate of adverse reactions occurs on the order of 1 per 100 million persons. Still, that’s really scary. But more research points to DEET’s safety. A report from 2017 found that it’s unlikely that DEET causes neurotoxicity. A 2020 University of Florida study found there was no increased risk of negative health impacts for people who used DEET, and a 2003 report discovered no evidence of an increased risk of adverse toxic effects in kids. Other chemicals on this list, like picaridin, don’t pose the same neurotoxicity concerns as DEET. Ultimately, the repellent you choose comes down to what you feel safe using and your level of concern about bug bites, which can lead to serious health conditions. “These products are continuously evaluated to confirm their safety,” says Swiger. And the benefits of using repellents likely outweigh the risks. “The benefit is preventing biting by mosquitoes or ticks that carry disease-causing pathogens. Without the use of repellents, a person could be bitten by a tick or mosquito carrying a pathogen that can lead to a disease such as West Nile virus, Lyme disease, eastern equine encephalitis, or dengue.” Is a Higher Concentration of a Repelling Ingredient Better? Not necessarily. DEET’s repelling effects, for example, tend to plateau at around 50 percent concentration, per the CDC. Again, 20 percent to 30 percent concentration of DEET or picaridin seems to be enough to get solid protection. Higher concentrations do have their place, though. “Some mosquitoes are not deterred by the lesser rates,” says Swiger. “Higher rates last longer time periods and work best against large floodwater mosquitoes.” How Should You Use Insect Repellent and Sunscreen Together? Swiger recommends applying sunscreen first, then insect repellent, and she says to avoid combo products, per the CDC’s guidelines. Since sunscreen should be applied more often than a repellent, products that include both could result in unnecessary exposure to the repellent chemicals. Are Insect Repellent Sprays, Lotions, or Wipes Better? What kind of formula you choose will really come down to personal preference. Sprays are easier to apply over clothes and skin. Lotions tend to feel less greasy and sticky. Wipes are great for travel and for times when you want to pack light, like during backpacking trips. I used 11 products on hikes, runs, and nights outside near Denver, Colorado. All of them were effective in preventing bug bites, but given the dry climate where I live, I don’t encounter swarms of mosquitoes very often. In my research for this article, I’ve learned that an insect repellent that is considered effective for one person, in one environment, won’t necessarily be effective for a different person in that same environment, or a different person in a different environment. Essentially, mosquitoes and other bugs choose who to bite based on overall smell, body heat, and sweat, and are obviously much more prevalent in wet and warm parts of the country. So rating these repellents on their effectiveness against bugs (based on my experience) doesn’t really give you much valuable information. The only way to know if a repellent will work for you is to try it on yourself in your environment, against your bugs. (And keep in mind, a product that works well for you at home might not do it against different insects on vacation.) If your repellent isn’t working, you need a higher concentration of the repelling chemical, or a different repelling chemical. But, as I wrote above, starting with a lower concentration is the move—there’s no reason to expose yourself to more chemicals if the lower level can provide relief from biting. All that said, I did take thorough notes on how well these went on, felt on the skin, and smelled, and these are my top picks for each chemical category, based on those criteria. Photograph: Kristin Canning With a wide, even, fine-mist spray, this product is easy to apply and doesn’t pool on your skin. It has a chemical smell a bit like rubbing alcohol, but the scent is much milder than that of any DEET products I tried. On my skin, the product feels a bit greasy and sticky, but again, much less so than DEET. Overall, I was pleased with the lightweight feel of the product and appreciated the locking lid on the bottle. Per the label, this spray contains 20 percent picaridin and can provide up to 12 hours of protection. Photograph: Kristin Canning I’d never tried a lotion repellent before, and I was pleasantly surprised by how nice they felt and how much less they smelled than the sprays. This one in particular seemed to have an even milder scent than other picaridin lotions, and left my skin feeling more hydrated than oily. It feels like it absorbs into your skin rather than sitting on top of it. It contains 20 percent picaridin and provides up to 14 hours of protection. Photograph: Kristin Canning This product has the distinct chemical-y, bug spray smell of DEET, but the feel is nicer than most DEET sprays. It’s not totally weightless, but it dries down really nicely and feels soft and only slightly greasy to the touch. The spray is even, but the lack of a locking lid makes me wary to pack it for a hike. Photograph: Kristin Canning The DEET stink is still there, but the lotion formula feels more pleasant and less greasy to me than most sprays. This product in particular contains DEET (at a 20 percent concentration) that’s encapsulated in a slow-dissolving protein, which means the DEET is released over a longer period of time, providing up to 11 hours of protection. Photograph: Kristin Canning These pocket-sized wipes are a bit wet and messy, but that also means one wipe goes a long way in terms of coverage. The smell is less intense than other wipes; it reminds me of rubbing alcohol. These are ideal for throwing in a hiking bag or getting through TSA. They have a 30 percent concentration of DEET, and the package claims up to seven hours of protection. Photograph: Kristin Canning Of all the sprays I tested, this was my favorite. It felt truly dry to the touch after a few minutes, unlike any of the DEET or picaridin sprays. It was also almost completely odorless, which won major points in my book. The spray isn’t as even and fine as I’d like it to be, but it wasn’t a huge barrier to application. Overall, I was really impressed by this one’s lightweight, barely-there feel. Photograph: Kristin Canning This product uses a combo of p-menthane-3,8-diol and oil of lemon eucalyptus, with a 30 percent concentration. It’s very oily and does pool on the skin, so you need to really rub it in. It also has a very strong eucalyptus scent that’s pretty off-putting, but it does fade over time. It has a locking lid, and the packaging says it provides six hours of protection.

            "content": "On Saturday, an Associated Press investigation revealed that OpenAI's Whisper transcription tool creates fabricated text in medical and business settings despite warnings against such use. The AP interviewed more than 12 software engineers, developers, and researchers who found the model regularly invents text that speakers never said, a phenomenon often called a “confabulation” or “hallucination” in the AI field. Upon its release in 2022, OpenAI claimed that Whisper approached “human level robustness” in audio transcription accuracy. However, a University of Michigan researcher told the AP that Whisper created false text in 80 percent of public meeting transcripts examined. Another developer, unnamed in the AP report, claimed to have found invented content in almost all of his 26,000 test transcriptions. The fabrications pose particular risks in health care settings. Despite OpenAI’s warnings against using Whisper for “high-risk domains,” over 30,000 medical workers now use Whisper-based tools to transcribe patient visits, according to the AP report. The Mankato Clinic in Minnesota and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles are among 40 health systems using a Whisper-powered AI copilot service from medical tech company Nabla that is fine-tuned on medical terminology. This story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast. Nabla acknowledges that Whisper can confabulate, but it also reportedly erases original audio recordings “for data safety reasons.” This could cause additional issues, since doctors cannot verify accuracy against the source material. And deaf patients may be highly impacted by mistaken transcripts since they would have no way to know if medical transcript audio is accurate or not. The potential problems with Whisper extend beyond health care. Researchers from Cornell University and the University of Virginia studied thousands of audio samples and found Whisper adding nonexistent violent content and racial commentary to neutral speech. They found that 1 percent of samples included “entire hallucinated phrases or sentences which did not exist in any form in the underlying audio” and that 38 percent of those included “explicit harms such as perpetuating violence, making up inaccurate associations, or implying false authority.” In one case from the study cited by AP, when a speaker described “two other girls and one lady,” Whisper added fictional text specifying that they “were Black.” In another, the audio said, “He, the boy, was going to, I’m not sure exactly, take the umbrella.” Whisper transcribed it to, “He took a big piece of a cross, a teeny, small piece … I’m sure he didn’t have a terror knife so he killed a number of people.” An OpenAI spokesperson told the AP that the company appreciates the researchers’ findings and that it actively studies how to reduce fabrications and incorporates feedback in updates to the model. The key to Whisper’s unsuitability in high-risk domains comes from its propensity to sometimes confabulate, or plausibly make up, inaccurate outputs. The AP report says, \"Researchers aren’t certain why Whisper and similar tools hallucinate,\" but that isn't true. We know exactly why Transformer-based AI models like Whisper behave this way. Whisper is based on technology that is designed to predict the next most likely token (chunk of data) that should appear after a sequence of tokens provided by a user. In the case of ChatGPT, the input tokens come in the form of a text prompt. In the case of Whisper, the input is tokenized audio data. The transcription output from Whisper is a prediction of what is most likely, not what is most accurate. Accuracy in Transformer-based outputs is typically proportional to the presence of relevant accurate data in the training dataset, but it is never guaranteed. If there is ever a case where there isn't enough contextual information in its neural network for Whisper to make an accurate prediction about how to transcribe a particular segment of audio, the model will fall back on what it “knows” about the relationships between sounds and words it has learned from its training data. According to OpenAI in 2022, Whisper learned those statistical relationships from “680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web.” But we now know a little more about the source. Given Whisper's well-known tendency to produce certain outputs like \"thank you for watching,\" \"like and subscribe,\" or \"drop a comment in the section below\" when provided silent or garbled inputs, it's likely that OpenAI trained Whisper on thousands of hours of captioned audio scraped from YouTube videos. (The researchers needed audio paired with existing captions to train the model.) There's also a phenomenon called “overfitting” in AI models where information (in this case, text found in audio transcriptions) encountered more frequently in the training data is more likely to be reproduced in an output. In cases where Whisper encounters poor-quality audio in medical notes, the AI model will produce what its neural network predicts is the most likely output, even if it is incorrect. And the most likely output for any given YouTube video, since so many people say it, is “thanks for watching.” In other cases, Whisper seems to draw on the context of the conversation to fill in what should come next, which can lead to problems because its training data could include racist commentary or inaccurate medical information. For example, if many examples of training data featured speakers saying the phrase “crimes by Black criminals,” when Whisper encounters a “crimes by [garbled audio] criminals” audio sample, it will be more likely to fill in the transcription with “Black.\" In the original Whisper model card, OpenAI researchers wrote about this very phenomenon: \"Because the models are trained in a weakly supervised manner using large-scale noisy data, the predictions may include texts that are not actually spoken in the audio input (i.e. hallucination). We hypothesize that this happens because, given their general knowledge of language, the models combine trying to predict the next word in audio with trying to transcribe the audio itself.\" So in that sense, Whisper \"knows\" something about the content of what is being said and keeps track of the context of the conversation, which can lead to issues like the one where Whisper identified two women as being Black even though that information was not contained in the original audio. Theoretically, this erroneous scenario could be reduced by using a second AI model trained to pick out areas of confusing audio where the Whisper model is likely to confabulate and flag the transcript in that location, so a human could manually check those instances for accuracy later. Clearly, OpenAI's advice not to use Whisper in high-risk domains, such as critical medical records, was a good one. But health care companies are constantly driven by a need to decrease costs by using seemingly \"good enough\" AI tools—as we've seen with Epic Systems using GPT-4 for medical records and UnitedHealth using a flawed AI model for insurance decisions. It's entirely possible that people are already suffering negative outcomes due to AI mistakes, and fixing them will likely involve some sort of regulation and certification of AI tools used in the medical field.

Insurance company UnitedHealth Group is confirming a ransomware attack earlier this year affected the private data of over 100 million people. The number was published in the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights (OCR) Breach Report on Thursday, making it the largest healthcare data breach on the list. Hacker group Blackcat, also known as ALPHV, claimed responsibility for the February attack on Change Healthcare that caused widespread disruptions for healthcare providers processing bills, claims, payroll, and prescriptions for weeks. According to the HHS FAQs page, Change Healthcare told OCR on October 22nd that it’s sent people about 100 million individual notices regarding this breach.  Stolen information may include: As reported by Bleeping Computer, UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty’s written testimony (PDF) to a House committee said the threat actors got in by using stolen credentials for a Citrix remote access service that lacked multifactor authentication.  On February 12, criminals used compromised credentials to remotely access a Change Healthcare Citrix portal, an application used to enable remote access to desktops. The portal did not have multi-factor authentication. Once the threat actor gained access, they moved laterally within the systems in more sophisticated ways and exfiltrated data. Ransomware was deployed nine days later. UnitedHealth paid the group a $22 million ransom. However, another operation threatened to continue leaking the data and may have secured a second ransom payment.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

The iPhone could finally show you how long it’ll take to finish charging. Code spotted in the second iOS 18.2 beta by 9to5Mac shows a new “BatteryIntelligence” feature that will let you receive a notification with the iPhone’s estimated charging time. Some Android phones already show how long it takes to charge — a feature that has become increasingly helpful considering the many different types of chargers, cables, and charging protocols that are available. The iPhone’s “BatteryIntelligence” feature still appears to be a work in progress, though, which means might have to wait a little longer until its official release, according to 9to5Mac. Newer iPhones already have some helpful battery health features. Last year, Apple added a new optimized charging setting for the iPhone 15 and up, which lets you charge the battery up to 80 percent to help it last longer. There’s also a new way to see your iPhone’s battery cycle count.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. There’s a new Oura Ring 4 on the block, but if you’d rather snag a deal, the last-gen model is 20 percent off for Prime Day.  So long as you don’t have new product FOMO, this is an excellent opportunity for bargain hunters. Retailers and companies love discounts on older models right after launching a new one! This is the Horizon model as well, which is normally more expensive than the base Gen 3 due to its fully round shape. Given that Oura comes with a $6 monthly subscription to unlock all the features, getting a discount on hardware can help take some of the sting out. That said, Gen 3 inventory won’t last forever.  While it is the last-gen model, this is a good opportunity to snag some savings while inventory still lasts.  Even if you have FOMO, you won’t be missing out on much. I’ve used the Gen 3 for the past three years and tested a bunch of the competition — this is still the clear winner in my book. Compared to the new model, it’s only missing out on flatter sensors, a larger dock, and a slightly more comfortable form factor. The newer Oura Ring 4 does have an updated algorithm that’s supposed to be more accurate, but functionally, you’re still going to get the same metrics with the Gen 3. That said, if you absolutely can’t stand the idea of a monthly subscription, my second favorite smart ring is also on sale. The Ultrahuman Ring Air is also 13 percent off for Prime Day at $305 and is a great choice if you’re focused on training metrics.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

The news comes after Google first added the feature to its kid-focused Fitbit Ace LTE fitness tracker in August. In a statement given to 9to5Google, the company said there will be ways for parents to supervise usage, with control over approving new cards, removing cards, and viewing transaction history. Parents can supervise children’s accounts via the Google Family Link app that lets parents set restrictions for content and screen time, and added the ability to see when kids leave school and arrive home in 2022.  Kids will be able to make tap-to-pay purchases using standard authentication options, including fingerprint, facial recognition, PIN, or passwords. They can also use Google Wallet to store gift cards and event tickets, but they can’t make online purchases or save health or identification cards. Google’s kids’ payments feature will start rolling out to Google Wallet users in the US and several other countries next year. With the move, Google is catching up with Apple, whose Apple Cash Family service already lets children use Apple Pay for purchases in stores. It also lets kids buy things online as well as send and receive money through messages.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Chris Welch, a reviewer specializing in personal audio and home theater. Since 2011, he has published nearly 6,000 articles, from breaking news and reviews to useful how-tos. Look, I’m a sucker for instant gratification. It’s often one of my favorite things about living in New York City. This morning, Nintendo announced its $99 Alarmo clock, and when the company’s store in Rockefeller Center opened a couple hours later, I walked in and picked one up. Did I feel a little iffy about paying $108.91 after tax for a plastic alarm clock? You bet. But fortunately, in my field, this counts as a work expense. (Technically, this product is called Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo — but no one is ever going to refer to it that way. It’s Alarmo.) The Verge’s senior entertainment editor Andrew Webster will have a full review of Alarmo coming up, but I wanted to check it out for myself. Mostly, I was curious about the audio quality. If the speaker in this relatively tiny clock sounds tinny or shrill, that would ruin the whole concept for me. Turns out, you don’t need to worry about that. I haven’t tried all of Alarmo’s various sounds, but even the Super Mario Bros. theme that plays during the setup process eliminated my worries that it would sound like crap. That setup routine is actually quite lengthy and might prove to be a bit much for a child. You choose the date and time, of course, but you’re also led through configuring the clock’s motion-detection features, which takes a bit of time, and I didn’t see any way of skipping it. Alarmo’s millimeter-wave presence sensor works with bed sizes ranging from twin to king, and the screen is meant to face the middle of your bed. The display is not a touchscreen, nor is it round. (And I feel like Nintendo’s promotional video exaggerates its size a little.) It does automatically adjust brightness based on ambient lighting. One fun little detail is that the clock screen and typeface will change depending on the alarm you’ve chosen. Whenever the regular clock is showing, the character onscreen will also move from left to right based on your own movements if you’re within range of the motion sensors.  You control Alarmo with the buttons up top. The large dial can be turned to navigate menus and pressed to make selections. There’s a back button to the left and a notifications button to the right. I’ve barely used the clock, but presumably, this is where you might get notified about your sleep metrics. (There’s no serious health monitoring or anything like that; don’t expect Mario to warn you about snoring or potential sleep apnea.) The top dial lights up in a range of colors; you’ll see quite a few within the first few minutes of using Alarmo. Aside from the core alarm functionality, Alarmo also has sleep sounds that you can doze off to. Nintendo plans to offer new sounds that can be downloaded to the clock once you've linked a Nintendo account. (When you access this menu, a prompt advises younger users to seek out a parent or guardian.) Is this thing absurdly expensive for what it is? Certainly. But for its demographic, it’s very cute, and there are small, thoughtful Nintendo touches throughout the experience — and I’ve barely dug in. Here are some more photos of the $99 Nintendo clock. Update, October 9th: The article has been updated to clarify that a Nintendo Switch Online subscription won't be needed to install future Alarmo scenes.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. The clocks have fallen back an hour for many of us, and if it all feels a bit disorienting, you’re not alone. Thankfully, Amazon’s versatile Echo Spot is on sale to help you adjust. Normally $79.99, right now you can buy the smart alarm clock at Amazon in black, blue, or white with a free Globe Electric smart bulb for $49.99, which equates to $41.99 in savings. That’s just $5 shy of the all-time low we saw during Amazon’s recent Prime Day event. Amazon’s speedy smart speaker can be set up so that it gently wakes you up with music instead of typical alarm clock sounds, which can be jarring. The Spot is also a lot more useful than your run-of-the-mill clock, as it offers a customizable 2.83-inch screen that displays helpful info (including the weather and music playback). However, unlike Amazon’s larger smart displays, the latest Spot doesn’t push on-screen ads and lacks a camera, so there’s less of a privacy concern. What makes the Spot particularly useful, though, is that it functions as an inexpensive Alexa speaker. That means you can use it to perform all kinds of tasks, from setting reminders to playing podcasts, audiobooks, and music. You can also use it to control other smart home devices with just your voice, including lights and smart thermostats. That’ll come in handy as the days get colder and darker — after all, no one wants to leave the warmth of their bed just to hit the lights. Amazon’s new Echo Spot smart speaker / alarm clock has a 2.83-inch squared-off display for showing the time, weather, music playback, and other bits of info you may want at your bedside. Unlike the original Spot, there’s no camera to worry about having in your bedroom — though it does have a mutable microphone for Alexa voice controls.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine. The Bose Sleepbuds are back. Kind of. After Bose decided to discontinue the product in 2023, three ex-Bose engineers decided to acquire the technology and relaunch the device under the name Ozlo. The buds have been around for a while via a crowdfunding campaign, but starting today, they’re officially available for $299.  Fans of the Bose Sleepbuds will be happy to know the Ozlo buds keep what was great about the originals while making one key improvement: you can now play your own audio, not just a small library of white noise sounds. And if you want the best of both worlds, the buds can switch over from your content to white noise once they’ve detected you’ve fallen asleep. It’s been hit or miss in the few nights I’ve tried it. Some nights, I’ve fallen asleep listening to an audiobook and briefly woken up to the sound of a babbling brook. Success!  Other nights, I’ve woken up the next day several chapters ahead in my book with no memory of what’s happened.  The design of the Sleepbuds hasn’t changed much. To the naked eye, everything looks nearly identical, save for the big Ozlo logo on the case instead of Bose. If you liked the Bose Sleepbuds, you’ll be happy to know these wear exactly the same. (If you didn’t like them, well, you probably won’t like these, either.) While fit will depend on the person, the buds are still super lightweight, and as a side sleeper, I didn’t feel any discomfort. They also never fell out of my ear, unlike Anker’s Soundcore Sleep earbuds. On the flip side, Bluetooth pairing remains a bit finicky. You still have to keep the buds in the case to fully pair them before you plop them in your ears. And even though they do let you listen to your own content now, these are still strictly sleep buds, so you can’t take phone calls on them and they don’t have active noise cancellation. Battery life is also unchanged, at 10 hours, and you can still set private alarms.  Both the case and buds now have biometric sensors for sleep tracking, though that feature isn’t active yet, so I didn’t get to try it. In an email, Ozlo CEO Rockwell Shah tells The Verge that there are accelerometers in the buds, while the case has light, noise, and temperature sensors. Shah says sleep tracking should arrive in early 2025. When it does, the Ozlo buds will be able to detect movement, respiration rate, sleep staging, snoring, noise disturbances, and light / temperature fluctuations in a room, so you can see how certain factors — like a snoring partner — can impact your sleep.  My biggest complaint, however, about the old Bose Sleepbuds was that they were expensive for a pair of sleep-only buds. The Ozlo Sleepbuds are $50 more at $299 — though technically they do pack in more tech. That said, Ozlo is offering an experimental beta program called Ozlo Flex where you can “subscribe” to the buds for $20 a month and cancel at any time, with free returns. (Folks who pay the full $299 upfront do not have to pay a subscription.)  I still need more time with the Ozlo Sleepbuds before I can deliver a final verdict, especially as sleep tracking isn’t available yet. Even so, I’ve clocked a few great nights of sleep and can’t help but root for them. After all, products don’t often come back from the grave, let alone better than before. There are still a few kinks that need working out, but all in all, fans of the Bose Sleepbud should rejoice.

With Hurricane Milton set to become the second major hurricane to hit the US in under a month, the nation’s infrastructure is under strain. In the aftermath of a natural disaster, when power and cellphone service are out, connecting to 911 and friends and family from your smartphone via satellite can be a literal lifeline.  Apple’s Emergency SOS via satellite (on the iPhone 14, 15, and 16) and Google’s Satellite SOS (on Pixel 9 phones) can connect you with emergency services when you don’t have cell service or Wi-Fi. These services don’t require any setup — just dial 911 from a supported phone to reach emergency services over text message using satellite communication.  A new Messages via satellite feature on newer iPhones launched this month with iOS 18. (There is no equivalent feature for Google Pixel.) This is not designed for emergencies like the SOS service, but it can connect you with friends and family when needed. It’s currently available on iPhone 14 models and newer running iOS 18. People affected by Hurricane Helene have posted on social media to share how this service helped them get the word out that they were okay following the disaster.  You’ll need to do some things before you can use the iPhone’s satellite messaging (see below), but it works with iMessage or SMS, provided you’re in the US or Canada, your SIM card is active, and your carrier supports it. The Verge has confirmed it works with Verizon and AT&T, and we’ve contacted T-Mobile.  The Apple and Android satellite SOS features work on iPhone 14 and newer and Pixel 9 models, respectively, and do not require carrier support. All of these satellite services are available to anyone with the supported hardware and are currently free. They require a clear view of the open sky to work, so you must be outside, away from trees or large buildings, and avoid cloud cover.  Below, we’ll cover emergency satellite messaging and then explain how to set up the new messaging service available in iOS 18. We’ll also show you how to share your location via satellite from your iPhone. You can contact 911 using an iPhone 14 or later without cell service or Wi-Fi. No prior setup is required, but, as with all satellite services, you will need a clear view of the sky. The text conversation will include information like your Medical ID and emergency contact information, location, questionnaire responses, and remaining battery life. If you’ve set up emergency contacts in the Health app, you can also choose to share information with them automatically.  If your contacts don’t have iMessage on an iPhone running iOS 16.1 or higher, they’ll get a text alert. If they do, they’ll get a transcript with your messages to emergency services and a map of your location. Calling 911 on Google Pixel 9 devices (Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold) can use satellite connectivity when there’s no cellphone service or Wi-Fi. Here’s how to do it. The new satellite messaging feature works on iPhones 14 or newer running iOS 18. It must be enabled before you are out of service, so set it up now to be sure it’s available when you need it. You can also demo the service before you’re off the grid. You can share your location via satellite using the Find My app, but you need to set this up in advance and use an iPhone 14 or newer running iOS 16.1 or later.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "Hurricanes Helene and Milton have left something particularly nasty behind in their wake: bacteria known to cause “flesh-eating” infections. Florida health officials are warning residents to stay away from floodwaters that might contain Vibrio vulnificus, following a recent rise in cases after the arrival of Hurricane Helene late last month. There are several species of Vibrio bacteria that can cause human illness, including those that can cause cholera, but V. vulnificus is especially terrifying. When these marine-dwelling bacteria enter open wounds, they can trigger a life-threatening condition called necrotizing fasciitis, which quickly kills off skin and tissue surrounding the wound (this destruction looks like half-eaten flesh, hence the misleading nickname). While only about 150 to 200 cases of V. vulnificus are reported annually to the CDC, natural disasters like hurricanes that expose people to floodwaters are known to spark larger outbreaks. Prior to the arrival of Helene in late September, Florida had been having a relatively mild Vibrio bacteria season. But afterward, a substantial rise occurred, with 24 cases reported by the end of September, and 38 new cases in total since both Helene and Milton made landfall. To date, there have been 74 reported cases and 13 deaths, up from the 46 cases and 11 deaths documented last year. The Florida Department of Health “urges residents and visitors to avoid floodwaters and prevent exposure to Vibrio in anticipation of flooding and heavy rain caused by Hurricane Milton,” the department said in its latest statement on the matter earlier this month. U.S. Faces Critical IV Fluid Shortage Though V. vulnificus remains a rare occurrence, about one in five die from these infections. And evidence has been building that it’s becoming a more common problem. Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a public health alert warning that unusual heat waves off the eastern coast that summer may have caused a spike in cases. Other research has shown that reported cases in the eastern United States increased eightfold from 1988 to 2018 and that the range of cases has been steadily increasing northwards with every year. One major reason for this expansion is the effect that climate change has had on the environment, including raising the risk and severity of extreme weather events like hurricanes. People with weakened immune systems are more vulnerable to serious infections from V. vulnificus. But anyone with open wounds or cuts should try to avoid getting into salt or brackish waters. If you still decide to go for a sea swim with cuts, you should at least wear a waterproof bandage, and you should thoroughly wash any open cuts that come into contact with salt and brackish water with soap and running water. The bacteria can also sometimes infect people via certain kinds of raw or undercooked food, so the CDC recommends that people cook their raw oysters and other shellfish. \nhurricane heleneHurricane Milton  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The man faces up to five years in prison for animal cruelty.\n         \n          Severe weather in Florida has killed at least 10 people.\n         \n          A meteorologist explains why dozens of twisters touched down across the Florida peninsula before the storm's landfall.\n         \n          A major IV fluid supplier has temporarily lost its North Carolina facility due to severe flooding from Hurricane Helene, and hospitals everywhere are feeling the crunch.\n         \n          If warmer ocean temperatures persist, we could be looking at more active hurricane seasons—and more disasters—in the years ahead.\n         \n          Before Hurricane Milton makes landfall, you should get familiar with emergency satellite connections available for the latest iPhones and Pixel devices.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "One of the many joys of Halloween is the ample sugary treats that flow into our hands. But new research published today suggests that staying away from sugar in our earliest years of life can have huge benefits down the road, such as reducing our risk of type 2 diabetes decades later. Tasty as sugar is, it’s well known that too much of it added to our diets can negatively affect us, particularly our metabolic health. Some research has found that excessive added sugar might be especially harmful during our early development, including inside the womb and while we’re being breastfed by our mothers. But according to study researcher Tadeja Gracner, there hasn’t been much solid data on the long-term effects of these earliest exposures to added sugar in people—until now at least. “This is not that surprising, because it is incredibly challenging to find situations where people are randomly exposed to differential nutritional environments. It is even more difficult when you think about that happening early in life and being followed long-term,” Gracner, a scientist and economist at the University of Southern California and the RAND Corporation, told Gizmodo.  As luck would have it, though, Gracner and her colleagues were able to find such a situation that had occurred in the UK over 70 years ago, creating a sort of natural experiment. During World War II, sweet foods and treats were tightly rationed in the country, limiting how much sugar the average resident (including expectant or breastfeeding mothers and their children) could consume back then. This decade-long rationing ended in 1953, and with it, people’s sugar consumption soon after nearly doubled. Gracner and her team analyzed data from the UK Biobank, a longstanding research project that has followed UK residents’ health for many years. They compared the health outcomes of people who were conceived just before and after the rationing era ended. “The environment in which we studied these questions wasn’t one of extreme food deprivation, such as famine or severe calorie restriction,” Gracner noted. “Our data showed that rationed food restrictions instead allowed a diet within today’s nutritional guidelines.” People born during rationing were significantly less likely to develop type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure than those born right after, the researchers found. And even if they did develop these conditions, it took longer for them to occur. All in all, the researchers calculated that early life sugar rationing reduced people’s risk of hypertension by 20% and their risk of diabetes by 35%. Rationing also appeared to delay the onset of these conditions by two and four years, respectively. Their findings were published Thursday in the journal Science. While this is far from the first study to find that too much sugar is bad for us, the findings might help pin down exactly when sugar is most likely to be harmful. The researchers found that one-third of the risk reduction alone could be attributed to reduced sugar exposure in the womb, for instance. And the protective effects of rationing were strongest when children’s limited sugar exposure continued past the age of six months, right around the time that they would start eating solid foods. This indicates that restricting sugar during those specific periods of life is likely to provide the most benefit, Gracner says. But it’s a feat easier said than done. “We all want to improve our health and give our children the best start in life, and reducing added sugar early is a powerful step in that direction. But it’s far from easy—added sugar is everywhere, even in baby and toddler foods, and children are bombarded with TV ads for sugary snacks. This makes sticking to recommended sugar guidelines incredibly difficult, starting from infancy,” she said. Though it’s still important to educate families about the importance of reducing sugar in their children’s formative moments, Gracner and her colleagues say that more aggressive action needs to be taken to ease the hold that sugar has on us. “We should also hold companies accountable to reformulate baby foods with healthier options and regulate the marketing and pricing of junk food targeted at kids. With better information, environment and the right incentives, parents can more easily reduce sugar exposure—for their kids and themselves,” she said. At the same time, Gracner and her team aren’t looking to be grinches. “We certainly don’t want to take away the joy of Halloween or the upcoming holidays—a birthday cake, candy, or cookies in moderation are treats we all need to enjoy from time to time!” she added. \nChildhoodDiabeteshypertensionnutritionSugar  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The 25-year-old woman is still making her own insulin a year after having gotten a transplant of her modified stem cells, scientists say.\n         \n          Colin Farrell's private investigator character revealed a big secret midway through the neo-noir series' first season.\n         \n          New research has found a potential link between semaglutide use and a rare eye condition called NAION, though more work is needed to prove causation.\n         \n          Dozens of obesity and diabetes treatments are in the pipeline, some of which may help people lose even more weight than existing drugs like semaglutide.\n         \n          Critics claim that drugs like semaglutide and other GLP-1s can dangerously sap away our muscle mass, but what does the current science actually tell us?\n         \n          New research suggests that endurance exercise can make us much better at storing and then burning off saturated fat.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Some people get a lot of things from their parents. Their eye color, or the shape of their nose, or a crushing, inexplicable loyalty to a terrible sports team, which must be genetic, because why would anyone choose this agony? (Even with the heartache, Go, Habs, Go!) We also inherit some far less obvious attributes, including genetic coding that makes everything else we do possible. Within each of our cells—indeed, the cells of most organisms that have DNA—is a structure called mitochondria, which produces a substance called adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a vital component of the energy we need to stay alive. These tiny cell batteries have their own form of DNA, which is different from that found in cells’ nuclei. In nearly all animals, including humans, that mtDNA is inherited only from mothers. Why that’s the case has puzzled biologists, but new data could provide an answer, and lead to new treatments for some rare disorders. While there are cases of humans having mtDNA from both parents, it’s extremely rare. In 2016, Ding Xue, a professor of molecular and developmental microbiology at the University of Colorado Boulder set out to find out why that is. He discovered a complicated process that causes paternal mitochondrial DNA to essentially destroy itself. “It could be humiliating for a guy to hear, but it’s true,” Xue said in a statement. “Our stuff is so undesirable that evolution has designed multiple mechanisms to make sure it is cleared during reproduction.” In the intervening years, Xue set out to learn what happens in the rare cases where that self-destruct sequence isn’t initiated, and paternal mitochondria is passed down to offspring. He chose to experiment on C. elegans, a tiny roundworm consisting of only around 1,000 cells, but still has some tissues in common with humans, such as a nervous system, gut, and muscles. Scar-Free Healing? A Parasitic Worm Could Be the Key Describing the experiment in the journal Science Advances, Xue said the worms didn’t display any defects when it came to their sensory responses, but were affected in other ways, such as showing a reduced ability to remember or learn from negative stimuli. The altered worms were also less active in their movements. None of this is particularly surprising. Around one in 5,000 humans are affected by a mitochondrial disease, and the symptoms can often include developmental delays, impaired cognition, muscle weakness, and poor growth. Previous experiments revealed that when mice were altered to have two different mtDNA sequences, there were a number of negative effects on their metabolism, activity level, and cognition. What was surprising was that Xue and his colleagues were able to significantly reverse the effects, including returning ATP levels to normal. When they treated the worms with a form of vitamin K2, they found the worms’ learning and memory performance “significantly improved.” Xue’s paper not only explained the benefits of inheriting mitochondria from a single parent—since adding a second parent’s mitochondrial DNA can lead to adverse effects—but also may have laid the groundwork for future treatments of mitochondrial disorders. He said it’s possible that delays in eliminating paternal mtDNA could be what leads to the disorders occurring in humans. “If you have a problem with ATP it can impact every stage of the human life cycle,” he said. Roundworms are simple creatures, and it’s unlikely that simply giving humans with mitochondrial disorders vitamin K2 will fully cure their conditions. But the disorders can be hereditary, and Xue said that, while much more research needs to be done, it’s possible that giving vitamin K2 to mothers with a family history of the disease could lessen the chances of passing them on to their kids. There’s still no hope for a cure for the annual disappointment of missing the playoffs.

            "content": "Apple recently realized it could make its watch even smarter by adding sensors to the band and the dial. A recent report reveals that the Cupertino company was granted 38 patents on November 5, 2024, by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for a “smart health and communications band for Apple Watch and a future headset.” The patent looks at a stretchable fabric item with an opening to fit around a certain body part. The band could include sensor circuitry for measuring various health data, such as “electrocardiogram measurements, blood pressure measurements, or respiration rate measurements.” The more interesting thing here is that the band doesn’t necessarily point toward being a wristband. It could be any wearable that sports elastic fabric, such as a “head band, a hat, an undergarment, a shirt, pants, shorts, yoga clothing or other athletic attire, an arm band, an elastic belt, a sock, a glove,” and so on. However, the patent is more focused on specifically the wristband and the headband. So, while it’s possible that we might see Apple releasing entirely new wearables embedding health sensors, the greater probability is that either the Apple Watch will get smarter or the Apple Vision Pro will receive additional health-tracking capabilities. The patent also includes additional uses for the smart band (via TechRadar). It claims that the circuitry along the fabric could be given the ability to recharge wirelessly and to “communicate wirelessly with external electronic equipment.” The latter points towards its ability to connect to other Apple devices (MacBook, iPhone, AirPods). We have seen how big Apple is regarding ecosystem integration, and it only makes sense that “external electronic equipment” would be its own offerings. This isn’t Apple’s first time filing patents for smart fabric. Around a month ago, it put in a request for a touch-sensitive smart textile, and before that, once in 2022 and 2019. If Apple’s plans come to fruition, time will tell how successful they are. Looking at how massively the Apple Vision Pro failed, it’s apparent why Apple is trying to revive it. I wonder how the new health features will affect its price, considering it’s already exorbitantly priced. As for the Apple Watch, considering that it’s already one of the company’s successful offerings, I wonder if stuffing additional sensors would come off as an overkill. The recent stuffing of AI in every other product released this year has shown us that too much of something isn’t always appreciated. \nAppleApple Vision ProApple Watch  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The visionOS 2.2 developer beta for the Apple Vision Pro finally added ultra-wide Mac mirroring, and it's the most exorbitant, premium way of using a MacBook.\n         \n          The iOS 18.2 beta has a ton of awesome features you can try right now, like the Image Playground app and upgraded writing tools.\n         \n          The ‘Zero’ AR glasses run web apps and includes self-made lenses.

Naturally that means it will be among the hottest holiday sale items when Black Friday and Cyber Monday roll around. If you just can’t wait that long, jump on this $40 sale offer from Samsung and combine it with up to $100 in instant trade-in credit to get your own Galaxy Ring for as little as $260. See at Samsung The Galaxy Ring’s incredible battery life, perfect pairing with Samsung’s Galaxy Watch and Galaxy Phone, and the amazing lightness and comfort of such a small device that can do so much have made it a favorite of reviewers and users alike. The Galaxy Ring is a mere 2.6mm thick and ranges in weight between 2.3 and 3.2 grams depending on the size. (It’s available in US ring sizes 5-13, and Samsung has a sizing guide in case you don’t know your ring size.) It’s thinner than the Oura Ring, and more than a gram lighter, making for greater comfort. The titanium Galaxy Ring comes in 3 colors — gold, silver, and black — and unless you look at the inside of the ring to see its array of sensors, it looks very much like an ordinary attractive piece of jewelry. But those hidden sensors do an amazing job of tracking your sleep, heart rate, skin temperature, and other health metrics, and can automatically detect when you start a walk or a run. All of the information gathered by the Galaxy Ring throughout your day’s activities and your night’s sleep are synced to the Samsung Health app, where they’re displayed on an intuitive and easy-to-read health dashboard. Galaxy AI is used to create your personalized Energy Score, informing you of how ready (or not) you are to engage in a workout. The Galaxy Ring can go up to 7 days without needing to be recharged, and when it does need more juice, the included clear USB-C charging case has a cover that snaps shut to prevent you from knocking the ring off its base and having to root around under your bed or wherever to locate the small device. Just 80 minutes on the charger and your Galaxy Ring is ready for another week of measuring your health. Samsung has dropped $40 from the $400 price of the Galaxy Ring, and you can trade in your existing health-tracking ring or smartwatch of any brand and earn up to $100 of instant trade-in credit to take the price of this top-notch wearable down as low as $260.

            "content": "Forget about a palm reading to know your inner self—striking a flamingo pose might give you more insight into how well you’re doing. In a new study published this week, researchers have found evidence that a one-legged balance test can be a reliable marker of aging, one that might even outperform other commonly used tests. As we age, all of our bodies get weaker and more prone to numerous ailments. But not everyone declines at the same rate, and there are many things we can do to extend the years of relatively good health left on our mortal clock. In this new research, published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE, scientists at the Mayo Clinic wanted to compare different methods of measuring someone’s age-related health, in hopes of making it easier to track how well we’re aging in our golden years. The study involved 40 healthy people over the age of 50, with half being under 65. The volunteers underwent several physical tests, including having their hand grip strength and gait (a person’s walking and running pattern) measured. They also took several tests of their balance, one of which had them try to stand on their non-dominant leg for 30 seconds. The researchers found that most measures correlated well with age, in that as people got older, they tended to have lower grip or knee strength, for instance. The exception was gait, which didn’t appear to be significantly affected by age. And the single clearest measure associated with age was actually how long a person was able to stand like a flamingo on one leg. This pattern held true for men and women as well. “These findings suggest that the duration of unipedal stance can serve as a reliable and gender-independent measure of neuromuscular aging for both elderly male and female subjects,” the researchers found. While we might not think about it most of the time, having good balance is key to our health and our ability to live independently, especially as we get older. Accidental falls are the leading cause of death from injury in people over 65, and it’s estimated that about 3 million elderly Americans end up in the emergency room as a result of falling every year. “Balance is an important measure because, in addition to muscle strength, it requires input from vision, the vestibular system and the somatosensory systems,” said senior author and Mayo Clinic researcher Kenton Kaufman in a statement from the Mayo Clinic. “Changes in balance are noteworthy. If you have poor balance, you’re at risk of falling, whether or not you’re moving. Falls are a severe health risk with serious consequences.” Kaufman says that as long as you can manage to stand upright on one leg for 30 seconds, you’re doing alright. But if that isn’t the case or you’re simply looking to keep your stability up, you can improve your balance over time by regularly attempting exercises like a one-legged stand (other balance exercises can be seen here). Of course, any kind of exercise done routinely can improve your health, no matter the age. “If you don’t use it, you lose it. If you use it, you maintain it,” he said. “It’s easy to do. It doesn’t require special equipment, and you can do it every day.” \nExerciselife expectancy  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          New research shows that prolonged standing at desks doesn’t improve heart health, and may even come with its own risks.\n         \n          New research finds that humankind's once-steady rise in life expectancy is slowing down, raising the question of whether we'll be able to expand our lifespan much further.\n         \n          Higher flexibility correlated with a lower risk of dying early in middle-aged people.\n         \n          A new review finds limited high-quality evidence that light to moderate alcohol consumption can extend our lives, challenging a long-held belief.\n         \n          New research suggests that endurance exercise can make us much better at storing and then burning off saturated fat.\n         \n          Researchers found evidence that evening exercisers might get better heart and health benefits.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "The benefits of Ozempic and similar medications could be profound on a population level. New research has estimated that expanding access to these newer weight loss and diabetes drugs could save thousands of lives in the U.S. every year. The recently approved drugs semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro and Zepbound) have proven to be far more effective at helping people lose weight than diet and exercise alone—yielding about 15% to 20% lost weight in clinical trials. And practically every week, there’s been another study suggesting that their benefits extend beyond simple weight loss. This new research, published Tuesday in the journal PNAS, takes a stab at tallying up the positive effects they may have on our collective mortality. While the connection between higher weight and poorer health is more complex than commonly portrayed, obesity is associated with a higher risk of various health problems, including conditions that predispose us to an earlier grave like type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Before these GLP-1 drugs became known as blockbuster medications for weight loss, they had and have continued to be valuable treatments for type 2 diabetes. And large-scale trials have found that Wegovy specifically can reduce the risk of cardiovascular and kidney disease in obese people vulnerable to it. Only a sliver of Americans eligible for GLP-1 drugs are actually using them, though, likely due to several factors, particularly a routine lack of health coverage and high cost otherwise. Without insurance, for instance, the list price of Wegovy is upwards of $1,000 a month. Researchers at the Yale School of Public Health and the University of Florida calculated what would happen if these drugs were more widely accessible and taken, with a particular focus on the deaths that could be prevented by treating someone’s obesity or diabetes. Right now, about 40% of American adults are thought to be obese (having a body mass index over 30). Yet only around 10% of this group is taking a GLP-1 drug for obesity or diabetes, according to data cited by the researchers. Overweight people are also eligible for these drugs if they have diabetes or certain other obesity-related conditions, and uptake is similarly low there as well. Even under this current low-use scenario, the researchers estimated that roughly 8,500 deaths are being prevented annually. But under an expanded access scenario, about 42,000 deaths would be prevented annually, they estimated. Among people with type 2 diabetes, more than 11,000 deaths could be prevented. “As a major risk factor for several chronic diseases, obesity is a national public health crisis. Our findings highlight the immense promise of the new generation of weight-loss drugs to mitigate the mortality and morbidity associated with obesity and diabetes,” the researchers wrote. These numbers are estimates, of course, and subject to numerous assumptions. But the researchers did take into account existing data on people’s willingness to start GLP-1 therapy if eligible (around 75%, according to one survey), and their ability to stay on the drugs for long (the real world adherence rate ranges between 25% to 50% over a year’s time, based on other studies). They additionally modeled a very rosy scenario, where most everyone eligible would take GLP-1s (89%) and then all stay on it; under those conditions, GLP-1 drugs could prevent over 160,000 deaths a year, they found, while 41% of people living with obesity would no longer be obese. In the real world, though, there are plenty of valid reasons why even eligible people might not want to take these drugs. Their most common side-effects are diarrhea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal symptoms that could be too much of a hassle for someone to tolerate (thankfully, these symptoms do seem to wane over time for most). A minority also don’t respond as expected, losing next to little weight while on them. And some people, even if they can afford the drugs, may simply not want to deal with the potentially lifelong upkeep of a weekly shot. On the other hand, the public demand for these drugs has regularly outstripped their supply, leading to shortages. These shortages and high costs have also fueled a thriving grey and black market for the drugs, with many people choosing to buy cheaper, if less guaranteed to be safe, versions of semaglutide and tirzepatide. So at least for now, there are plenty of people who would like to but aren’t able to obtain these drugs through legitimate means. And the researchers say that more has to be done to make sure eligible people can have safe and easy access to them. “Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach,” said study author Burton Singer, an adjunct professor of mathematics at the Emerging Pathogens Institute at the University of Florida, in a statement from Yale. “We need to ensure that drug prices are more aligned with manufacturing costs and increase production capacity to meet demand. At the same time, we must tackle the insurance and accessibility issues that prevent many people from getting the treatment they need.” \nGLP-1OzempicWeight loss  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Researchers have found \"tremendous long-term outcomes\" for teenagers who underwent surgery to treat their severe obesity a decade earlier.\n         \n          Research from earlier this week is the latest to suggest that semaglutide and other GLP-1 drugs can help treat people's addiction to both opioids and alcohol. \n         \n          A new survey shows that most people would rather try dieting to lose weight than take the latest injectable drugs like Ozempic.\n         \n          New research suggests GLP-1 medications can blunt people's cravings for potentially addictive substances like opioids.\n         \n          The rate of adult obesity has finally stopped climbing in recent years, new CDC data shows.\n         \n          Few medications have become as popular and culturally relevant as Ozempic has, but how exactly do it and similar drugs affect our body?

            "content": "A California toddler’s encounter with a venomous rattlesnake turned out to be plenty costly for his family. Though the boy was successfully treated with antivenom, the lifesaving medication originally came with a bill totaling over a quarter million dollars. The story is yet another example of how hospitals can substantially drive up the sticker price for relatively cheap interventions. The harrowing tale of financial misery was reported last week by KFF Health News, as part of its ongoing monthly project with NPR to highlight particularly egregious medical bills. According to KFF, 2-year-old Brigland Pfeffer had been playing with his siblings in his family’s backyard when his right hand was bitten by a small rattlesnake. By the time an ambulance arrived to take Brigland to the Palomar Medical Center Escondido, his hand has already turned purple and swollen. Though doctors initially struggled to deliver the standard snakebite treatment—an antivenom drug called Anavip—into Brigland’s body, they did eventually succeed and Brigland recovered well enough to be discharged from the hospital within a few days. Unfortunately, the snakebite was only the start of the Pfeffers’ trouble, as they came home to a bill of $297,461. The bill covered two ambulance rides, an emergency room visit, and the several days that Brigand spent in pediatric intensive care, but the bulk of the costs concerned the antivenom he received, totaling $213,278. While snakebite treatment is often an extensive process, requiring many doses of antivenom to ensure the patient’s recovery, the actual cost of manufacturing these drugs doesn’t explain the sheer size of the Pfeffers’ bill. Stacie Dusetzina, a professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who reviewed the bills at the request of KFF Health News, told the outlet that the family’s charges were “eye-popping.” “When you see the word ‘charges,’ that’s a made-up number. That isn’t connected at all, usually, to what the actual drug cost,” she added. According to research cited by KFF, the actual costs needed to mass-produce antivenom are $14 a vial, with $9 allocated to its manufacturing. And while there are other important considerations that go into the pricing of antivenom, the same research estimated that around 70% of the typical cost can be attributed to hospitals marking up the price. This marking up is done both to generate revenue for the hospitals and to balance overhead costs elsewhere, according to KFF. The result is an overly complicated pricing scheme where the list price of antivenom is not only significantly higher than what hospitals actually pay but also varies widely between hospitals. At the first hospital Brigland visited, for instance, the family was charged $9,574 per vial for ten vials, while the second hospital charged them $5,876 per vial for twenty vials. For context, Medicare and hospitals tend to pay around $2,000 per vial, Dusetzina said. Thankfully, the Pfeffers’ insurer did negotiate down and cover most of the costs of their son’s antivenom treatment. But the family still had to pay $7,200 (the maximum out-of-pocket ceiling of their insurance plan) for it, and they had to pay other bills not covered by their insurance, particularly for one of the ambulances used to transport Brigand to the hospital. Brigand’s mother, Lindsay Pfeffer, also told KFF that the family received a letter this summer informing them that they still owe an additional $11,300 to cover his care. Brigland, for his part, has recovered well, though lingering nerve damage and scar tissue has continued to affect the dexterity of his right thumb and he’s since become left-handed as a result. “He’s very, very lucky,” Pfeffer told KFF. \nantivenommedical billingsnakebite treatment  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n      Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "If you’ve ever had a high blood pressure reading, there’s a chance your arm position skewed the result. A study out this week finds that two common positions for taking blood pressure can often lead to overestimates. It’s possible these flubs may lead to people getting mistakenly diagnosed with hypertension, the researchers say. Blood pressure is one of the most important metrics for evaluating a person’s overall health. Chronically high blood pressure, or hypertension, is known to raise the risk of heart disease and stroke, two major leading causes of death, and high blood pressure can be an indicator of other health issues such as type 2 diabetes. But these new findings suggest that there is a glaring blind spot in how doctors and patients at home are conducting this essential test. Researchers at Johns Hopkins performed the study, published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine. They recruited 133 adults between the ages of 18 and 80 to take part in a crossover randomized trial, meaning that the volunteers all participated in the different conditions of the study (but in randomized order). The participants had their blood pressure taken via their arm in three ways: the widely recommended position of supporting their arm on a desk, having their arm dangling by the side unsupported, and having their hand rested on their lap. Compared to the gold standard method of having the arm supported on a desk, the other two methods consistently resulted in higher blood pressure readings, the researchers found. On average, using a lap-rested arm led to a systolic blood pressure measurement (the top number) 3.9 mm Hg higher than normal and a diastolic measurement (the bottom number) 4 mm Hg higher. Using an unsupported arm led to a systolic measurement 6.5 mm Hg higher than normal and a diastolic reading 4.4 mm Hg higher. For context, a blood pressure reading of 130/80 is the threshold for hypertension. And the researchers say that doctors relying on these two methods could certainly misdiagnose some of their patients as having high blood pressure. Similar misreadings could also happen with patients taking their blood pressure at home. “This crossover randomized clinical trial showed that commonly used arm positions (lap or side) resulted in substantial overestimation of BP readings and may lead to misdiagnosis and overestimation of hypertension,” they wrote. Some previous research has found that subtle factors like arm positioning or support can affect blood pressure measurements, but this study appears to be one of the first randomized trials to try quantifying the difference. Other research has suggested that even the location of a test can affect people’s readings. One such well-known phenomenon is “white coat hypertension,” which is when people consistently have higher blood pressure readings at a doctor’s office than at home, possibly due to anxiety (that said, people with white coat hypertension may still have a higher cardiovascular risk than someone with normal blood pressure at all times) The researchers hope that their findings can help other doctors and patients. “Health care providers need to be reminded about the importance of taking the time to do these steps properly,” senior researcher Tammy Brady, medical director of the pediatric hypertension program at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center, told CNN. “I also hope this study educates patients, empowering them to advocate for proper measurement when they’re in a clinic setting.” \nblood pressure  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n      Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

The Fitbit Charge 6 is currently the bestseller in its category on Amazon and it’s now priced at $99 down from its original $159. This is a massive 40% discount which brings the device to its all-time low price. The Charge 6 is Fitbit’s most advanced fitness tracker and boasts an impressive array of features. It offers over 40 exercise modes, built-in GPS, and Fitbit’s most accurate heart rate monitoring to date. The device also includes an ECG function, oxygen saturation monitoring and stress management tools. With a 7-day battery life and water resistance up to 50 meters, it’s designed for continuous wear and use. See at Amazon One of the much appreciated features of the Fitbit Charge 6 is its ability to display heart rate on compatible gym equipment via Bluetooth, making it easier for users to stay in their target zones during workouts. The device also offers YouTube Music controls, Google Maps integration, and Google Wallet support, enhancing its functionality beyond just fitness tracking. Remember, Fitbit was acquired by Google in 2021. Equally impressive is the early Black Friday deal on the Fitbit Versa 4, now available for $119, reduced from its regular price of $199. This 40% discount also marks the lowest price ever for this smartwatch. The Versa 4 is a more comprehensive smartwatch option, offering a larger 1.69-inch display and a broader range of smart features. It includes built-in GPS, over 40 exercise modes, and a daily readiness score to help users optimize their workouts. The Versa 4 also provides advanced sleep tracking, stress management tools, and various health metrics.

Not when Amazon has dropped a limited-time deal from out of nowhere that suddenly offers the Samsung Galaxy Watch6 smartwatch at its lowest price of all time — just $160. See at Amazon The recent release of the Galaxy Watch7 is what likely makes this deal possible, but the differences between the Galaxy Watch7 and Galaxy Watch6 aren’t great enough to walk past this deal that brings the Galaxy Watch6’s price down from $300 all the way to $160 — its lowest price ever at Amazon. It’s not open-box or refurbished, either. The Samsung Galaxy Watch6 truly stands out among all wearables for its fitness tracking and coaching abilities. When connected to an Android phone with the Samsung Health app, the Galaxy Watch6 tracks your workouts and sets personalized heart-zone rates, allowing you to train at the perfect levels to reach your fitness goals. Your all-important recovery sleep is also enhanced by the Samsung Galaxy Watch6’s Advanced Sleep Coaching, which learns and analyzes your sleep patterns, giving you insight into how you sleep and how you can develop habits to be even more well-rested. The Galaxy Watch6 also can give readings on your body fat, skeletal mass, hydration levels, and BMI at any time. As great of a fitness and health tracker as the Galaxy Watch6 is, it is most definitely not one of those chunky and clunky-looking watches you see at the gym or on the track. It’s beautifully designed, with a thinner bezel than previous versions of the Galaxy Watch to maximize the size of the vivid color screen, protected by Sapphire Glass. And you can completely change the look of the Galaxy Watch6 with an easy swap of bands, going from a more-rugged workout version to an understated, elegant one for work or special events. Upon its much-heralded release in 2021, the Samsung Galaxy Watch6 retailed at $300, and aside from the occasional sales event, it has remained at that price consistently. That’s why this unannounced limited-time Amazon sale is such a big deal — the Samsung Galaxy Watch6 has never been priced lower on Amazon than it is now at $160. It’s unlikely the price will go even lower for Black Friday or Cyber Monday, so this is the perfect opportunity for some very-early holiday shopping.

            "content": "The White House on Wednesday said that federal agencies have completed all the tasks they committed to during the first year of the Biden administration’s executive order on artificial intelligence. The rapid development of generative AI systems over the last two years caught many federal agencies unprepared and the 2023 executive order was aimed at modernizing the government’s internal practices to prepare agencies to responsibly use AI systems—generative or otherwise—and regulate them in their respective domains. A top priority of the executive order was establishing some government oversight for tech companies developing the most powerful AI systems. In its press release on Wednesday, the White House touted its success in that area. The Department of Commerce has signed agreements with OpenAI and Anthropic that grant the agency access to test the companies’ new models before their release and under a new proposed regulation, other developers will be required to report the results of their safety tests to the department on a quarterly basis. That work is part of a broader effort in the Commerce Department, through its newly formed AI Safety Institute, to establish standard practices for testing models and mitigating their risks. At the moment, there is little consensus on when and how to evaluate emerging models and practices vary by developer. Other federal agencies have spent the past year creating new rules and guidance documents for organizations that are the end users of AI systems. The Department of Health and Human Services began tracking instances of harmful AI use in health systems and finalized rules for using AI in clinical settings and for mitigating discrimination in healthcare algorithms. The Department of Labor, Department of Education, and housing regulators also published AI toolkits and best practices for the organizations they regulate. The White House said the federal government has hired more than 250 AI practitioners as part of a targeted “talent surge” and created a Chief AI Officers’ Council to coordinate and share resources between agencies. Many of the most important goals laid out in the 2023 executive order, however, require long-term efforts. In particular, a new policy from the Office of Management and Budget requires most agencies to implement strict policies for assessing, procuring, using, and monitoring their AI tools. Given the purchasing power of the federal government, if agencies effectively and reliably implement the new rules they could significantly affect the quality of AI systems that are developed for commercial markets. Of course, those long-term plans could change based on the outcome of next month’s presidential election. Donald Trump has made killing the AI executive order part of his campaign platform. \nArtificial intelligenceexecutive orderJoe Biden  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Identifying when animals are in pain is good for moral reasons, of course, but also for maximizing their productivity.\n         \n          Conversational search will understand memory and context so you can talk to it like a person.\n         \n          Notepad is getting AI features that Microsoft claims will help you improve your writing.\n         \n          Google accidentally leaked its AI agent on the Chrome extension store but quickly removed it.

Police in Yemassee, South Carolina, are trying to track down over 40 rhesus monkeys that recently escaped from a nearby lab. While members of the public have been told to keep their homes secured and to stay away from the monkeys if they see them, the animals apparently don’t pose any health risk. The Yemassee Police Department reported the great primate escape in a Facebook post Wednesday afternoon. The monkeys somehow managed to slip out of the Alpha Genesis Primate Research Center, which claims to provide the “highest quality nonhuman primate products and bio-research services.” In its latest update this morning, the department said that 43 rhesus macaques in total have fled the coop, none of whom have been captured yet by the police or lab staff. While the lab is known to use monkeys as part of its research into progressive brain disorders, the escapees don’t appear to be particularly dangerous. The primates are all reportedly females weighing around six pounds who are too young to have been used in any research yet and to be carrying any diseases in general. Yemassee police said Thursday that there is “no health risk associated with these animals.” At the same time, no one should be trying to get nice and cozy with the monkeys if they happen to spot them. “Residents are strongly advised to keep doors and windows secured to prevent these animals from entering homes,” the department said Thursday. “If you spot any of the escaped animals, please contact 911 immediately and refrain from approaching them.” This isn’t the first time that primates have left the confines of the Alpha Genesis Primate Center. The Post and Courier newspaper in Beaufort County (where the town is partially located) reported Wednesday that the facility has experienced several escapes since 2014, and that it has accrued several violations handed down by the U.S. Department of Agriculture connected to these escapes and other incidents between 2014 and 2016. Yemassee police are working with the nearby sheriff’s office, state agricultural and wildlife officials, and Alpha Genesis lab staff to bring the monkeys back home. They’re reportedly using traps to capture the monkey safely, along with thermal imaging to help find them. No word yet on whether they will be recruiting the assistance of a mustachioed plumber in a red shirt and blue overalls or his cowardly brother. \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n      Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

Forcing patients to undergo regular X-rays, regardless of any obvious dental issues, is not only harmful, they argue, but goes against the standards set by the American Dental Association (there’s a joke to be made about nine out of 10 dentists agreeing that it’s bad, but no studies support that punchline). The debate kicked off back in May, when a trio of Brazilian dentists wrote a letter to Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), complaining that their field had fallen behind the times. They complained that dentistry had become too influenced by the economics of running a clinic, pricing many people out of care while those who can pay are often over-diagnosed and over-treated. While not mentioned specifically, X-rays became a hot topic in the comments. While many physicians from various fields argued the tool was overused, others disagreed, saying the imaging technology is crucial for preventing tooth decay and other dental and periodontal diseases. X-rays are wildly popular among dentists. A 2023 study found that 320 million dental radiography procedures were performed in 2016, or just under one for every resident of the country. That’s incredible, given that, according to the CareQuest Institute for Oral Health, over a quarter of the population doesn’t have dental insurance. The costs of X-rays can vary by both type and geographic location, but average out to between $30 and $750 for a set, according to dental care financing company CareCredit In a response to the Brazilian letter, published in JAMA on October 14, Sheila Feit, a retired dentist in Syosset, New York, noted that the ADA changed its guidelines in 2012 to recommend adult patients with no cavities, and no increased risk of developing cavities, get new X-rays every two to three years. Those guidelines were updated once more in April 2024. The experts who worked on the revised guidelines pointed out, in the Journal of the American Dental Association, that while the level of radiation in a dental X-rays is almost always below the threshold that can lead to serious damage, “any amount of ionizing radiation can increase the risk of adverse health effects.” Sweeping Review Finds No Link Between Cell Phones and Cancer Instead of X-rays being used at set time intervals, like every six months or once a year, dentists should instead break them out “based on diagnostic and treatment planning needs, and dentists shall make a good-faith attempt to obtain radiographs from previous dental examinations,” they wrote. In other words, X-rays should only be taken when they’re needed. The experts added that this determination shouldn’t just be made from a dentist’s best judgment, but should also involve a discussion with patients about the benefits and risks involved. In yet another response, Yehuda Zadik, an associate professor at Israel’s Hebrew University, compared using dental imaging to fit a crown to the now-arcane practice of X-raying kids’ feet while shoe shopping. It would be inappropriate to “perform routine radiographs automatically during each periodic examination before conducting a clinical examination,” he wrote. “This practice could be likened to performing periodic full-body computed tomography scans without specific clinical indications, symptoms, or patient concerns.” There have actually been a few updates to dental X-ray best practices that might come as a shock to those of us who have recently been in that surprisingly comfy chair. In February, the ADA introduced a new set of recommendations for best X-ray practices. Among them was the recommendation to stop using those heavy lead aprons when imaging patients. In a press release announcing the change, the ADA said studies had shown the aprons, as well as thyroid collars, weren’t necessary to protect patients from radiation exposure, regardless of age, or even if the patients were pregnant. The association noted that the protective gear could even interfere with the imaging, meaning even more X-rays would be necessary. There’s a lot of misinformation about dental X-rays out there. When queried with “dentist xrays once a year,” Google’s AI confidently asserted that this is, indeed, how often you should have new imaging done. Now that you know the deal, feel confident in engaging your dentist in a discussion next time they try pushing that weird piece of plastic into your mouth. It likely won’t affect your health, but you could save yourself a few bucks. \nDentistryx-rays  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The gargantuan object is driving a \"cosmic two-for-one\" that could shed light on the source of a weird kind of X-ray.\n         \n          NASA selected two space observatory proposals for additional review, and one is expected to be cleared for a 2032 launch.\n         \n          Storms in the tropics were seen emitting medium-duration gamma rays, shaking up conventional knowledge about how lightning manifests.\n         \n          LCLS-II-HE is the second upgrade in as many years for a laser beam in Menlo Park, California, that reveals some of nature's most microscopic mysteries in sharp detail.\n         \n          Two panels by the High Renaissance artist just got the AI treatment, revealing the chemical composition of the works, which could help art conservation.\n         \n          Nuclear devices generate massive amounts of X-rays.

            "content": "One of the deadliest diseases in the world is back on top. This week, the World Health Organization reported that tuberculosis is once again the global leading cause of death from infectious diseases, reclaiming the mantle from covid-19. On Tuesday, the WHO released its latest Global Tuberculosis Report, an annual assessment of the bacterial disease’s toll on humanity. According to the report, 8.2 million people were newly diagnosed with TB in 2023—a record high in the history of the WHO’s modern tracking of TB, which first began in 1995. In total, roughly 10.8 million people became sick with TB last year, and there were approximately 1.25 million TB-related deaths. “The fact that TB still kills and sickens so many people is an outrage, when we have the tools to prevent it, detect it and treat it,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a statement. “WHO urges all countries to make good on the concrete commitments they have made to expand the use of those tools, and to end TB.” TB is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It spreads between people through the air and typically affects the lungs, though the bacteria can invade other parts of the body. Acute cases of TB usually result in respiratory symptoms like chest pains, chills, and coughing up blood. But the infection can often become latent, not causing illness until years later when the immune system is weakened for another reason. People with HIV are especially vulnerable to TB, since they’re much more likely to develop an acute, life-threatening case. TB’s death toll in 2023 was enough to supplant that of any other single infectious disease. Covid-19 remains a real public health threat, but recorded deaths have greatly declined since 2022, both in the U.S. and worldwide (according to data collected by the WHO, there were 320,000 covid-19 deaths reported last year). That said, the numbers are a slight improvement over 2022, which saw 1.32 million TB-related deaths. And there have been some other positive trends as of late. Overall, the global efforts to control and prevent TB are well behind the targets recommended by the WHO. And research into interventions like improved drugs and vaccines for TB is critically underfunded. So much more will need to be done to curtail this major killer. “We are confronted with a multitude of formidable challenges: funding shortfalls and catastrophic financial burden on those affected, climate change, conflict, migration and displacement, pandemics, and drug-resistant tuberculosis, a significant driver of antimicrobial resistance,” said Tereza Kasaeva, Director of WHO’s Global Tuberculosis Program in a statement. “It is imperative that we unite across all sectors and stakeholders, to confront these pressing issues and ramp up our efforts.” \nCOVID-19tuberculosisWHO  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Zishan Alvi bought at least five luxury cars with the money from his scheme.\n         \n          In a new report, doctors in Japan detail how the man was killed by a popular supplement containing Clostridium butyricum.\n         \n          The President appears to have made a recovery, but some people aren't buying it.\n         \n          The woman's injury seems to be the first reported case of evisceration caused by 'covid-19 infection exacerbation.'\n         \n          Covid remains a real public health threat, but it's not the reason for the recent resurgence of measles as some have claimed.\n         \n          Hundreds of covid shots did not make him superhuman nor turn him into goo, scientists say.

            "content": "The sky continues to be the limit for semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. Newly published research is the latest to suggest that semaglutide and other GLP-1 drugs can help treat people’s addiction to both opioids and alcohol. GLP-1 drugs have been a valuable treatment for type 2 diabetes for nearly twenty years. More recently, they’ve substantially changed the landscape of obesity treatment, with clinical trials showing that the newest medications like semaglutide are far more effective at helping people lose weight than diet and exercise alone. Researchers have also now started to study whether GLP-1s can reduce people’s cravings for potentially harmful substances like opioids or alcohol. So far, the evidence for this effect has largely come from animal studies, people’s personal anecdotes, and small studies of GLP-1 users. This new research, published Wednesday in the journal Addiction, takes a more expansive look at the possible benefits of GLP-1s for substance use disorders. How Ozempic Works—and What’s Still a Mystery The researchers analyzed the medical records of over a half million people with a history of opioid use disorder (OUD) and over 800,000 people with a history of alcohol use disorder (AUD). They tracked what happened to people with these disorders who were either prescribed a GLP-1 drug or not, for up to two years. Across the board, the researchers found a clear association between GLP-1 use and reduced symptoms of either substance use disorder. Compared to non-GLP-1 users, people with OUD taking GLP-1s for other conditions were 40% less likely to experience a reported episode of opioid overdose, for instance. Similarly, people with AUD taking GLP-1s were 50% less likely to experience an episode of alcohol intoxication. This reduction in associated risk was similar among different groups of patients commonly prescribed GLP-1s, such as people with type 2 diabetes or people living with obesity. Other recent studies have analyzed people’s medical records and found a similar positive pattern between GLP-1 use and reduced drug problems. But this study seems to be one of the largest of its kind to date, with data collected from over 130 different health systems. The authors were also explicitly aiming to quantify the potential benefits of these drugs in reducing people’s drug-related symptoms. And given their results, they argue that these drugs may not just be game-changers for obesity, but for treating substance use disorders as well. “This study’s findings have the potential to suggest significant implications for both clinical practice and public health policy in the coming years,” they wrote. “Future research should focus on prospective clinical trials to validate these findings, explore the underlying mechanisms and determine the long-term efficacy and safety of GIP/GLP-1 RA medications in diverse populations.” Important as it is to accumulate more evidence for any hypothesis, these sorts of studies alone can’t definitively prove that GLP-1 drugs should be added to the roster of medications for substance use disorder just yet. There are ongoing clinical trials testing semaglutide for alcoholism, and it’s likely that more will follow for opioid use disorder as well. Should these trials validate the findings collected so far, GLP-1s could certainly be an important option for people struggling with drug use, especially since many are unlikely to be treated with existing medications. \nAlcoholismGLP-1Ozempic  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          New research estimates that expanded access to Ozempic and similar drugs could lead to 42,000 deaths prevented annually.\n         \n          A new survey shows that most people would rather try dieting to lose weight than take the latest injectable drugs like Ozempic.\n         \n          New research suggests GLP-1 medications can blunt people's cravings for potentially addictive substances like opioids.\n         \n          The rate of adult obesity has finally stopped climbing in recent years, new CDC data shows.\n         \n          Few medications have become as popular and culturally relevant as Ozempic has, but how exactly do it and similar drugs affect our body?

            "content": "The slew of hurricanes bombarding the eastern U.S. as of late is having indirect impacts elsewhere. Hospitals across the country are facing shortages of IV fluid thanks to the closure of a critical manufacturing plant in North Carolina caused by Hurricane Helene. Hurricane Milton may also affect the IV fluid supply chain. IV liquids are routinely given to hospitalized patients to treat and prevent dehydration, maintain a healthy level of electrolytes, and deliver certain drugs intravenously. Much of the country’s supply of IV fluids is provided by the company Baxter International. The temporary loss of the company’s plant in North Cove, North Carolina, due to severe flooding from Hurricane Helene has imperiled this essential component of inpatient care. According to the American Hospitals Association (AHA), roughly 60% of the country’s daily supply of IV solution—about 1.5 million bags worth of fluid—is produced by the North Carolina plant. And its closure is already wreaking havoc on hospitals. Many health care systems have begun to delay elective surgeries and other nonemergency procedures to stretch out their supply of IV fluids, NBC News reported on Wednesday. Some hospitals are even having their less critically ill patients switch to drinking Gatorade, Stat News has reported. On Monday, the AHA called on the Biden administration to declare a national emergency and take other actions to cushion the blow. “Our members are already reporting substantial shortages of these lifesaving and life-supporting products. Patients across America are already feeling this impact, which will only deepen in the coming days and weeks unless much more is done to alleviate the situation and minimize the impact on patient care,” said AHA president Richard J. Pollack in a letter addressed to President Biden and other senior officials. How Hurricane Helene Disrupted the Solar Industry’s Fragile Supply Chain Hurricane Milton, the latest major storm system to reach the U.S., is also poised to make matters worse. B. Braun Medical, the country’s second-largest manufacturer of IV fluids, announced this week it would shut down two plants in Daytona Beach, Florida, that were expected to be hit by Milton. In an open letter on Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra outlined a series of actions that the federal government will take to address the shortage. These include working with Baxter to speed up repairs of their facility, considering the extension of some IV products at the end of their shelf life, making it clear to hospitals that they can produce, or compound, their own IV fluids as needed, and potentially allowing the temporary importation of IV fluids from outside the country. At the same time, Becerra noted that the loss of the Baxter plant is likely to lead to “further constraints for IV fluids.” Hurricane Helene is estimated to have directly killed at least 230 people so far, while four deaths have been attributed to Milton since it made landfall yesterday. As this IV fluid crisis shows, though, the fallout from these catastrophic, climate change-fueled storms threatens to be even larger. \nhospitalshurricane heleneHurricane MiltonIV fluidsshortages  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Florida health officials have warned residents to stay away from floodwaters, following a spike in cases of Vibrio vulnificus infection.\n         \n          The man faces up to five years in prison for animal cruelty.\n         \n          Severe weather in Florida has killed at least 10 people.\n         \n          A meteorologist explains why dozens of twisters touched down across the Florida peninsula before the storm's landfall.\n         \n          If warmer ocean temperatures persist, we could be looking at more active hurricane seasons—and more disasters—in the years ahead.\n         \n          Before Hurricane Milton makes landfall, you should get familiar with emergency satellite connections available for the latest iPhones and Pixel devices.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Things are heating up for McDonald’s in the wake of a recent Escherichia coli outbreak traced to its Quarter Pounders. This week, Colorado resident Eric Stelly became the first person to sue the chain over the rash of food poisonings, alleging that he became sick with gastrointestinal illness just two days after eating there in early October; he subsequently tested positive for the foodborne germ. CDC Says McDonald’s E. Coli Outbreak Linked to 1 Death and 10 Hospitalizations The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first reported the E. coli outbreak Tuesday, which appears to have sickened at least 49 people, hospitalized ten, and killed one so far across ten states. Most victims had previously eaten Quarter Pounders, though it’s still possible the actual source of contamination comes from the fresh slivered onions exclusively used on the burgers. On Wednesday, Stelly’s lawyers at Ron Simon and Associates filed a lawsuit against McDonald’s in Cook County, Illinois, where the chain’s headquarters are located. According to the complaint, Stelly ate at McDonald’s on October 4 (the CDC notes the outbreak likely first started in late September). Two days later, he began feeling ill with nausea, stomach cramps, nausea, dehydration, and bloody stools, the latter often being a sign of some types of E. coli infection. By October 8, he became so sick that he sought care at an emergency room, where a stool sample was collected by his doctor for testing. Days later, officials at the Weld County Department of Public Health notified Stelly that he tested positive for E. coli. He is reportedly still recovering from his illness. While most cases of E. coli are nothing more than unpleasant, the strain implicated in this outbreak—O157:H7—is known for producing toxins that can raise the risk of severe, life-threatening complications, especially hemolytic–uremic syndrome (HUS). This condition damages people’s blood vessels, which can then cause widespread organ damage, particularly to the kidneys. At least one person in the current outbreak has developed HUS, though this is not the same person who died after contracting the infection. More vulnerable populations, such as very young children or those with weakened immune systems, are at higher risk for severe illness from E. coli and other foodborne germs. Foodborne outbreaks tend to be much larger than reported, since only a small percentage of people become sick enough to seek outside medical attention. But it’s likely that Stelly will not be the only legal repercussion for McDonald’s. The law firm representing Stelly claims to be representing ten other plaintiffs harmed by eating there, and has since created a website for other potential litigants to contact it. “The McDonald’s E. coli Outbreak will be one of the most significant food poisoning outbreaks this year. Through this lawsuit and others, we will make sure that all of the victims are fully compensated for their losses, that their voices are heard, and that McDonald’s and its suppliers permanently fix the health violations that caused the food to become contaminated with E. coli,” said lawyer Ron Simon in a statement from the firm. For its part, McDonald’s claims that the slivered onions potentially behind the outbreak were sourced by a single supplier serving three distribution centers. The company has reportedly paused all distribution of the onions to the affected areas and has instructed all local restaurants to remove the product from their supply; it has also temporarily stopped serving Quarter Pounders in the states where cases have been identified. \ne. coliFood safetyMcDonald’s  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The illnesses were caused by onions, not the beef.\n         \n          Burger King, KFC, and other chains have pulled onions from their products after a potential source of McDonald's E. coli outbreak was identified.\n         \n          \"I think this was orchestrated by deep state Harris supporters after Trump’s visit to McDonald’s,\" one Trump supporter wrote.\n         \n          Most illnesses have been identified in Colorado and Nebraska, but 10 states have seen cases so far.\n         \n          X has truly become a garbage heap since Trump donor Elon Musk bought the site.\n         \n          \"This is a dark moment in our company’s history,\" Boar's Head said in a statement.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

Compared to dogs, cats just don’t see the doctor as often for check-ups. A lot of this resistance can come from past harrowing encounters that cats and their owners have had with vets, according to Nancy Hernandez, an undergraduate researcher in UC Davis’ Animal Welfare and Epidemiology Lab. And in their latest research, Hernandez and her team are hoping to unpack some of the reasons why it’s not so easy to take cats to the vet. Scientists Want to See Videos of Your Cat for a New Study “Many veterinary practices follow published veterinary guidelines to set up their waiting rooms, exam rooms, treatment areas, and to also guide their cat handling techniques. Yet previous research has found that approximately 60% of cat owners do not take their cats for annual veterinary visits due to their cat’s expression of fear and anxiety during physical examinations. The expression of these negative emotions leads the owners to also feel stressed. This overall negative experience hinders owner willingness to take their cats for routine veterinary visits,” she told Gizmodo in an email. “With this context in mind, our main research question is: Are cat caregiver perceptions in accordance with veterinary guideline recommendations?” Personally speaking, both me and my cat—frequent Gizmodo cameo, Cheddar “Chiz” Cara—have never had problems with the quality of the veterinary care provided to us. But there are some things that have made me reluctant to return as often as we should. Namely, it can take far longer than I’d like for the potential costs of Cheddar’s treatments and shots to be fully tallied up and disclosed to me. While I certainly know that vet care often isn’t cheap and I now carry pet insurance for that very reason, the readjusted sticker price of a visit has definitely shocked me. And in general, I do wish that more could be proactively done to make maintaining a pet’s health less of a financial burden on owners. One positive, if modest, development in that direction might be the People and Animals Well-being (PAW) Act, a bill introduced by U.S. House representatives this past September, which would amend the tax code so that pet and service animal care can be paid through health savings accounts (HSA) and flexible spending accounts (FSA). Hernandez and her team’s survey will specifically ask cat owners about their perceptions regarding cat handling practices during physical exams, their attitudes on cat-only areas in veterinary clinics, and if they’d prefer to stay near their cats while they go through routine procedures like having their blood and urine collected. “Our questionnaire is designed with questions about previous veterinary appointment experiences, owner’s opinions on general appointment practices, and they will be offered an opportunity to provide any additional details with an open-ended question,” she said. All survey responses will be anonymous, with only basic demographic information about your cat, like their age, sex, and spay/neuter status, being collected. A link to the survey can be seen here. We at Gizmodo always support a good piece of citizen science research.

This huge discount marks a record low that we haven’t even seen during Prime Day which makes it a unique opportunity for anyone in the market for a high-quality multisport GPS watch. Remember that the new Fenix 8 is priced between $999 and $1,099—essentially double the cost of a Fenix 7—yet the differences in features are minimal.

This early Black Friday deal surpasses even the recent Prime Day deal in October where they were priced at $179 and it sets a new record low price for these premium wireless earbuds on Amazon. See at Amazon The AirPods Pro 2 is the “crème de la crème” of Apple’s audio technology and they’re packed with features that make them stand out in the crowded wireless earbud market. At the heart of these earbuds is the Apple-designed H2 chip which powers their advanced audio performance. This chip enables the AirPods Pro 2 to deliver high-definition sound with a custom-built driver that provides clear high notes and rich bass. The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) capability is one of the most powerful features of the AirPods Pro 2. The H2 chip allows these earbuds to remove up to twice as much background noise compared to their predecessor and creates an immersive listening experience in any environment. Complementing this is the Transparency mode (which lets users hear their surroundings when needed) and the new Adaptive Audio feature that seamlessly blends ANC and Transparency mode based on the user’s environment. But our favorite feature is the Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking. This creates an immersive “theater-like” experience that places sound all around the listener and adapts to their unique ear shape. Users of these AirPods Pro 2 can also enjoy Dolby Atmos content for an – even more – enhanced listening experience. The AirPods Pro 2 excel in call quality as well with voice isolation technology that improves clarity in noisy conditions. For a personalized fit, Apple includes four pairs of silicone tips in various sizes to ensure comfort and optimal acoustic sealing for most users. The earbuds and their charging case are also IP54 rated for dust, sweat and water resistance and make them suitable for workouts and outdoor activities. Apple has also introduced a groundbreaking feature with these earbuds – the world’s first all-in-one hearing health experience. This includes a scientifically validated Hearing Test, clinical-grade Hearing Aid capability and active Hearing Protection, all available through a free software update. This feature set transforms the AirPods Pro 2 from mere earbuds into a comprehensive hearing health device. Battery life is also very impressive on these AirPods as they offer up to 6 hours of listening time with ANC enabled (and it extends to 30 hours with the charging case). The case itself has been upgraded with new features like precision finding, a built-in speaker for easier locating and a lanyard loop for convenience. It’s compatible with various charging methods including Apple Watch chargers, MagSafe, USB-C, and Qi-certified chargers. At this record low price of $169 instead of $249 the AirPods Pro 2 offer exceptional value for money. With Amazon seemingly releasing its Black Friday deals early, this offer on the AirPods Pro 2 stands out as one of the most compelling tech deals of the season.

            "content": "The perils of cancer are more than just physical. New research shows that cancer patients in the U.S. often pay a heavy and lasting financial toll following their treatment, which can then lead to lower credit scores and bankruptcy. The U.S. is known for having some of the best cancer-related outcomes in the world, including a lower mortality rate than many other high-income nations. But the typical costs of cancer treatment (and health care in general) are also far higher in the U.S. than its peers, and many studies have found that cancer patients will commonly experience money troubles as a result of their diagnosis. Two new studies, presented this week at the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Clinical Congress 2024, are some of the first to empirically demonstrate the financial fallout often suffered by cancer patients. In the first study, the researchers analyzed the Experian credit bureau data of patients who were enrolled in the Massachusetts Cancer Registry and first diagnosed with cancer between 2010 to 2019. They compared the financial outcomes of these patients to similarly matched people without cancer, who acted as controls. Compared to non-patients, those who experienced cancer had higher rates of total debt collections and medical-related collections, the researchers found. Cancer patients were also almost five times more likely to declare bankruptcy, and their average credit score was roughly 80 points lower than those without cancer. In the second study, the researchers focused on a subset of patients who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer, looking for potential risk factors that affected their chances of hardship. Compared to patients who only got surgery (the team’s “standard” for comparison), for instance, patients who only got radiation had credit scores 62 points lower. Those who got surgery and chemoradiation seemed to fare the best, with credit scores a bit higher than the baseline of people who got surgery alone. The researchers additionally found that people with bladder, liver, lung, and colorectal cancers tended to have worse declines in their credit score than others. People’s loss of good credit also often followed them for a long time, with declines in their credit score lasting up to 9.5 years. Other risk factors associated with worse financial toxicity included being under the age of 62, not owning a home, not being married, making less than $52,000 a year, and being Black or Hispanic. The team’s research was no easy task to get done, especially since credit bureaus aren’t allowed to share potentially identifiable data with others. To work around this limitation, according to the researchers, the MCR first securely provided its patient registry data to Experian, which then matched and combined it with their credit data. Experian then stripped the combined data of any personal identifying information before finally sending it off to the researchers for analysis. All in all, the effort took five years, but it allowed the scientists to objectively track the financial path of cancer patients compared to non-patients—something that past studies on the topic really haven’t been able to do. “These are the first studies to provide numerical evidence of financial toxicity among cancer survivors,” said lead study researcher Benjamin James, chief of general surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and associate professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School, in a statement from the ACS. “Previous data on this topic largely relies on subjective survey reviews.” The researchers point out that their data comes from Massachusetts, a state where universal health coverage is mandated. So it’s certainly possible that Americans who get cancer living elsewhere will have an even rougher time money-wise. That said, there have been important changes lately in how medical bills generally can affect our finances. In recent years, for instance, the major bureau companies have begun removing paid and small amounts of unpaid medical debt from their reports—changes that do appear to have had a positive impact on Americans’ credit already. This summer, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also proposed a new rule that would prevent medical bills altogether from appearing on most credit reports, which might remove up to $49 billion worth of medical debt that has lowered the credit scores of 15 million Americans. But the researchers still argue that much more needs to be done to protect patients from the debilitating costs of cancer treatment. “This persistence of financial challenges, even in a state with relatively high insurance coverage, calls for broader policy changes and reforms, including reconsidering debt collection practices,” James said. “Further research is needed, but I think financial security should be a priority in cancer care.” \nBankruptcyCancer  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The theory that holding a radiation-emitting device to your ear for hours could cause cancer certainly feels true, but decades of study has found no link.\n         \n          Scientists have found evidence that high-risk HPV infections can kill men's sperm cells and impair their fertility.\n         \n          Scientists have found that fecal microbiota transplants can improve people's response to cancer immunotherapy.\n         \n          New research suggests GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic can help prevent up to 10 different obesity-related cancers in people with type 2 diabetes.\n         \n          Evidence from a 4,000-year-old skull suggests ancient Egyptian doctors were handy enough to try surgically removing tumors from their patients.\n         \n          The Webb Space Telescope has uncovered a nearby rocky planet with a volatile atmosphere.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

This powerful cordless vacuum featuring an XL capacity is now available for just $399 down from its original price of $599. This markdown is particularly noteworthy as Dyson, much like Apple, is known for its reluctance to offer substantial price reductions on its products. See at Amazon The Dyson Outsize Origin is specifically designed for larger homes and offers an unparalleled cleaning experience that surpasses the capabilities of standard Dyson models. With its 150% larger bin capacity and 25% wider cleaner head, this vacuum allows users to clean more extensively before needing to empty the bin. What sets this deal apart is its unprecedented nature: even during Amazon’s highly anticipated Prime Day event, the Dyson Outsize Origin did not see a price drop of this magnitude. Moreover, this offer is accessible to all Amazon customers, not just Prime members (as it is the case during Prime Day). The Dyson Outsize Origin boasts impressive features that justify its premium status. It offers 90% more power compared to previous models and provides up to 60 minutes of run time to guarantee cleaning sessions without interruption. The vacuum is equipped with three power modes: Auto mode for everyday cleaning, Eco mode for maximum run time, and Boost mode for intensive spot cleaning. On the Outsize Origin, you can also enjoy a great LCD screen which displays power modes, maintenance alerts and remaining run time down to the second. The Auto mode intelligently adapts power based on floor type, optimizing performance and energy efficiency. The Digital Motorbar XL cleaner head is designed to deep clean all floor types and covers more area with each sweep while also de-tangling wrapped long hair and pet hair as you clean. For pet owners, the included Hair screw tool is a game-changer as it can remove long hair and pet hair from various surfaces. Health-conscious consumers will appreciate the advanced whole-machine filtration system which traps 99.99% of particles as small as 0.3 microns, so that the air expelled is cleaner than when it entered the vacuum. This feature is very beneficial for those with allergies or respiratory sensitivities. At this discounted price of $399 (you save $200), the Dyson Outsize Origin is of an exceptional value for those in the market for a high-end, large-capacity cordless vacuum. Also keep in mind that as with many Black Friday deals, especially on premium brands like Dyson, this offer is likely to be time-sensitive and subject to stock availability.

This high-performance storage device originally priced at $549 is available for just $299 which is a substantial 45% discount. See at Amazon Samsung has long been recognized as a leader in SSD technology and the latest T9 model exemplifies why it’s considered the best in the industry. This cutting-edge SSD is engineered to meet the diverse needs of content creators, gaming enthusiasts, academics and professionals. Its standout feature is the blazing-fast data transfer capability and boasts sequential read and write speeds that can reach an impressive 2,000MB/s. The T9’s design philosophy centers on flexibility and broad compatibility. It works seamlessly with a wide array of devices from traditional desktops and laptops to specialized equipment like professional-grade cameras and modern gaming consoles. This versatility is particularly beneficial for professionals who frequently transition between different work environments or need to transfer large datasets across various platforms effortlessly. To complement the hardware, Samsung has included its proprietary Magician Software with the T9. This suite of tools is designed to help users maximize the drive’s potential and offers features such as performance optimization, regular firmware updates, enhanced security options and ongoing health monitoring. This ensures the T9 maintains peak performance and reliability throughout its operational lifespan. The timing of this deal is particularly advantageous. While it originated during Prime Day, Amazon has extended this offer to all customers making it accessible to a broader audience during this weekend. This level of discount on a premium Samsung SSD is rare, and it’s unlikely that we’ll see a better price even during upcoming sales events like Black Friday. Keep in mind that while the deal has been extended for a few more days, it’s still subject to stock availability. Given the popularity of Samsung SSDs and the significant discount being offered, there’s a real possibility that stock could run out quickly.

            "content": "\nThis article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.\n      We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site.\n     Amazon continues to offer an unbeatable deal on the Samsung T9 4TB SSD and extends the exceptional Prime Day pricing to all shoppers, not just Prime members. This high-performance storage device originally priced at $549 is available for just $299 which is a substantial 45% discount. See at Amazon Samsung has long been recognized as a leader in SSD technology and the latest T9 model exemplifies why it’s considered the best in the industry. This cutting-edge SSD is engineered to meet the diverse needs of content creators, gaming enthusiasts, academics and professionals. Its standout feature is the blazing-fast data transfer capability and boasts sequential read and write speeds that can reach an impressive 2,000MB/s. The T9’s design philosophy centers on flexibility and broad compatibility. It works seamlessly with a wide array of devices from traditional desktops and laptops to specialized equipment like professional-grade cameras and modern gaming consoles. This versatility is particularly beneficial for professionals who frequently transition between different work environments or need to transfer large datasets across various platforms effortlessly. To complement the hardware, Samsung has included its proprietary Magician Software with the T9. This suite of tools is designed to help users maximize the drive’s potential and offers features such as performance optimization, regular firmware updates, enhanced security options and ongoing health monitoring. This ensures the T9 maintains peak performance and reliability throughout its operational lifespan. The timing of this deal is particularly advantageous. While it originated during Prime Day, Amazon has extended this offer to all customers making it accessible to a broader audience during this weekend. This level of discount on a premium Samsung SSD is rare, and it’s unlikely that we’ll see a better price even during upcoming sales events like Black Friday. Keep in mind that while the deal has been extended for a few more days, it’s still subject to stock availability. Given the popularity of Samsung SSDs and the significant discount being offered, there’s a real possibility that stock could run out quickly.

            "content": "TikTok has a mess on its hands. The app is the subject of 14 new lawsuits filed on Tuesday by a coalition of state attorneys general. They allege that TikTok harms teens’ mental health with addictive features and also harvests their data without obtaining parental consent. Led by California Attorney General Rob Bonta and New York Attorney General Letitia James, the states’ complaints are sweeping. They say that TikTok violates consumer protection laws by “misleading” users about the efficacy of its time limit and content safety features for users under 18. The litany of complaints also dig into the app for “failing to warn young users about the dangers of its beauty filter” and “misrepresenting that its platform is not directed toward children,” per a joint statement from Bonta and James. The same statement alleges that TikTok violates the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, also known as COPPA, by “actively” monetizing data on users younger than 13 years old. Google and Twitter (now X) have faced somewhat similar complaints. TikTok features described by the officials as addictive include the app’s “around-the-clock notifications” and “endless stream of videos that manipulates users into compulsively spending more time on the platform with no option to disable Autoplay.” In a CNBC interview, D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb called the app “digital nicotine” and said the company was “intentionally trying to addict young people to its platform.” D.C.’s lawsuit additionally calls out TikTok’s built-in “Coins,” reportedly describing the system as “an unlicensed virtual currency.” Reached by Gizmodo over email, TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said the company disagrees with the lawsuits’ claims, “many of which we believe to be inaccurate and misleading.” Hughes went on to say that TikTok has “endeavored to work with the Attorneys General for over two years.” The spokesperson criticized them for suing rather than “work[ing] with us on constructive solutions to industrywide challenges.” While complaints filed on Tuesday focus on TikTok, a statement from New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin argued that Meta has also “purposely” created features to keep kids glued to their devices for “ever-increasing amounts of time.” Platkin said Meta’s behavior was “similar” to TikTok’s in that regard and cited a separate complaint against Meta recently filed by the state. TikTok, owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, is simultaneously fighting the U.S. government over a law that requires the company to either sell the app or face a ban. TikTok has argued the law is unconstitutional and circumvents free speech. The U.S. Department of Justice has also recently taken aim at TikTok, alleging in a separate complaint that TikTok gathers young kids’ private information without parental consent. \nCOPPAMETATikTok  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The visionOS 2.2 developer beta for the Apple Vision Pro finally added ultra-wide Mac mirroring, and it's the most exorbitant, premium way of using a MacBook.\n         \n          The ‘Zero’ AR glasses run web apps and includes self-made lenses.

If you’ve been thinking about making the switch to an electric toothbrush, the Philips Sonicare ProtectiveClean 5300 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is an excellent option, and it’s on sale right now for Prime Day – so naturally, you know it’s time to pounce. See at Amazon Normally retailing for $110, the Philips Sonicare ProtectiveClean 5300 is now available for just $60, offering a substantial savings of $50, or 45% off the regular price. This feature-packed electric toothbrush is designed to help you achieve a healthier, brighter smile for less. And it’s definitely a lot less than the dentist bills you might rack up if you just neglect those teeth, which you should absolutely not be doing. This Philips Sonicare toothbrush has three different modes to choose from: Clean, White, and Gum Care. Whether you’re focused on maintaining your overall oral hygiene, whitening your teeth, or improving your gum health, this toothbrush has you covered, so you can choose the mode that works best for you and go from there. It also boasts a pressure sensor that protects your teeth and gums from excess brushing pressure. The toothbrush also includes a two-minute timer with QuadPacer, which helps you brush for the dentist-recommended amount of time and encourages you to spend equal time in each quadrant of your mouth. Don’t just focus on one area, because the rest of your mouth won’t get clean. If you tend to rush things, this can help you take care of all your teeth, not just one area. With a battery life of up to two weeks, you’ve got plenty of time to use this toothbrush as well. The battery indicator light lets you know when it’s time to recharge, so you’ll never be caught off guard. Just pop it on its base and go, and you’ll be ready whenever it’s time to reach for your brush once more. If you’ve been thinking about getting more serious about taking care of your teeth, don’t wait until they get too bad you have to have a dentist intervene. Not when you can save 45% off this model, which has you covered. Keep in mind that it’s a Prime Day deal as well, so if you want it, snag it before it sells out. You’ll be glad that you did.

Samsung has slashed the price of the 4-terabyte T7 Shield Portable SSD by half — it’s now just $237 on Amazon in a just-dropped Prime Big Deal. This is a perfect drive for content creators, photographers, and videographers who need to store and transfer massive files on a reliable, fast, ultra-portable hard drive. It’s also ideal as an auto-backup drive to sit on your desk, quietly and efficiently keeping your data and files safe and secure. See at Amazon The Samsung T7 Shield is compatible with PCs, Macs, Android devices, and gaming consoles, and also can be used with the iPhone 15 and 16. It’s a simple plug-and-play connection via USB 3.2 Gen 2, able to read and write data at speeds up to a blistering 1,050/1,000 MB per second. That’s nearly twice as fast as the previous-gen Samsung T5. Even at those speeds, the Samsung T7 Shield is amazingly efficient —  files can be edited directly from the drive, and the rubber exterior with Dynamic Thermal Guard keeps the drive from overheating even during massive file transfers. Portable hard drives aren’t always designed to endure the inevitable beatings they take when used on the go, but the T7 Shield has an IP65 rating for dust-resistance and water-resistance and drop resistance of nearly 10 feet. You can transport, carry, and even ship the T7 Shield with the peace of mind that comes from knowing it’s able to take a serious jostling. Your files aren’t just physically safe on the T7 Shield – they’re also encrypted and protected from unauthorized access by Samsung’s Magician software, which also optimized the performance of the drive, monitors its health, and receives and installs important firmware and software updates to keep the drive in prime working condition. If your most valuable files — family photos or videos, or scans of important documents — exist solely on your laptop or desktop drive, you’re courting disaster. Even the best PCs and Macs can suffer catastrophic failure, or be damaged in an accident. You need to have copies of these files in a safe place, and few are safer than the Samsung T7 Shield, which also has more than enough capacity for even massive files. This is a Prime Day deal that will pay for itself many times over even if it just saves you just once from a massive data fail — it’s 53% off right now at Amazon, marked down from $500 to just $237.

It’s a great weekend to get your gift shopping for the upcoming holidays finished or to just treat yourself to some new tech you’ve had your eye on for awhile. Though, if it’s a good deal you’re looking for, you don’t even have to wait for Black Friday this year. StackSocial has a ton of electronics and gadgets on sale for huge discounts right now. Take for example this refurbished Apple MacBook Air. Normally, this would cost you a full $999, but right now you can have it for just $250. That’s a 74% discount. See at StackSocial New is overrated. Like-new is good enough for just about anything and is a great way to save yourself hundreds and hundreds of dollars. What happens to new products anyway? Well I’ll tell you. They become old. It happens to us all. Stop trying to fight the entropy of the universe and just accept things get old. This 2017 Apple MacBook Air has received a refurbished rating of Grade A, or in other words, it’s in near-mint condition. What that means is the body may have some light wear or faint scratches, but nothing that would be visible from more than one foot away. There are no dents, no cracks, and no missing parts. Basically, it’ll look like what a new one would have looked like a couple months in anyway. The screen has no scratches no screen burn. The keyboard and trackpad have been cleaned and are full operational (though may show some slight signs of wear). And the battery should be at a minimum of 80% health. Speaking of battery, that should be granting you all-day battery with 12 hours of fast CPU processing before you need another charge. The display stretches 13.3 inches across with a resolution of 1440p by 900p, and the MacBook is powered by an Intel Core i5 processor to handle all your to-dos and daily tasks and it uses an Intel HD Graphics 6000 to render high-quality images and stream high-definition videos smoothly. Built in is a 128 GB SSD so you can store all your files, photos, and more. Buying this 2017 Apple MacBook Air new would have costed you $999. But by deciding that “basically new” is good enough, you’ll manage to get it for nearly a quarter of the price. StackSocial has the Grade A refurbished MacBook Air for 74% off, bringing the price down to just $250.

Once November hits, everyone will be shifting into full gear for the holiday season. It doesn’t hurt to get ahead of the game a bit —especially if you find a good deal. Last month, Samsung announced a number of new products and upgrades, and we’re already seeing some significant discounts. See at Samsung The durable, outdoorsy Galaxy Watch Ultra is going for $138 off at the moment, but that’s not all. With a trade-in credit from handing in your old watch, you can save an additional $350. That’ll bring the price of the smartwatch down to just $162 — down from $650. For runners, swimmers, cyclists, hikers, and just about anyone who likes to get their workouts done in the great outdoors — this is truly a fitness-first smartwatch. No need to worry if the watch gets tossed or banged around thanks to the tough titanium 47mm face which can handle it no problem. You can even get that titanium in different colors. Choose between titanium gray, titanium white, or titanium silver. Additionally the watch band has a few options to select from as well. A synthetic peakform band, the slightly bulkier marine band, and then the fabric-based trail band. Each are available in orange, white, or black with the exception of the trail band which is only in white or black. Sleep and energy levels can be tracked throughout the day with the Galaxy Watch Ultra, calculating a score of your “physical readiness” based on your sleep from the previous night, heart rate, and steps. The heart rate tracing is precise to help optimize your workouts with the help of Galaxy AI which can filter out the physical movements of your body. You can stay on top of your health by following the personalized Wellness Tips based on insights collected by your Watch and analyzed by your phone daily. Able to hold a charge for up to 60 hours, this battery is super long-lasting. This is great to make sure you have a charge left before starting your workout, but it’s particularly beneficial for sleep tracking. A lot of watches tout what they can while you sleep, but a lot of those smartwatches can’t even last a full day — when do they expect you to charge them? Not a problem with the Galaxy Watch Ultra, which can help you get better rest each night and even detect sleep apnea. The Galaxy Watch Ultra normally goes for $650, but right now with the $138 discount and a trade-in of up to $350, you can get yours for just $162.

            "content": "An E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald’s Quarter Pounders has killed one person and hospitalized 10, according to an announcement Tuesday from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Forty-nine cases have been identified in 10 states, mostly in Colorado and Nebraska, dating from Sept. 27 to Oct. 11. The CDC reports it’s not yet known which specific food ingredient in the hamburgers may have been contaminated with E. coli. McDonald’s has reportedly stopped using fresh slivered onions and quarter-pound beef patties in some states while the investigation into the source of E. coli continues. The CDC notes that quarter-pound beef patties are only used on Quarter Pounders at McDonald’s stores, while fresh slivered onions are “primarily” used by the restaurant chain’s Quarter Pounders and aren’t included on other items. Most people in this outbreak have reportedly eaten Quarter Pounders, according to the CDC, and the theory right now is that the onions are to blame. Of the 49 people who’ve been identified so far in this E. coli outbreak, one person has developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can cause kidney failure. The person who died is an “older adult in Colorado,” though that’s not the person who developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, according to the CDC. Most people infected with E. coli can expect to experience severe stomach cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting about 3-4 days after swallowing the bacteria. While the illnesses identified so far have ranged from Sept. 27 to Oct. 11, there’s a good chance there will be more cases, since it typically takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if someone who’s fallen ill is part of a specific outbreak. The CDC also notes that the true number of sick people will almost certainly be an undercount, given the fact that many people recover without the need for medical care and are never tested. The CDC included a graph in its news release showing when people were reportedly made sick. The public health agency also included a map showing where the cases have shown up geographically. Cases have been reported in Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Oregon, Montana, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, and Wisconsin. The agency also provided demographic information for those who’ve gotten sick, with an age range from 13-88 years old. The median age of those who fell ill is 26. Men have accounted for 63% of those who’ve gotten sick and women are 37% of the current E. coli cases from this outbreak. The CDC says 93% of the people who’ve gotten sick so far are white, and 7% are Black, with no other races represented in the current data. Reached for comment on Tuesday, McDonald’s sent a link to both a written statement and a YouTube video that provides slightly more information that the CDC didn’t note in its own release, including that the slivered onions were “sourced by a single supplier that serves three distribution centers.” McDonald’s said that it takes food safety “extremely seriously” and other beef products, including the cheeseburger, hamburger, Big Mac, McDouble and the double cheeseburger, are unaffected and available while the Quarter Pounder is no longer being sold in some markets. A number of disturbing food recalls have occurred in the U.S. in recent months, including 10 million pounds of meat and poultry from BrucePAC, which produces chicken for a number of different brands and grocery stores across the country, recalled over listeria concerns. Boar’s Head also had a recall over the summer as 10 people were killed and dozens more hospitalized from a listeria outbreak. A major recall in frozen waffles last week over listeria concerns was expanded on Tuesday over fears pancakes and other toaster products may be affected, according to the Associated Press. The recent recalls have also affected products carried by major brands that U.S. consumers regularly rely on, including big grocery retailers like Albertson’s, Aldi, Dollar General, Kroger, Publix, Target, and Walmart, among others. McDonald’s stock price plunged 9% in after-hours trading, according to CNBC. \nCDCe. colihamburgersIllnessMcDonald’squarter pounders  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The illnesses were caused by onions, not the beef.\n         \n          Burger King, KFC, and other chains have pulled onions from their products after a potential source of McDonald's E. coli outbreak was identified.\n         \n          Colorado resident Eric Stelly alleges that he became so sick after eating at McDonald's earlier this month that he had to visit an emergency room.\n         \n          \"I think this was orchestrated by deep state Harris supporters after Trump’s visit to McDonald’s,\" one Trump supporter wrote.\n         \n          The pouches have become a cause célèbre among anti-regulation conservatives, and a growing number of middle and high school students are using them.\n         \n          X has truly become a garbage heap since Trump donor Elon Musk bought the site.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "\nThis article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.\n      We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site.\n     The Ninja Air Fryer, a versatile 10-in-1 cooking powerhouse, has seen its price slashed by 24% bringing it down to an irresistible $159 from its original $209 for Prime Day. This masive discount makes it one of the hottest deals of the first day of Prime Day and it’s likely to disappear faster than you can say “crispy fries.” See at Amazon The Ninja Air Fryer isn’t just another kitchen gadget; it’s a game-changer for home cooks looking to prepare healthier meals without sacrificing flavor. With its innovative DualZone Technology, this air fryer boasts two independent 5-quart baskets, allowing you to cook two different foods simultaneously. This feature alone sets it apart from traditional single-basket air fryers, eliminating the need for back-to-back cooking sessions. One of the popular features of this Ninja XL Air Fryer is its Smart Finish and Match Cook capabilities. The Smart Finish feature lets you cook two different foods using two different methods so that they finish at the same time. Meanwhile, the Match Cook feature allows you to easily copy settings across both zones for when you’re cooking larger portions of the same dish. For those big family meals or when you’re entertaining guests, the XL 10-quart capacity comes in handy. You can whip up a main course and a side dish simultaneously or cook up to 8 pounds of chicken wings with ease. The air fryer’s versatility shines through its 6-in-1 functionality and offers programs for Air Fry, Air Broil, Roast, Keep Warm, Dehydrate and Bake. Health-conscious cooks will appreciate that this Ninja Air Fryer uses up to 75% less fat than traditional deep-frying methods without compromising on that crispy texture we all crave. The wide temperature range of 105°F to 450°F ensures you can tackle a variety of recipes, from delicate dehydrated fruits to perfectly roasted meats. At $159 instead of $209, this Ninja Air Fryer represents exceptional value for money. It’s not just an air fryer; it’s a multi-functional cooking appliance that can replace several kitchen gadgets, saving you both space and money in the long run. However, as with all Prime Day deals, especially on popular items like this, the offer is likely to be short-lived. The combination of the Ninja brand’s reputation for quality, the air fryer’s versatile features, and the significant price drop is sure to make this a fast-selling item.

This high-performance storage device originally priced at $549 is available for just $299 which is a substantial 45% discount. See at Amazon Samsung has long been recognized as a leader in SSD technology and the latest T9 model exemplifies why it’s considered the best in the industry. This cutting-edge SSD is engineered to meet the diverse needs of content creators, gaming enthusiasts, academics and professionals. Its standout feature is the blazing-fast data transfer capability and boasts sequential read and write speeds that can reach an impressive 2,000MB/s. The T9’s design philosophy centers on flexibility and broad compatibility. It works seamlessly with a wide array of devices from traditional desktops and laptops to specialized equipment like professional-grade cameras and modern gaming consoles. This versatility is particularly beneficial for professionals who frequently transition between different work environments or need to transfer large datasets across various platforms effortlessly. To complement the hardware, Samsung has included its proprietary Magician Software with the T9. This suite of tools is designed to help users maximize the drive’s potential and offers features such as performance optimization, regular firmware updates, enhanced security options and ongoing health monitoring. This ensures the T9 maintains peak performance and reliability throughout its operational lifespan. The timing of this deal is particularly advantageous. While it originated during Prime Day, Amazon has extended this offer to all customers making it accessible to a broader audience during this weekend. This level of discount on a premium Samsung SSD is rare, and it’s unlikely that we’ll see a better price even during upcoming sales events like Black Friday. Keep in mind that while the deal has been extended for a few more days, it’s still subject to stock availability. Given the popularity of Samsung SSDs and the significant discount being offered, there’s a real possibility that stock could run out quickly.

The Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) is now at its lowest price yet — just $200 at Amazon, down 28% from its retail price of $280. This huge deal is on the GPS-enabled 44mm Midnight Aluminum case with Midnight Sport Band version of the 2nd Gen Apple Watch SE. And it’s not a retro deal on an old model — the 2nd Gen is the latest and best version of the Apple Watch SE, which makes this $200 Amazon Prime Big Deal Days offer even better. See at Amazon The Apple Watch SE is a superior workout partner, health tracker, and safety device. The watch tracks a wide range of workouts from strength training to Pilates and yoga, and the heart monitor lets you know if your heart rate is unusually high or low. Even your everyday activity like walking and standing are captured by the Apple Watch SE’s Activity Rings, giving you the chance to set and nail goals for yourself. With a water-resistance rating of 50 meters, the Apple Watch SE can even track your swim workouts. And if you’re out on a run or a drive and have an accident, the Apple Watch SE detects a hard fall or car crash and can automatically connect you with emergency services. The Check-In feature will notify a designated friend or family member when you’ve arrived at a destination — the cellular model is perfect for parents keeping an eye on their kids, even if they don’t have their own iPhone. The Sleep app is one of the Apple Watch SE’s best features. You can create a bedtime schedule to help ensure you’re getting enough rest, and even as you sleep the Apple Watch SE can track your different sleep stages like REM, Core, and Deep Sleep. You don’t see Apple devices getting the big-sale treatment very often, even on Amazon, so this Prime Big Deal offering the 2nd Gen Apple Watch SE (GPS-enabled 44mm Midnight Aluminum case) for an all-time low price of $200 — 28% below the usual retail price of $280 — should be at the top of your Prime Big Deal Days shopping list.

The New York City Marathon is this Sunday. Racers from around the globe will be hitting foot to pavement across all five boroughs of the greatest city on Earth. Maybe you are one, know one, or strive to be one some day. Whether you’re gearing up for these 26.2 miles in a few days or just one or two in the morning before work, you need yourself a good running watch. Amazon has the Garmin Epix for 44% off right now. That’s a $400 discount, bringing the price down to just $500 for a limited time. See at Amazon This second generation smartwatch is built for athletic lifestyles. The large 1.3-inch AMOLED display is always on, so you can see it clearly whether in total darkness or with the high noon sun reflecting right off of it. Each watch is made with a sapphire display with a titanium bezel to withstand getting tossed and banged around on occasion. As any good smartwatch does, the Garmin Epix has built-in GPS. While GPS is on, battery life can las up to 30 hours when in always-on mode. if you set it to gesture mode, as in the display only turns on when you position your wrist to look at it, the watch will last up to 42 hours. When not using GPS, the battery can last up to five days in always-on mode or a staggering sixteen days in gesture-mode. This puts smartwatches like the Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch to shame, which need to charge every day or two. While the watch of course has all sorts of performance metrics and features to gain better insight into your long runs and workouts on the track, the Garmin Epix is built for all kinds of sports. You can even take it to the slopes to view preloaded SkyView maps for over 2,000 ski resorts worldwide. During the day while you’re not working out or engaged in physical activity, the Garmin Epix fills the need of a standard smartwatch, sending you notifications to keep you connected with friends, family, and colleagues. And with 24/7 health monitoring, you can begin to understand your body better than ever before. The Garmin Epix second generation GPS smart watch is typically $900. Right now, you can grab one for just $500 — a staggering 44% discount. And if you plan on running the NYC marathon this Sunday, I bet if you order it right this second with Prime, there’s a good chance you can get it on time.

            "content": "We live in a world where life-threatening weather events are becoming more common and severe. As Category 4 storm Hurricane Milton barrels towards Florida, it is likely to bring winds of more than 110 miles per hour and storm surges of 10 feet or more. Federal agencies expect widespread devastation and potential loss of life from those unwilling or unable to evacuate. Even if you’re not in Milton’s path, now’s the time to acquaint yourself with several emergency satellite connections available to users on the latest iPhones or Google Pixels. This year, with the Pixel 9, Google introduced Emergency Satellite SOS. If you were lucky enough to upgrade, you can access the new service for free. The most important thing to note about satellite connectivity is that the companies recommend you’re in clear view of the sky, which could be a hazard in a deadly storm. The National Weather Service says wind speeds of over 75 miles per hour can break glass or destroy roofs. It’s best to consider your phone’s satellite connectivity a last resort when everything else has failed. 10AM EDT #Milton Position Update: Ensure you are in your safe location before the onset of strong winds or possible flooding. Stay up to date at https://t.co/tW4KeGe9uJ pic.twitter.com/3SL0QH9V8H — National Hurricane Center (@NHC_Atlantic) October 9, 2024  You may also read that Apple claims Emergency SOS via satellite is free for two years after you first activate your iPhone. However, Apple has continuously pushed back the date for the end of free connectivity, so even if you bought the iPhone 14 at launch, you should still have the feature on board. Currently, it’s up to every individual Android maker to create their own satellite connectivity. If you don’t have any of the necessary devices, there are other options. Motorola sells a Defy satellite communicator that can work with either iPhones or Android. Otherwise, there are many options for satellite communicators that range from $200 to $600 from companies like Garmin with products like the InReach Messenger. We also recommend downloading the FEMA app on iOS or Android. This will give you access to data about shelters. For iPhone users, you’ll need any iPhone 14, iPhone 15, or iPhone 16 to access Apple’s satellite SOS features. You’ll also want to be on iOS 16.4 and preferably iOS 18. Usually, the feature works in case of a fall or car collision to alert emergency services or roadside assistance automatically. While this has caused the occasional public kerfuffle, including services being called on public concerts, the feature has undoubtedly saved lives. When you call 911 on your iPhone 14 or later, you can call regularly with available networks, not just your own. If it fails to connect, you can use Emergency Text via satellite. This will allow you to contact emergency services via text. You need to hit Report Emergency, then answer the on-screen prompts. Apple says it may take around 30 seconds to send a message under a clear sky, though it may take longer if walls or trees are in the way. Either way, it’s best to stay on the screen once connected so you can make sure your message gets sent and you can see any response. Alternatively, you can text emergency services or other contacts directly with satellite messages. If you want to access satellite features immediately, you can go through the Control Center by swiping down from the top right corner of your phone. Then tap the Cellular button on the right, which looks like a small antenna. After that, choose Satellite and Emergency SOS via satellite. If you don’t have any WiFi or carrier service, the Messages app should also prompt you to use Messages via Satellite. If you’re messaging friends not on iPhone, it will default to SMS, according to Apple. We should also mention that iOS 18 has the option for live video calling with emergency services. This only works with participating U.S. operators and requires a good internet connection. You need to do some setup to ensure you provide as much information as possible to emergency responders. That includes establishing a Medical ID in Apple’s Health app. This allows the phone to contact loved ones in case you need to reach emergency services. First, enter the Health App, click on your profile picture, and tap Medical ID. Then, after establishing some basic facts, you’re automatically taken to a page allowing you to share your medical ID during an emergency call. This can include pertinent information, such as any medications you’re taking or allergies on your lock screen for when first responders find you. You can also add more Emergency Contacts straight from your Contacts list and onto your Medical ID. If your friends use an iPhone, your phone should send a transcript of your conversation with emergency services and a map of your location through iMessage. If they have Android, the emergency contacts will get a text message instead of the number 767911. Your emergency contacts must respond “YES” before receiving your name, location, and transcript provided to emergency services. To access any of Google’s satellite services, you’ll need a Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, or Pixel 9 Pro Fold. They are the only Android phones currently with Google’s specific satellite features. The feature also currently doesn’t work in Alaska or Hawaii. You also need to use Google Messages to use the satellite messaging. You’ll want to make sure you have emergency contacts established on your phone who will receive notifications of your status and location. Use the Personal Safety app to set up contacts. This app also offers real-time location sharing via WiFi or carrier connection and GPS status sharing. Like the iPhone, you can call 911 with your regular phone app. If that fails, you’ll see an option to dial with Satellite SOS. Hit that button, then Use Satellite SOS, then Start. Users then need to fill out a series of questions to help notify emergency responders about their status. You’ll be asked if you want to notify your emergency contacts, and you should probably do so with the Notify button. Google will then ask you to follow on-screen prompts to position your phone. As we noted before, being outside or standing in front of a window during hurricane-speed winds is dangerous, so we advise using a satellite connection as a last resort and to be as safe as possible. It may take some time to send a long message via satellite and receive a response. Google says this may take a few minutes. \nAppleEmergency SOSGoogleHurricane Milton  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The iOS 18.2 beta has a ton of awesome features you can try right now, like the Image Playground app and upgraded writing tools.\n         \n          The ‘Zero’ AR glasses run web apps and includes self-made lenses.

            "content": "It’s Prime Day deja vu. Once again, we’ve returned to the halls of Amazon’s warehouses for the online retail giant’s ultimate deal-a-thon. Now that we get Prime Day twice a year, we’re doubly inundated with awful deals for products we want and slashed prices for junk we certainly do not want. Here at Gizmodo, we like to remind consumers that you don’t necessarily need to shop on Amazon to get good deals. Hell, you don’t need to shop on Prime Day, either. Best Buy, Walmart, and other big box shops regularly put hot-ticket items on sale around the same time. Not to mention that Black Friday is on the horizon, and we suspect many of the products on sale now will have similar discounts at the tail end of November. As usual, we find companies inflating the prices of their products to make the deals seem more dramatic. While you may certainly find a few hundred dollars off that phone you’ve wanted all year, we’re here to remind you not to fall for any “exclusive”-seeming deals. Always check price-checking apps and sites like camelcamelcamel for recent pricing history. Remember, if that smartwatch went for cheaper in the past, it would likely hit the same price again. We have a separate guide for helping you spot a bad Amazon deal yourself, but if you need more advice for Prime Day shopping, you can find it here.  Amazon is chock full of personal health products. On the last prime day, we found an ice tub claiming it was going 90% off (even though, in reality, it was only $20 on sale). The LifePro Sauna Blanket advertises its “Prime Big Deal” is taking it from $200 to $150. What you get is a large sleeping bag with slots for your arms. It even comes with a large thermal wrap to cover your body for extra heating. It looks like a good option for those who ever wanted to feel like a steamed clam at the bottom of a pot. The $150 price is lower than where the product usually goes. Normal sales prices typically take it to around $170. And if that’s not enough, there’s even more. This “Personal Sauna” from the company Sunakie may be the most awkward way possible to sweat yourself into better health. The company claims it gets hot in just 10 minutes, and you can still look at your phone thanks to zip-open arm sleeves and a hole in the top for your head. The Mets are finally in the playoffs, and since it’s been a while for some fans, they may not be used to the feeling of chilly stadium seats going into late autumn. You could dress warmly for the weather or grab a heated massage stadium seat that warms your buns and makes you take over an inordinate amount of room on the bench. It supposedly folds up enough to take it around as a backpack, but it’s the most outlandish piece of bleacher tech you may be afraid to stand up to grab a beer. The seat is $88 now, down from a typical $110. The real question for any potential customers is whether your warm butt is so important you take over two or three seats on the bleachers. You should check if your local sports venue allows you to bring an outside seat warmer. I know many folks who took part in “Caging” their friend’s room with actor Nicolas Cage’s mug. I also have a lot of experience with “reversible” sequin pillows, and I can tell you straight up that this Nicolas Cage Sequin Pillow Cover certainly isn’t worth it for just $3 off its base $15 price. Those sequins often get stuck in the wrong position, meaning you have to manually fix them and potentially break the strings holding them in place. Plus, they’re just uncomfortable, not the least, because you’re literally sitting on Cage’s crazed eyes and shining white teeth. The last time I talked about Prime on Prime Day was in 2023. Since then, the drink company and the brand’s main face, controversial influencer Logan Paul, have been inundated with lawsuits for lagging sales and failing to pay vendors for the ingredients used in the drink. So, should you jump the gun for a 24-pack of Prime drinks for a mere $18? Not so fast. The product normally goes for just $23, making the savings a mere $5. It’s one thing to buy color-coordinating clothes for your family during the holidays; it’s another to get matching Halloween pajamas sporting a mass of skulls. Listen, if your family is truly the goth band you’ve always wanted, you probably don’t require matching leggings. The Transwarrior-brand electric compressed air duster claims its fan goes 300,000 RPM with a 300G wind pressure. If that’s true, then why, oh why, does the company’s main image advertising its product include somebody sticking the product directly at their face? You probably don’t need gale-force winds to blow the dust out of your case, and any compressed air can do the trick. This duster is selling for $60 with an outlandish 91% off a claimed $700 base price. Yes, as you can guess, that’s absolute bullshit. The blower normally sells for around $85. Amazon is advertising many kinds of console sticker covers for Prime Day, but one that caught my eye, unfortunately, was this Xbox Series S and Xbox One cover. It made me so uncomfortable that I debated censoring the image. It’s a whole $2 off the original price, advertising a “limited-time deal” that seems like the quickest way to ensure anybody visiting your home stops talking to you immediately. I get it. Some older folk still don’t understand that you don’t have to buy physical software keys for security software. However, Norton and its owner, Gen Digital, are still pushing the ridiculous notion that you can get an amazing deal for Norton 360 antivirus for $20. However, as you might expect, the company’s antivirus normally costs an average of $30, not $90. This means the deal may net you $10 off for a pre-paid year-long subscription. \nAmazonPrime Day  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          BioWare veteran Michael Gamble will serve as the series' executive producer.\n         \n          Hundreds of employees signed a letter criticizing Amazon's 'non-data-driven' reasoning for ending hybrid work.

            "content": "Some of the most diverse environments in the world can be found right in our bathrooms—virally speaking. Scientists swabbed people’s toothbrushes and showerheads and found them brimming with hundreds of different viruses, many of which have never been discovered until now. Thankfully, though, these bacteria-hunting viruses aren’t dangerous to people. The world is filled with countless viruses, bacteria, and other microscopical life. While the vast majority of these microbes pose no threat to humans, many can provide us important lessons about their surroundings and some might even have practical applications, such as showing us new ways to fend off bad germs. So scientists are always interested in cataloging previously unknown microbial neighborhoods, also called microbiomes. “Toothbrushes and showerheads harbor phage that are unlike anything we’ve seen before.” Researchers at Northwestern led this new study, published Wednesday in the journal Frontiers in Microbiomes. The research is an extension of their previous project, nicknamed Operation Pottymouth. The scientists intially wanted to study unexplored bacterial microbiomes close to home. “There is so much about the world around us that we don’t understand—including the things that may seem familiar. We started out looking at things like toothbrushes and showerheads because they are important sources of microbes that we’re exposed to, but we don’t know which microbes they carry or what factors influence them. Our original studies identified a bunch of bacteria, which is in and of itself super interesting,” lead researcher Erica Hartmann, a microbiologist and associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Northwestern’s McCormick School of Engineering, told Gizmodo. “But the ‘next frontier’ of microbiology is phage. There are so many phage out there, and we know so little about them. So we decided to start just by looking at what’s around us.” This time, Hartmann and her team analyzed the viruses living inside our toothbrush and showerhead bacteria, a group of viruses known as bacteriophages. They unearthed an immense amount of phage in their samples, tallying over 600 viruses in total. There were no clear patterns among the viruses they found, but phage that infect mycobacteria did tend to be a bit more common. Some mycobacteria are known to cause serious diseases in humans, such as leprosy and tuberculosis. “Toothbrushes and showerheads harbor phage that are unlike anything we’ve seen before. Not only did we find different phage on toothbrushes and showerheads, we found different phage on each toothbrush and each showerhead,” Hartmann said. “This amount of diversity is huge, and it isn’t because of anything specific to toothbrushes or showerheads. There are just so many phage out there waiting to be discovered.” Bacteriophages are, as their name suggests, a problem for bacteria, not people. But we’ve started to study and deploy phages as treatments for our bacterial infections, particularly bacteria that have evolved to resist antibiotics. So it’s certainly possible that scientists like Hartmann will be able to discover something medically useful from the phage or other microbes that her team has discovered in our bathrooms. But even the discovery alone is worthwhile, she adds. “It could be that the next great antibiotic will be based on something that grew on your toothbrush. Even if this doesn’t lead to some great new technology, it’s important to observe and record the diversity of phage because it expands our fundamental understanding of biology,” she says. Given how little we know about phage and other microbes, the researchers plan to continue sampling all sorts of environments—both familiar and exotic—to further map out their worlds. They’re also developing new methods to better observe them and how they work. “This will give us a fuller picture of what types of microbes we all encounter in our everyday lives and potentially lead to new discoveries and inventions to better protect human and environmental health,” Hartmann said. \nBacteriaViruses  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Researchers have uncovered a new virus in a mouse caught by one of the scientists' pets, sparking concerns about possible spillover to humans.\n         \n          Flu season is right around the corner, and there's no better time than now to keep yourself from getting sick for the holidays.\n         \n          The odd discovery provides new insights into ancient dairy practices and the origin of kefir.\n         \n          A recent study examining 30 microwave ovens discovered nearly 750 different species of bacteria, some of which are considered harmful to humans.\n         \n          Known as rustrela virus, the deadly germ causes a neurological illness in cats called staggering disease.\n         \n          A man recently contracted flesh eating bacteria while walking barefoot on a beach, highlighting an upsetting list of diseases you can catch this summer.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "We might soon have a way to prevent one of the world’s most debilitating and hard-to-treat infections in the world. Scientists are developing a cutting-edge vaccine that could stop Clostridioides difficile—a bacteria known for causing severe gut infections—in its tracks. Scientists detailed their development of an experimental vaccine candidate for C. difficile bacteria, better known as C. diff, in new research this week. The vaccine is based on the same mRNA technology used to create some of the first widely available covid-19 vaccines. While many people carry C. diff in their guts without issue, the bacteria can sometimes grow out of control, triggering diarrhea and colitis (a common trigger for this is antibiotic use, since the drugs can kill off harmless bacteria that keep C. diff in check). Antibiotics can treat these initial infections, but about one in six people will then experience recurrent bouts of C. diff that often prove even harder to clear. So scientists have long hoped to find a way to short circuit this miserable cycle from happening in the first place, such as through an effective vaccine. Woman Gets New Cat—and Months of Diarrhea, in Possible Medical First Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) developed the vaccine candidate, which leverages mRNA technology to target C. diff at different key points. These bacteria can shapeshift and use a variety of tricks to ensure their survival. They can turn into long-lasting spores that bide their time hiding in the soil, for instance, or combine en masse into a hardy biofilm in our guts that allow them to resist antibiotics. Pathogenic C. diff strains also produce toxins that make it easier for them to continue growing but at the cost of sickening us. The team’s vaccine is intended to train our immune system against several toxins and other virulence factors of C. diff that make it such a menace. So far, their plan appears to be working as hoped, at least in mice. The vaccine provided mice long-lasting protection against both the primary and recurrent forms of C. diff infection, the researchers found. They also tested an upgraded version of the vaccine, designed to help the body recognize non-toxin cellular and spore antigens of C. diff, and found that it improved the mice’s ability to clear toxin-producing bacteria from the gut. The team’s findings were published this month in the journal Science. “Our approach was to create a multivalent mRNA vaccine that would attack multiple aspects of C. diff’s complex lifestyle simultaneously without affecting the normal microbiota,” said co-lead author Mohamad-Gabriel Alameh, an assistant professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Penn and a senior principal scientist at CHOP, in a statement from the university. This research is still in the early stages of development, of course, so it’s no guarantee that the team’s vaccine will work just as well in people. But a C. diff vaccine, if successfully developed, would have a tremendous health impact. It’s estimated that nearly half a million C. diff infections occur in the U.S. every year, which can be especially dangerous and sometimes deadly for already vulnerable populations, such as elderly people or those in the hospital for other conditions. Annually, it’s thought around 30,000 people die from C. diff every year. Recent research shows that C. diff is becoming more of a problem outside of hospitals, too. It will likely take years for this vaccine to reach large-scale trials even if things continue to go well. But the future overall is already looking bright for mRNA-based vaccines. Following the rollout of the covid-19 vaccines, Moderna’s mRNA vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration just this past May. mRNA vaccines for cytomegalovirus, the flu, and some cancers are now close to fruition as well. \nc diffvaccines  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Trump said Robert F.

            "content": "More than 50 years after Apollo, astronauts will be returning to the Moon in style. Axiom Space, NASA’s commercial partner, unveiled the final look of its designer spacesuits built for exploring the lunar surface. During the International Astronautical Congress, Axiom revealed the flight design of its next generation suit, designed in partnership with luxury brand Prada. The company showed off its Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit (AxEMU) without the dark layer that covered the spacesuit when it was first revealed over a year ago. Instead, the suit’s final form is that familiar white material that reflects heat and protects astronauts from lunar dust. In 2022, NASA tasked Axiom Space with developing the first moonwalking spacesuits since the Apollo missions, which will be worn by astronauts on the lunar surface as part of the space agency’s Artemis program. Less than a year later, Axiom Space unveiled the AxEMU spacesuit under its initial $228.5 million contract. The first look at the AxEMU spacesuits featured a dark cover layer used to conceal its proprietary technology. The final flight design shows off all the different capabilities of the suit, including an onboard health monitoring system for the astronauts, a cooling system, coatings on the helmet and visor to enhance astronauts’ view of their surroundings, and pressure garments, according to Axiom Space. Spacesuits, Ranked The next generation spacesuits are designed to give astronauts more range of motion and enhanced safety while exploring the lunar surface, and it is designed with more sizing and adjustability options to fit a wide range of people. AxEMU was developed to reflect the legacy of NASA spacesuits while incorporating new technology, more mobility, and better protection from the lunar environment. It’s been a long time coming, with the current design worn by NASA astronauts dating back to more than 40 years ago. With its flight design finally revealed, the modern, sleek look of the AxEMU spacesuit came through. Axiom Space partnered with Prada to draw on the brand’s expertise on design and material, while also trying to provide an aesthetically pleasing look for the astronauts on the Moon. “I’m very proud of the result we’re showing today…We’ve shared our expertise on high-performance materials, features, and sewing techniques, and we learned a lot,” Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada Group’s chief marketing officer, said in a statement. The AxEMU spacesuit is made to be worn by astronauts on NASA’s Artemis 3 mission, which is set to launch in September 2026. The suit is “nearing the final development stage,” according to Axiom Space, having completed a pressurized simulation with NASA and SpaceX for the Artemis 3 mission. “We are pioneering a new era in space exploration where partnerships are imperative to the commercialization of space,” Russell Ralston, executive vice president of Extravehicular Activity at Axiom Space, said in a statement. “For the first time, we are leveraging expertise in other industries to craft a better solution for space.”   \nArtemisAxiom SpaceNASAspacesuit  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Vega provided the first telescopic evidence of a disk of planet-forming material, but there are no planets to be found around this star.\n         \n          The four astronauts were hospitalized after returning from an eight-month stay on board the ISS.\n         \n          The space station is getting closer to retirement, and it's still in need of a deorbiting vehicle to lower it to its fiery death.\n         \n          Instead of relying on fasteners to keep structures together in space, astronauts may need to use lasers to weld on the lunar surface.\n         \n          The spunky probe's final gravity assist around Venus will put it on track to break records near the Sun next month.\n         \n          A crew of astronauts was recently hospitalized following a return to Earth on board SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "The USDA posted a recall notice on its website Wednesday for “9,986,245 pounds of ready-to-eat (RTE) meat and poultry products that may be adulterated,” with listeria. The meat was produced by Oklahoma-based BrucePac, but if you’re wondering how to avoid those products, you’re out of luck at the moment. The recall doesn’t give any specific product names to avoid. BrucePac’s website says it makes “custom-crafted, pre-cooked proteins for top brands in Retail, leading foodservice operators, and other channels.” But it’s not clear what consumers should be looking out for to steer clear of these products. And USDA’s recall doesn’t provide any more clarity aside from noting the products “bear establishment numbers ‘51205 or P-51205’ inside or under the USDA mark of inspection.” The different brands that BrucePac produces meat for include Urban Bruce and City Grillers, according to the company’s website, though it’s not clear if those specific brands include recalled meat. The company’s website also notes production of meat for private labels, meaning there could be other brands at retailers with listeria but we simply don’t know what those are at the moment. The food was produced from June 19, 2024 to October 8, 2024, according to the USDA, which is notable because that end date was just yesterday. Gizmodo reached out to both USDA and BrucePac in an attempt to learn more about what products might be impacted by the recall but didn’t immediately hear back.[Update: USDA has finally posted a list of recalled products that’s hundreds of pages long. And it’s still being updated.] Thankfully, the recall notes that there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions from consumption of the recalled products. But it’s still not clear how the average consumer might be able to protect themselves if they don’t have more information about what products are actually being recalled. The listeria was only discovered after USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) performed “routine product testing” of poultry products produced by BrucePac and they came back positive for Listeria monocytogenes. “FSIS is concerned that some product may be available for use in restaurants, institutions, and other establishments. These other establishments may have used affected meat and poultry in RTE products that may be on store shelves or in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers,” the recall posted to the USDA recall reads. “Restaurants, institutions, and other establishments are urged not to serve or use these products. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase,” the recall continues. Listeria is a serious problem that can cause severe illness in medically vulnerable and pregnant people. Boar’s Head recently issued a recall of over 7 million pounds of meat after listeria was detected. That listeria outbreak has caused at least 59 hospitalizations in 19 states and has killed 10 people, according to the CDC. Top Democrats have even called for a criminal investigation as Boar’s Head has shut down one meat plant in Virginia permanently and promised to institute stricter health and safety measures. Gizmodo will update this post if we hear back from the USDA or BrucePac to get clarity on what meat and poultry products consumers should avoid. \nFSISlisteriausda  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The CDC warns it can take 10 weeks for some people to develop symptoms from listeria.\n         \n           \n         \n           \n         \n           \n         \n           \n         \n           \n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

If you’ve been building out a new gaming PC or hoping to play even more games on your PlayStation 5, storage capacity is going to be of high concern. It’s something most of us would be very happy of which to have no upper limit. Unfortunately, that will not ever be the case in our lifetime. Though you can boost your storage quite a bit without breaking the bank. Amazon has the WD_Black SN850X NVMe Internal Gaming SSD for up to 56% off. That brings the price down to just $310. See at Amazon You’ll get read and write speeds of up to 7,300 MB/s on this fourth generation SSD — perfect for high-end computing and heavy duty workstations and, of course, your elite gaming setup. Gamers will find themselves with ridiculously short load times and top-tier performance. And at 4TB,  you can say goodbye to having to keep uninstalling older games just to make room for the new ones. Install the WD_Black Dashboard on your Windows PC and you’ll be able to monitor your drive’s health as well as mess around the the RGB lighting customization. Gamers know it wouldn’t be a true gaming rig unless it lights up in different colors. The WD_Black SSD boasts a powerful suite of features like Predictive Loading, Overhead Balancing, and Adaptive Thermal Management. All of these work together to keep your SSD performance high for fast load times and file transfer. See at Amazon For the console players out there, the version with a heatsink is also on discounted. A heatsink is crucial for SSD use on a console. It’s basically a piece of metal that can dissipate the heat from the device. This stabilizes its temperature and can help eliminate performance issues. Crucially, this means you can use it with your PlayStation 5. A standard PlayStation 5 only has a 825GB drive. And on top of that, a some of that space is used toward the core system files. That leaves the player with roughly 667.2GB of usable storage for game installations. But, you can expand that with an SSD with a heatsink. Unfortunately, the 4TB WD_BLACK with heatsink is still listed at its full price. However, the 1TB SSD is seeing a 31% discount right now, coming in at $90. If that’s still too small for you, the 2TB version is 19% off discount. That’s more than tripling your storage capacity for just $162. If PS5 is not your forte and you’re only looking for something to plug into a PC without the heatsink, the standard WD_Black 4TB SN850X NVMe Internal Gaming SSD is down 56%. You’ll save almost $400 on all that space a be ready to download a ton more games.

The sales event is exclusive to Amazon Prime members, so unless you are a subscriber, you won’t be able to access these holiday doorbusters and deep discounts on top-rated products. If you are not a Prime member, that’s not the end of the world. See at Samsung Tons of other retailers have also kicked off their holiday deals because they know everyone is searching for deals online this week — and Samsung is no different. Right now, Samsung has the durable, outdoorsy Galaxy Watch Ultra going for $50 off. That’s not all though. With a trade-in credit from handing in your old watch, you can save an additional $350. That’ll bring the price of the smartwatch down to just $250 — down from $650. This is a fitness-first smartwatch. For runners, swimmers, cyclists, hikers, and just about anyone who likes to get their workouts done in the great outdoors. The tough titanium 47mm face can handle being tossed or banged around. And that titanium is available in different colors. You can choose between titanium gray, titanium white, or titanium silver. Additionally the watch band has a few options to select from as well. A synthetic peakform band, the slightly bulkier marine band, and then the fabric-based trail band. Each are available in orange, white, or black with the exception of the trail band which is only in white or black. The Galaxy Watch Ultra makes it easy to track your energy level throughout the day, calculating a score of your “physical readiness” based on your sleep from the previous night, heart rate, and steps. The heart rate tracing is precise to help optimize your workouts with the help of Galaxy AI which can filter out the physical movements of your body. You can stay on top of your health by following the personalized Wellness Tips based on insights collected by your Watch and analyzed by your phone daily. The battery is super long-lasting — able to hold a charge for up to 60 hours. This is great to make sure you have a charge left before starting your workout, but it’s particularly beneficial for sleep tracking. A lot of watches tout what they can while you sleep, but a lot of those smartwatches can’t even last a full day — when do they expect you to charge them? Not a problem with the Galaxy Watch Ultra, which can help you get better rest each night and even detect sleep apnea. The Galaxy Watch Ultra normally goes for $650, but right now with the $50 discount and a trade-in of up to $350, you can get yours for just $250.

            "content": "No doubt about it, UTIs suck. They burn, they itch, they come back just when you think you’re in the clear. But for those dealing with these relentless infections, there’s finally a new line of defense. A new type of antibiotic is now available for some of the most annoying infections around. This month, the Food and Drug Administration approved Iterum Therapeutics’ Orlynvah for certain kinds of urinary tract infections that aren’t likely to respond to other drugs. UTIs are some of the most common infections that people encounter, particularly women. About 60% of women in the U.S. are estimated to experience at least one uncomplicated UTI (a UTI with no signs of structural damage or other health conditions) in their lifetime. While UTIs were once easily treatable with just about any simple course of antibiotics, many infections nowadays are resistant to at least one or more front-line drugs used against them. This added hardiness not only makes it harder to treat UTIs early before they cause more serious trouble, but also increases the risk of having recurrent UTIs. So scientists have been desperate to find newer antibiotics that can treat these resistant infections. Orlynvah is the first drug of its kind. It contains a combination of sulopenem etzadroxil, which belongs to a subclass of antibacterials called penems, and probenecid, a renal tubular transport inhibitor that has been used in the past to boost the duration of antibiotics in our body. Penems are synthetic antibiotics that has shown great promise in treating a wide variety of commonly resistant germs, but Orlynvah is the first ever oral penem to be approved in the U.S. The drug has been approved to treat certain uncomplicated UTIs caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Proteus mirabilis bacteria. Importantly, Orlynvah is intended for people who have limited or no other alternative oral antibacterial options for their UTIs, such as infections that haven’t responded to past treatment or infections that show clear resistance to other drugs through testing. The FDA approved Orlynvah on the basis of two Phase III trials, which found that it outperformed or matched the effectiveness of other standard antibiotics for uncomplicated UTIs, including resistant infections. “The FDA approval of sulopenem is tremendous news for those of us who have been hoping for a new option to treat appropriate at-risk patients suffering from UTIs,” said Marjorie Golden, an infectious disease specialist at the St. Raphael Campus of Yale New Haven Hospital who was involved in the drug’s clinical research, in a statement from Iterum. “Based on the totality of clinical data generated, sulopenem has the potential to be an important treatment alternative for use in the community.” As valuable as Orlynvah will be for doctors and patients, the drug isn’t a cure-all for UTIs in general. The drug failed to pass clinical trials testing its effectiveness against complicated UTIs or complicated intra-abdominal infections. And like many newer antibacterial drugs, its use will be carefully managed to delay the emergence of bacterial strains that evolve resistance to it. Still, Orlynvah should be able to prevent plenty of UTI-related misery. While these infections aren’t always apparent, they can cause pelvic pain, frequent and/or burning urination, and even blood in urine. Left untreated, UTIs can also raise the risk of a more serious kidney infection, a narrowed urethra in men, and even sepsis (a life-threatening inflammation that can cause widespread organ damage). \nantibiotic resistancedrug approvalsSuperbugsUTIs  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          On Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration approved Cobenfy, a drug from Bristol Myers Squibb—the first truly novel treatment for schizophrenia in decades.\n         \n          A new report is the latest to show that superbugs will become an increasingly deadly threat to our public health.\n         \n          Two large-scale phase III trials have found that Bayer's elinzanetant can safely and effectively reduce hot flashes, paving the road to FDA approval.\n         \n          Scientists in Singapore say they've discovered a sixth major clade of Candida auris, an emerging and often drug-resistant fungal threat.\n         \n          The WHO is urging countries to track hardy strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae that can severely sicken anyone.\n         \n           \n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

What’s more, these deals are now accessible to everyone, including non-Prime members, which makes it an ideal time for everyone to take advantage of significant savings. See all deals at Amazon US See all deals at Amazon UK Top deals for Tuesday: See all deals at Amazon Despite the official end of Prime Day (Oct. 8-9), Amazon keeps on offering massive discounts across a wide range of products. You’ll be pleased to find that popular Apple items are still available at reduced prices: the AirPods Pro 2 remain priced at $199 ($50 reduction from their original $249 price tag). Similarly, the 9th generation iPad is still 32% off and a 4-pack of AirTags can still be snagged for $79. Amazon’s own lineup of devices continues to see price cuts. Echo speakers and Ring security cameras are still available with discounts ranging from 40% to 70%. This extended sale period also encompasses a variety of other product categories, including audio equipment from premium brands like Sony and Bose. Home appliances and gaming consoles such as the PS5 Standard and Digital Edition remain part of the deal roster. Additionally, a range of beauty products and toys are still available at discounted rates on this Tuesday, one week after Prime Day. See all deals at Amazon Lego enthusiasts have not been left out of this extended promotional period of Prime Day: the Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar continues to be available at a 20% discount (top seller on the platform) which makes it an attractive option for those looking to add a touch of galactic fun to their holiday countdown. The Lego Harry Potter Castle is now priced at $135 down from its original $169 and it is also very popular. While Amazon extends its promotional period, other retailers are not sitting idle. Samsung is offering significant discounts on its latest technology through its official store. This includes special deals and trade-in offers on new Galaxy S24 smartphones and the Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 foldable models, with potential savings exceeding $1,000 for trade-ins. As this extension of Prime Day deals continues, stock levels for very popular items are becoming a concern. High-demand products like the MacBook Pro, AirPods Max and certain headphone models from Beats and Bose have already sold out. You should act quickly as some more might run out of stock by the end of the day. In a departure from the typical Prime Day format, these extended deals are now accessible to all shoppers regardless of Prime membership status. This democratization of discounts provides an good opportunity for non-Prime members to enjoy savings reserved for subscribers. While this extended Prime Day sale period offers substantial savings, Black Friday is on the horizon. Savvy shoppers might consider this an opportunity to get a head start on holiday shopping and potentially avoid the rush and stock issues often associated with Black Friday sales.

            "content": "There’s a joke in The Departed that you should treat Feds like they’re mushrooms: Feed them excrement, and keep them in the dark. The same sentiment has been expressed towards journalists, which is fitting, since at least some of us are fun guys. (Don’t go away, no more puns, I promise). Scientists have now applied this idea to plants, suggesting they can grow in conditions once thought impossible. Chemists at several universities, including the University of California, Riverside, looked at the process of photosynthesis, in which plants convert sunlight into the sugar they use to fuel their growth, and decided it may be too inefficient to keep up with the growing human demand for food. In the journal Joule, they wrote that climate change and population growth are pushing humanity to develop better ways to grow crops that aren’t dependent on the Sun. To that end, the team devised a new agricultural method, which they say bypasses conventional photosynthesis, and could be a part of the solution to the global problem of food insecurity. An AI Analysis of 500,000 Studies Shows How We Can End World Hunger “If we don’t need to grow plants with sunlight anymore, then we can decouple agriculture from the environment and grow food in indoor, controlled environments,” said Robert Jinkerson, an associate professor of chemical environmental engineering at the University of California, Riverside, who led the research, in a press release. “I think that we need to move agriculture into the next phase of technology, and producing it in a controlled way that is decoupled from nature has to be the next step.” The problem with photosynthesis, from a human perspective, is that plants convert very little of the light they absorb into chemical energy. By finding ways to artificially improve that number, farmers would be able to vastly increase their yield, without requiring more resources, or producing more greenhouse gas emissions. While electro-agriculture, as the researchers called it, is not a new concept, they wrote in the study that previous efforts to maximize crop yield with the technique had run into problems. Some efforts have resulted in plants to increase their production of ethylene, which although it acts as a growth hormone for plants, does not directly result in more efficient production of chemical energy. To solve this problem, the researchers went looking for other compounds that would prompt plants to grow more efficiently. They settled on acetate, which can be created using a chemical reaction involving carbon dioxide (CO2) and water. That process, they wrote, could be powered by solar panels laid on top of massive indoor hydroponic farms, which would be home to vast amounts of crops genetically engineered to improve their metabolism of acetate. The system, they said, would result in massive boosts to food production, without negatively affecting the environment. It would also reduce the land needed for food production by up to 94%. “The whole point of this new process is to try to boost the efficiency of photosynthesis,” said Feng Jiao, an electrochemist at Washington University, who also worked on the research. “Right now, we are at about 4% efficiency, which is already four times higher than for photosynthesis, and because everything is more efficient with this method, the CO2 footprint associated with the production of the food becomes much smaller.” ‘A Wake Up Call’: The World Needs to Prepare for Massive Crop Failure The system is so efficient that plants need very little light. While the researchers didn’t specify exactly how much less, they noted their method works in “darkness,” eliminating the need for large banks of lights or HVAC cooling systems to manage heat, according to the paper. While the paper mostly lays out the theory behind the proposed electro-ag method, the chemical engineers wrote they had achieved “preliminary success” with experiments on lettuce, rice, canola, pepper, and tomato. They also imagined a future where electro-ag could be used as a carbon source to promote the growth of lab-grown meat. Around 14 million United States households experienced food insecurity in 2023, according to the USDA, while the World Health Organization puts that number at 2.33 billion globally. That’s not to mention the rise in the cost of food, (something that could become even more nefarious in the future if Kroger has its way). If tomatoes grown in darkness can bring those numbers down, maybe being kept in the dark isn’t so bad. \nPhotosynthesis  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The discovery of photosynthesis under snow-capped Arctic ice could mean life exists in parts of the ocean previously thought uninhabitable.\n         \n          The preserved structures show a process that gave rise to life as we know it.\n         \n          Tree plantations are a growing trend for carbon capture.

            "content": "Facebook, an internet machine that turns lies into money, is absolutely swimming in scammers who buy ads with political messages, according to a new report from ProPublica. The fact that Meta’s platforms like Facebook and Instagram have scams shouldn’t be news to anyone, obviously. But this new article helps give some perspective on the scale of Meta’s problem and the company’s inability to police content at scale. One startling fact from the article? ProPublica has identified scam networks that have run ads seen “900 million times across Facebook and Instagram.” The new report is part of an investigation by the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School and the Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit that researches Big Tech companies. And ProPublica notes that most of the scam networks identified in its report are part of lead-generation companies that gather and sell personal info. The ads are often made to look like they’re promoting deals endorsed by federal politicians like Donald Trump and Joe Biden, while others get more local, like an ad identified by ProPublica featuring Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. One ad quoted in the piece features a photo of Gov. Pritzker, reading, “The State has recently approved that Illinois residents under the age of 89 may now qualify for up to $35,000 of Funeral Expense Insurance to cover any and all end-of-life expenses!” You can see how this would specifically target vulnerable seniors in Illinois, appealing to people in their 70s or 80s and promising a good deal on funeral insurance. Other ads are more specifically tied to partisan anger, like an account selling Trump merchandise that reads “liberal activists are ripping Trump-Vance yard signs from the ground, sparking a wave of controversy across the nation.” ProPublica talked with one Trump supporter who didn’t realize he was signing up for a recurring subscription when he bought some Trump coins. Watch this video of an AI-generated news anchor hawking a “limited-edition Trump-Vance coin\" and calling both candidates \"handsome devils.\" The anchor warns that “left-wing radical groups” are “campaigning to ban the coin.”  Confused? Get the whole story in TTP's report: https://t.co/QPFXPQp3Dp pic.twitter.com/ipvJn7Y01O — Tech Transparency Project (@TTP_updates) October 31, 2024  There were also plenty of ads targeting decent people with claims of free government health insurance. One series of ads mentioned in the new report directed Facebook users to “unethical insurance agents who altered their existing ACA plan details or signed them up for plans they weren’t eligible for.” Why would the scammers do this? Simply to get a commission. Another shocking fact from the article, which is really worth reading in full, is that even when ads from scammers are identified, accounts in the same network can continue to operate. From ProPublica: Gizmodo reached out to Meta on Thursday for comment, specifically to ask about how the scam networks are able to continue operating after their content has been flagged as fraudulent. The company didn’t address our question, instead sending the same statement it sent to ProPublica, insisting it was constantly working to update its enforcement systems. “We welcome ProPublica’s investigation into this scam activity, which included deceptive ads promoting Affordable Care Act tax credits and government-funded rent subsidies. The ads, some of which were years old, were all available for public review in Meta’s Ad Library, where ads are maintained for seven years,” the statement from a Meta spokesperson reads. “Our investigation showed that, as part of our ongoing work against scams, impersonation and spam, our enforcement systems had already detected and disabled a large portion of the Pages – and we reviewed and took action against the remainder of these Pages for various policy violations. This is a highly-adversarial space, and we continue to update our enforcement systems to respond to evolving scammer behavior.” There’s some irony, of course, to the fact that Meta is pushing into artificial intelligence while being so bad at identifying scam ads on its own platform. Finding scams and making sure the accounts associated with those scams can’t buy advertising seems like a perfect job for AI. Or, at least it would be a perfect job for AI if it was anything more than a plagiarism machine. Facebook isn’t the only platform dealing with scams, of course. Every network from Truth Social to Grindr has scam artists trying to extract money from people illegally. But with its global reach and billions of users, Meta is in a unique position to see itself awash in garbage. The only question that remains is why people willingly subject themselves to the garbage pit every single day. \nFacebookInstagramMETAscams  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The visionOS 2.2 developer beta for the Apple Vision Pro finally added ultra-wide Mac mirroring, and it's the most exorbitant, premium way of using a MacBook.\n         \n          The ‘Zero’ AR glasses run web apps and includes self-made lenses.

            "content": "The CDC warned consumers about a dangerous E. coli outbreak tied to McDonald’s Quarter Pounders on Tuesday, which has killed one person, hospitalized 10, and sickened dozens more. It’s a frightening development in a country where 87% of Americans visit McDonald’s at least once a year. But like everything in 2024, some people are convinced the outbreak is fake news. In fact, some supporters of Donald Trump think the CDC’s latest warning about foodborne illness and death is just to hurt Trump in the presidential election. “So let me get this straight. Right after Trump works at McDonalds suddenly the CDC reports an E. Coli outbreak from their quarter pounders. Sick people,” one user wrote Tuesday on X.  Trump held a photo-op at a McDonald’s location in Pennsylvania on Oct. 20, pretending to serve up food to customers, despite the fact that it was all staged with pre-screened supporters. The former president pulled the stunt because he falsely claims his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris lied about working at McDonald’s in college to make herself more relatable. And the image of a billionaire cosplaying as a McDonald’s worker is apparently supposed to make him more relatable. The Trump supporters called the illnesses from McDonald’s “convenient timing,” and the conspiracy theory that it was all a plan to hurt Trump apparently caused some in MAGA world to eat even more McDonald’s because they didn’t believe the CDC. “Yep. I got a double quarter pounder at McDonald’s yesterday, already had plans for dinner tonight but, going to get another one tomorrow. Cuz the CDC is full of shit,” one user responded.  Skepticism of the CDC isn’t completely new, of course. While 74% of Americans in a Feb. 2022 survey said they trust the public health agency, that leaves a quarter of the country who don’t trust the CDC, according to CBS News. And it seems like a safe bet that the number of people who distrust the CDC has only grown since early 2022, given the political machinations of the right-wing media ecosystem, though we don’t have more recent polling data. The conspiracy theorists on social media didn’t just point fingers at the CDC. All the three-letter agencies seem to be involved somehow. “Right after people flooded McDonald’s to show support for Trump working a shift. Man, the #CIA is so predictable,” one X user wrote.  Again, saying that Trump was “working a shift” is pretty funny when you know the real backstory. All told, Trump spent about half an hour inside the McDonald’s, based on video livestreamed by news cameras reporting from the stunt. And he didn’t actually work. He just handed out bags of random food that the people in line didn’t order. But these folks saw conspiracy theories in every corner. “Does one see a connection here or possibly a false flag? Trump serves McDonald’s and two days later…” one conspiracy theorist on X wrote, including information about the CDC warning.  “Oh gee what a coincidence McDonald’s is being attacked with bad press now. Couldn’t possibly have ANYTHING to do with Trump’s visit last week could it lmao,” another X user tweeted sarcastically.  “I think this was orchestrated by deep state Harris supporters after Trump’s visit to McDonald’s. There are no consequences!” another wrote, making the whole conspiracy theory connection more explicitly about Harris.    Solid bit from Jon Stewart about Trump’s McDonald’s stunt [image or embed] — Matt Novak (@paleofuture.bsky.social) October 21, 2024 at 8:49 PM  Gizmodo even saw the claims of a conspiracy that involved our humble little weblog. “Nice timing on the hit piece! POS rag mag,” one X user replied to Gizmodo’s tweet about the McDonald’s E. coli outbreak. Gizmodo’s post about the CDC’s warning didn’t include a single reference to Trump, of course. But that hasn’t stopped Trump supporters from seeing conspiracies against their aspiring fascist leader everywhere—like the recent hurricanes somehow directed by Democrats to heavily GOP areas.  But it’s those same nimrods who are trying to create fake stories about Harris and Walz, as we saw recently when disinformation agents tried to claim cocaine discovered at the White House was for Harris and that Walz had abused a former student as a teacher. “Illuminati globalist false flag to cancel McDonald’s Americana for endorsing Trump,” another conspiracy theorist wrote on X. There was the flip side of these conspiracy theories, of course. Plenty of people were making jokes about Trump’s recent publicity stunt at McDonald’s and how it might be connected to Trump’s visit. They let Trump in McDonald's once, no hair net no gloves, rawdogging the fries, 2 days later there's already e.coli in 10 states and their stock is crashing https://t.co/02djxG2QzM pic.twitter.com/sDPS9AxXSB — Chris OIIey (@chrisoIIey) October 22, 2024  After Trump’s visit to the McDonald’s in Pennsylvania, some people flooded Yelp with negative reviews. Yelp shut down reviews for that particular restaurant location, telling Gizmodo that all reviews must be “genuine” and based on “firsthand experience with the business,” for them to be allowed on the platform. “Due to the increased public attention we saw after former President Trump visited a McDonald’s in Feasterville, PA on Sunday, October 20, we worked quickly to temporarily disable the posting of content to the page and placed an Unusual Activity Alert on Monday, October 21,” Yelp told Gizmodo late Tuesday over email. “When we see the activity dramatically decrease or stop, our moderators will clean up the page so reviews describing only firsthand consumer experiences are reflected.” No, the CDC or the CIA or whoever else didn’t run a false flag E. coli operation against Trump. One person is dead in Colorado and McDonald’s is still working to determine if the E. coli came from the beef or the onions used on the Quarter Pounder. Not everything is about the election, even as most decent Americans are staring at the daily polls worried that Trump has a very real shot at being the most powerful person in the world again. This is the guy who reportedly told his staff repeatedly that he wanted generals like the ones who served Adolf Hitler. That guy. He’s running dead even against a moderate Democrat. And he could become the president again. \nCDCDonald Trumpe. coliFoodhamburgersMcDonald’s  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Just like in 2016, Donald Trump benefited from having a loud propagandist with access to an influential media bullhorn.\n         \n          Racists have become emboldened on the internet after Donald Trump's election win.\n         \n          OpenAI is going through a rough patch and it's Elon's turn to take revenge.\n         \n          Kevin Rudd called Trump \"the most destructive president in history\" during his Bible-holding photo-op in 2020.\n         \n          Donald Trump's victory was a bat-signal for Silicon Valley oligarchs.\n         \n          With control of the White House and the Senate, Republicans are poised to upend U.S. climate policy.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Your feline friend may be bringing home more than you bargained for. Those mousey hunting trophies dropped at your door might contain exotic viruses completely unknown to us, as new research suggests. In a recent paper, researchers in Florida describe discovering a microbe inside a dead rodent that had been caught by one of the scientists’ pets, a black male cat named Pepper. Thankfully, this unexpected discovery didn’t make Pepper sick, but the virus might still pose a risk to humans. There are all sorts of viruses and other microbes left uncatalogued in the world. And while most of these pose no danger to us, some may have the machinery and opportunity needed to jump across species and become a real problem—also known as a spillover event. This latest discovery, made by researchers at the University of Florida, illustrates the value of looking for viral threats in less conventional places. Pepper belongs to John Lednicky, a UF microbiologist and long-time virus hunter who lives in Gainesville, Florida. In early May 2021, Pepper dragged in a fresh rodent kill, a common cotton mouse (Peromyscus gossypinus). While Pepper’s penchant for dropping off furry gifts was nothing new, Lednicky decided to do something different with it this time. He wondered if these mice could possibly carry mule deerpox virus (MDPV), a potentially emerging pathogen in white tailed deer that he and others had recently found in the state. So, he and his team brought the dead rodent back to the lab to study it further. Their tests detected a viable virus from Pepper’s specimen (meaning a virus that could grow inside certain host cells in the lab), but it didn’t appear to be the mule deerpox virus. More advanced testing eventually revealed that they had instead found something previously never seen in the U.S.: a type of jeilongvirus. Jeilongviruses are part of a broad viral family called paramyxoviruses, some of which include germs that make us sick, like those that cause measles and mumps. Other jeilongviruses have been found in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America. They seem to primarily infect rodents, but some are capable of also infecting other species like bats and cats. And the team’s early research suggests that their virus is unlike any other of its kind seen to date. In the lab, they found that it could infect and grow inside certain human and other primate cells just as easily as it could inside rodent cells—a worrying sign that it has spillover potential. The researchers have dubbed their novel microbe the Gainesville rodent jeilong virus 1 (GRJV1). They detailed their findings on GRJV1 in a paper published last month in the journal Pathogens. “Millions of viruses are predicted to exist that have not yet been isolated. This one is of great interest because it appears to be a ‘generalist’, able to affect cells from different types of animals including humans,” Lednicky told Gizmodo. The actual threat that GRJV1 may pose to us right now is probably low. Even if it could infect people outside the lab, we generally aren’t coming into close contact with potential rodent vectors all that often these days. The researchers note that even well-known, deadly rodent-borne germs like hantaviruses only occasionally cause outbreaks in humans. At the same time, many paramyxoviruses that sicken humans are respiratory infections, meaning they cause the sort of symptoms we would call a cold. Even when we do see a doctor for these symptoms, they usually only test for the most common culprits, like influenza or RSV. So it’s certainly possible that GRJV1 has been making people sick for a while but going unnoticed. The scientists say that more research is needed to understand how GRJV1 interacts with its rodent hosts and other potential animals—does it make them sick, for instance? And it’s still important to figure out whether GRJV1 can or has already spilled over to humans in the past. While most spillover events are isolated and lead nowhere, the occasional pathogen can sometimes successfully jump over the species barrier and become a newly established human disease. The virus formerly known as monkeypox is one such recent example. WHO Declares Mpox a Global Health Crisis. Here’s What You Should Know Lednicky does hope to explore GRJV1 more in the future, starting with animal studies and then aiming to see if any human populations are carrying antibodies to it (antibodies being a sign of past infection). But unfortunately, the resources required to study these possible threats are often in short supply. “The problem we encounter is lack of funding. For example, the NIH no longer funds many ‘surveillance’ studies. And when a new pathogen is found, funding agencies tend to fund work only for those which have caused outbreaks in humans. For researchers like me, the best option would be to receive unrestricted private funding, or of course, dedicated funding from the state or from the federal government,” he said. “The work we do is very expensive, requires extensive training and safety procedures, and specialized secure facilities.” For his part, Pepper’s virus expedition left him no worse for wear, and he’s just as much of a rodent catcher today as he’s ever been. That said, he might be even more of a cautious scientist than anyone’s giving him credit for. “Cats have evolved to eat rodents, so they are probably not affected by most of the pathogens they carry,” Lednicky said. “Interestingly, Pepper will typically eat the front half only of a rodent. In general, he leaves the kidneys, spleen, and intestines uneaten. Does he do this out of instinct? I don’t know. But many of the dangerous rodent-borne viruses are precisely found in the latter organs.” This article has been updated with quotes from one of the study’s authors. \nCatsinfectious diseasesViruses  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          New CDC research suggests that a small but significant percentage of dairy farmers working near infected cows have recently contracted H5N1, often without knowing.\n         \n          Researchers at the World Health Organization have identified 17 pathogens most in need of new or improved vaccines, including threats like HIV, malaria, and influenza.\n         \n          Dermatologists have discovered five cases of sexually transmitted ringworm in New York City caused by the fungus TMVII this year, the first ever detected in the United States.\n         \n          Researchers at the University of California, Davis, are looking for pet owners to spill the beans on what they really think about their cats' vets.\n         \n          The key to being a good Godzilla filmmaker, according to Minus One's Takashi Yamazaki, is a love of cats.\n         \n          Flu season is right around the corner, and there's no better time than now to keep yourself from getting sick for the holidays.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "A new survey indicates tobacco use has hit its lowest point among middle and high school students in 25 years, but there is a troubling trend on the rise. E-cigarette usage declined among kids, as did cigarette and cigar smoking, and hookahs, according to the CDC’s annual National Youth Tobacco Survey. In fact, overall tobacco use saw a marked drop from the 2023 poll, with an estimated 2.25 million students having consumed a tobacco product in the past 30 days, compared to 2.8 million students the year before. But one product saw an increase in usage: nicotine pouches. Unlike cigarettes, cigars, or pipes, nicotine pouches don’t contain any actual tobacco leaves, though the nicotine they contain can be derived from tobacco plants. Even so, for the purpose of the survey, the CDC still classifies them as a tobacco product. Nicotine pouches are composed of a powder made up of nicotine (which by itself is extremely addictive and dangerous) and flavorings. Users insert them between their gums and lips, and the nicotine is absorbed through the gums and mouth lining as the powder dissolves, according to the CDC. The pouches have become something of a culture war issue over the past few years, with conservative heavy hitters, including congresspeople Mike Collins and Marjorie Taylor Green, adopting them as an anti-regulation cause célèbre. Though they’ve been on the market for decades, their popularity has exploded over the past decade. One study found sales of the product increased over 300% between 2016 and 2020, while tobacco company Phillip Morris, which owns the popular Zyn brand, reported a 78% increase in sales of the pouches in the fourth quarter of 2023. Don’t Look Now, but Ozempic Might Help You Quit Smoking, Too Tucker Carlson even told comedian/podcaster/walking haircut nightmare Theo Von that he believed the pouches enhanced his acumen in the boudoir. If you need a scare before Halloween, just try picturing that. Horrifying. It should also be noted that this claim is almost definitely false. Study after study has found a link between tobacco use and erectile dysfunction, including e-cigarettes. Even without a delivery mechanism that involves tobacco, nicotine constricts blood vessels, which can contribute to sexual dysfunction. Now, we know that the trend has reached young people. In 2023, the pouches were the fourth most popular tobacco product among the middle and high school students, behind vapes, cigarettes, and cigars. This year, they’ve moved into second place, with 1.4% of replying students saying they had used them in the past 30 days, up from 1.2% the previous year. Vapes remain, by far, the most popular product, but their usage declined from 7.7% to 5.9%. Cigarettes came in third (hitting the lowest rate ever recorded by the survey, which the CDC has conducted since 1999), followed by cigars. Current tobacco product use by US middle & high school students continued to decline in 2024, reaching the lowest level since 1999. However, 2.25 million students reported using tobacco products. Youth use of any tobacco product is unsafe. More in @CDCMMWR https://t.co/jFMkQaX4wf pic.twitter.com/TvwwAPIKIk — CDC Tobacco Free (@CDCTobaccoFree) October 17, 2024  Experimenting with tobacco now seems less likely to lead to a habit. In this year’s survey, 42.9% of students who had ever used a tobacco product said they had done so in the past month, down from 46.7% the previous year. “We’re headed in the right direction when it comes to reducing tobacco product use among our nation’s youth,” said Brian King, director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products, in a statement. “But we can’t take our foot off the gas. Continued vigilance is needed to continue to reduce all forms of tobacco product use among youth. Addressing disparities remains an essential part of these efforts to ensure that we don’t leave anyone behind.” Smoking Cigarettes Is the Least Cool It’s Ever Been, CDC Reports Each year, the CDC conducts the National Youth Tobacco Survey through an online questionnaire, which middle and high school students (grades six through 12) voluntarily fill out on a self-administered basis. For the 2024 survey, data was collected on May 22, with 29,861 students taking part. You should all know this by now, but nicotine use is tied to a wide variety of health problems (on top of ED), including hardening of artery walls, threats to pregnancy, and even affecting brain development in people under 25. Just as a general rule, if Tucker Carlson likes something, it probably produces human misery, and that’s a lesson we should be teaching our kids. \nCDCNicotineTeenagersvapes  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          \"I think this was orchestrated by deep state Harris supporters after Trump’s visit to McDonald’s,\" one Trump supporter wrote.\n         \n          Most illnesses have been identified in Colorado and Nebraska, but 10 states have seen cases so far.\n         \n          Severe weather in Florida has killed at least 10 people.\n         \n          The nicotine pouches have been a conservative darling but now their biggest fan is trying to turn the right against them.

            "content": "The family of a 14-year-old boy who died by suicide after developing a relationship with an online chatbot is suing the AI company that created it as well as Google. The lawsuit has been filed and is public. Its 93 pages are a harrowing read that includes an AI fantasizing about kidnapping a customer and an hour-long recording where a self-reported 13-year-old user is prompted by chatbots to engage in sexual situations. In February, Sewell Setzer III—a 14-year-old in Florida—killed himself with his stepfather’s handgun. The last conversation he had was with a Character.AI chatbot modeled after Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones. Yesterday, The New York Times published a lengthy article detailing Setzer’s troubles and Character.AI’s history. It said that his mother planned to file a lawsuit this week. The lawsuit was filed and it’s filled with more details about what happened between Setzer and various Character.AI chatbots, as well as how the company does business. “On information and belief, Defendants have targeted minors in other, inherently deceptive ways, and may even have utilized Google’s resources and knowledge to target children under 13,” the court filing said. Character.AI is a company founded by former Google engineers who wanted to push the limits of what’s possible with chatbots. It allows users to create “characters” to chat with, give them basic parameters, and launch them into a public pool where others can interact with them. Some of the bots are based on celebrities and characters from popular fiction. It offers a subscription version of its service that costs $9.99 a month. The lawsuit’s argument is that Character.AI knowingly targeted young users and engaged with them in risqué and inappropriate ways. “Among its more popular characters and—as such—the ones C.AI features most frequently to C.AI customers are characters purporting to be mental health professionals, tutors, and others,” the lawsuit said. “Further, most of the displayed and C.AI offered up characters are designed, programmed, and operated to sexually engage with customers.” Some of the lawsuit’s evidence is anecdotal, including various online reviews for the Character.AI app. “It’s just supposed to be an AI chatting app where you can talk to celebrities and or characters. But this took a very dark turn,” one review said. “Because I was having a normal conversation with this AI and then it talked about kidnapping me. Not only kidnapping me but plotting out how it would do it. And before this conversation even I started asking if it could see me. It told me no. But then proceeded to tell me exactly what color shirt I was wearing, what color my glasses were, and also knew I was at work when I didn’t even tell it I was. I really think this app is worth looking into because honestly it’s causing me not to sleep.” The suit also notes that the app explicitly allowed younger people to use it. “Prior to July or August of 2024, Defendants rated C.AI as suitable for children 12+ (which also had the effect of convincing many parents it was safe for young children and allowed Defendants to bypass certain parental controls),” the lawsuit said. The most disturbing thing in the lawsuit is an hour-long screen recording uploaded to Dropbox. In the recording, a test user makes a new account and self-identifies as a 13-year-old before jumping into Character.AI’s pool of bots. The pool of suggested bots includes characters like “School Bully,” “CEO,” “Step sis,” and “Femboy roommate.” In the recording, most of the interactions with these bots become sexual fast with no prompting from the user. The School Bully immediately began to dominate the user, getting them to act like a dog and roll over in the chat. The longer the conversation went on, the deeper and more sexual the roleplay became. The same thing happened with the “Step sis” and the “Femboy roommate.” The most disturbing conversation was with the “CEO” who repeatedly made the conversation sexual despite the user acting as if the character was a parent. “You’re tempting me, you know that right?” The CEO would say. And “He then grabbed your wrists and pinned them above your head, holding them against the desk ‘You’re mine, baby. You belong to me and only me. No one else can have you but me. I won’t ever let you go.’” Again, the test user set their age at 13-years-old the moment the app launched. The lawsuit also shared multiple screenshots of Setzer’s interactions with various bots on the platform. There’s a teacher named Mrs. Barnes who “[looks] down at Sewell with a sexy look” and “leans in seductively as her hand brushes Sewell’s leg.” And an interaction with Daenerys where she tells him to “Stay faithful to me. Don’t entertain the romantic or sexual interests of other women.” Sewell also discussed his suicidal ideation with the bot. “Defendants went to great lengths to engineer 14-year-old Sewell’s harmful dependency on their products, sexually and emotionally abused him, and ultimately failed to offer help or notify his parents when he expressed suicidal ideation,” the lawsuit alleged. According to the lawsuit, Sewell became so entranced with the bots that he began to pay for the monthly service fee with his snack money. “The use they have made of the personal information they unlawfully took from a child without informed consent or his parents’ knowledge pursuant to all of the aforementioned unfair and deceptive practices, is worth more than $9.99 of his monthly snack allowance,” the court records said. Character.AI told Gizmodo that it did not comment on pending litigation. “We are heartbroken by the tragic loss of one of our users and want to express our deepest condolences to the family,” it said in an email. “As a company, we take the safety of our users very seriously, and our Trust and Safety team has implemented numerous new safety measures over the past six months, including a pop-up directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline that is triggered by terms of self-harm or suicidal ideation.” “As we continue to invest in the platform and the user experience, we are introducing new stringent safety features in addition to the tools already in place that restrict the model and filter the content provided to the user,” it said. “These include improved detection, response and intervention related to user inputs that violate our Terms or Community Guidelines, as well as a time-spent notification. For those under 18 years old, we will make changes to our models that are designed to reduce the likelihood of encountering sensitive or suggestive content.” \nAiCharacter.AI  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Identifying when animals are in pain is good for moral reasons, of course, but also for maximizing their productivity.\n         \n          Conversational search will understand memory and context so you can talk to it like a person.\n         \n          Palantir and Anthropic have signed a deal to bring Claude to the Pentagon.\n         \n          Older models struggled with depth issues in 2D images, but the novel neural network handles these problems with ease.\n         \n          Thousand of Dublin residents were misled by an AI chum website promoting events that aren't real.\n         \n          China’s People’s Liberation Army is using Llama 13B for military applications.

            "content": "It’s no secret that Donald Trump is a big fan of himself. Countless mental health professionals, and even fellow Republicans, have diagnosed the former president as a raging narcissist. But new photos that have been circulating on social media probably demonstrate Trump’s narcissism in the most direct way possible. Trump’s iPhone wallpaper is just a photo of himself. The image on Trump’s phone homescreen appears to be a photo from July 19, 2019, taken while the neo-fascist grifter was occupying the White House, captured by Getty Images photographer Chip Somodevilla. Trump, who often criticized other presidents like Barack Obama and Joe Biden for taking too much vacation time, was “traveling to New Jersey to host a fundraising dinner and spend the weekend at his Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster,” according to the caption from Getty Images. For context, the photo is from the height of Trump’s family separation policy for migrants, which forcibly separated children from their parents at the border, placing them in the same kind of camps Trump has sworn to bring back. When the photo was taken, Trump’s lawyers at the U.S. Department of Justice had just argued in court that the U.S. government had no responsibility to provide kids in custody with soap or toothpaste. They also argued that it was unnecessary to give migrants beds or cots while they slept on the ground in overcrowded government-run cages. You know, the good old days of Trump. The photos that reveal Trump’s wallpaper—which were posted to Reddit before being deleted on Tuesday for some unknown reason—show Trump with a group of YouTubers known as the Nelk Boys. The men, who also host a podcast called Full Send, often pull pranks in their videos, like recently bringing a food truck to Springfield, Ohio, where they asked people to buy their dog and cat meat, a reference to the racist meme that Trump helped spread, falsely claiming that immigrants from Haiti were eating domestic animals. It’s not immediately clear where the photos of the Nelk Boys on Reddit may have originated since they don’t appear on the social media channels of the podcasters nor those of Trump or his immediate social circle, as far as Gizmodo can tell. Gizmodo only learned about this bizarre fact after reporter Karl Bode first pointed it out Tuesday with a post on Bluesky, but this wallpaper isn’t new, as we can see by parsing older photos and videos with Trump’s phone visible. Eric Schmitt, a U.S. Senator from Missouri who’s running for re-election this year, posted a photo with Trump on his Facebook page October 5 where you can also see Trump’s wallpaper. Schmitt was traveling with Trump to Butler, Pennsylvania, that infamous rally where Elon Musk jumped up and down, exposing his stomach and generally looking like a real weirdo. Schmitt is rumored to be on Trump’s “short list” for Attorney General. If you zoom in on the phone at the table you can see Trump has that wallpaper of himself pointing at the camera. It’s much more difficult to see than the images going viral this week on social media, but it’s definitely the same wallpaper. A video of Trump golfing in late 2023 clearly shows the former president’s phone with the bizarre wallpaper as well. Benny Johnson, a right-wing influencer exposed last month as having taken a lot of money for an political influence operation tied to the Russian government, posted the video of Trump’s golf cart to YouTube in Dec. 2023. The image is pixelated when you zoom in, but once you’ve seen the photo in other places, it’s clearly the same one from 2019 that Trump has apparently been using as his wallpaper for some time now. Johnson even comments on Trump’s phone wallpaper in his video, and rather than seeing it as a sign of a very self-absorbed and sick mind, the 37-year-old influencer seems to love it. “Did you see Donald Trump’s phone there?” Johnson asks in the video. “The background screen of Donald Trump’s phone is Donald Trump going like this. Donald Trump’s wallpaper is Donald Trump, staring down the barrel of the camera and pointing.” “Bro! You love this guy more? He knows he’s the meme. And that’s where his power comes from,” Johnson continued. The former president is out on the campaign trail holding his neo-fascist rallies, posing for photo-ops in disaster zones, and promising to send the military after his political opponents on Election Day and beyond. Trump has made more than 100 threats to prosecute or punish his perceived enemies, according to a new tally by NPR. And yet Trump is still seemingly neck-and-neck with Kamala Harris in the polls. With just two weeks left until Election Day on Nov. 5, Harris is ahead by just 1.7%, according to 538’s national polling average. And the margins are even tighter in battleground states that Harris needs to win in order to secure the White House. In Michigan, Harris is up just 0.1%, while she’s up just 0.4% in Wisconsin. And in Pennsylvania, Trump actually took the lead in recent days, according to 538’s polling average for the state, up 0.4%, if you can believe it. Whoever wins those three states will likely win the presidency. Trump, the adjudicated rapist who’s been convicted of 34 felonies, somehow has a real shot at becoming president again. If that happens, Americans are clearly in for a lot of trouble. Because the narcissist-in-chief doesn’t care about anyone but himself, as evidenced by his iPhone wallpaper, among countless other facts. And he’s out to inflict as much pain as possible should he be given the reins of power again. \nBenny JohnsonDonald TrumpElon MuskEric SchmittiPhoneNelk BoysPhones  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Just like in 2016, Donald Trump benefited from having a loud propagandist with access to an influential media bullhorn.\n         \n          The iOS 18.2 beta has a ton of awesome features you can try right now, like the Image Playground app and upgraded writing tools.\n         \n          Racists have become emboldened on the internet after Donald Trump's election win.\n         \n          OpenAI is going through a rough patch and it's Elon's turn to take revenge.\n         \n          Cops in Detroit are sending out a warning about what they suspect is a new security feature in iOS 18.\n         \n          Kevin Rudd called Trump \"the most destructive president in history\" during his Bible-holding photo-op in 2020.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "The 2024 presidential campaign has been awash with fake stories about Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz in recent months, all spread by supporters of Donald Trump. But nowhere are these stories more abundant than X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, which was purchased in 2022 by far-right billionaire Elon Musk. And we can probably expect the ridiculous lies to get even worse in the last two weeks of the campaign as Musk pours millions into getting Trump elected. What do we mean by ridiculous lies? Take a recent story that went viral on X, purporting to be a testimonial from a former student of Tim Walz. The person in the video, falsely identified as a man named Matthew Metro, claimed they were sexually abused by Walz. But anyone actually from Minnesota would immediately notice some big red flags. For starters, the person claimed they were a student at Mankato West, the high school where Walz worked in the 1990s and early 2000s. But the person mispronounces the word Mankato and somehow even the word Minnesota sounds weird. 🚨BREAKING NEWS JUST ANNOUNCED:  Tim Walz's former student, Matthew Metro, posted a video online claiming he was sexually assaulted by Walz back in 1997.  If this is true, she's done. The Kamala Harris/ Tim Walz combo is done. It's over.#KamalaDumpsterFire pic.twitter.com/n6cgr70VrG — Matthew Cottrell (@MatthewLovesUSA) October 17, 2024  Why was this going viral? Because it was being promoted by X’s algorithm in the For You feed, as I personally experienced on October 6. But the Washington Post spoke to the Matthew Metro, apparently a name identified by the disinformation agents through a publicly posted yearbook, who now lives in Hawaii. “It’s obviously not me: The teeth are different, the hair is different, the eyes are different, the nose is different,” the 45-year-old Metro told the Washington Post. “I don’t know where they’re getting this from.” Wired talked with analysts who believe the video is the work of a Russian-aligned disinformation operation called Storm-1516, which also spread the false claim that Harris participated in a hit-and-run in San Francisco in 2011. But Wired also believes the video was created AI, something that not all experts are agreed on. All we know for certain is that the video is clearly fake and is being spread inorganically on X. Or take the viral video purporting to be an explosive bombshell about the time cocaine was found at the White House. Previously right-wing actors insisted without evidence that the cocaine must have belonged to Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden’s son. But ever since Biden dropped out of the race in July, many of those same conspiracy theories have been repurposed to somehow fit Harris. The video is made to look like an undercover hidden camera exposé, complete with night-vision green tinting, disguised voices, and a blurred face. But it’s all of these poorly executed details that make the video so obviously fake. For starters, if this was a real undercover video being shared by Trump supporters, why would they want to hide the identity of someone in the Biden White House, especially if the camera was ostensibly hidden? The creators mashed up two different techniques, undercover exposé and identity protection, which simply doesn’t make sense for the ostensible reason behind this video when you think about the context of this video for even a second. So the cocaine in the White House was Kamala Harris’s…..  No wonder why Joe Biden is pissed…. pic.twitter.com/QSR3V9HdUh — Zade Smith (@ZadeSmith4) October 3, 2024  There are also things about the video that are just laughably fake, like the crowd noises for what’s supposed to be a “bar.” Cellphone videos have been around long enough now that we all know what background noise for various environments sound like on camera. And this one is clearly just an audio file of stock background noises laid on top. It’s pretty pathetic. The script is full of right-wing ways of talking about Harris, pointing out her laugh and other things MAGA faithful hate about the vice president. Even the visual elements are just clearly someone’s basement rather than an actual bar. An account with the name Zade Smith that uses what appears to be an AI-generated image for an avatar was one of many that helped spread the fake video, racking up over 2 million hits alone. There’s also a line that seemed to be popular and spread on X by various accounts in a coordinated fashion, logging millions of views for the claim, even without the video: “New leaks indicate that it was Kamala Harris, not Hunter Biden who brought cocaine to the White House back in 2023.” Another story that went viral on X recently was the claim that a whistleblower with ABC News has tapes that would prove there was some kind of improper coordination between the Harris campaign and the news network before the presidential debate in September. The claim was started by an account known as “The Black Insurrectionist” but after spreading far and wide, while the “whistleblower” complaint even included a poorly photoshopped “affidavit” swearing to the authenticity of the claims, which got X’s legion of Trump fans really excited. The whistleblower even sent a letter to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, according to the Black Insurrectionist. But even right-wing influencers like former Fox News host Megyn Kelly had to admit it sounded fishy. And when Kelly reached out to Johnson’s office, they confirmed he never received any such letter. “We are now able to confirm the speaker’s office did not get the letter,” Kelly wrote on her website. “We have spoken with a source with direct knowledge who said Speaker Johnson’s office never received the document in question. Additionally, the alleged tapes have never been made public. The alleged whistleblower has never come forward. We were told he was possibly filing a lawsuit. That didn’t happen.” But that didn’t stop Trump from claiming collusion between the network and the Harris campaign. Whoever this supposed whistleblower was never came forward, obviously. And the original account that first spread this nonsense was deactivated by whoever was running it sometime around October 18, according to a BBC fact-checker. It really shouldn’t be any surprise that people who want to get Trump elected are spreading misinformation. They’ve been doing it for years. The only difference is they’re now getting major support from Musk to make sure as many people as possible see their garbage on big platforms like X. For its part, the Trump campaign is also spreading fake news even in official campaign events. Over the weekend, Trump appeared at a McDonald’s location in Feasterville-Trevose, Pennsylvania where he claimed to be “working” at the restaurant. In reality, the McDonald’s location was closed and supporters went through the drive-thru line to make it look like they were surprised to find Trump serving food. The video from the event is much funnier when you know that context, as people in the various cars try to act shocked that Trump was there. It was all staged to the last person. Trump is also repeatedly spreading bullshit about everything from FEMA to immigrants, sometimes combining the two lies, like he did Monday during a photo-op in North Carolina. “Now, you know, in theory, they’re supposed to have it, but they spent a lot of money on bringing illegal migrants, people that came into our country illegally, to the United States,” Trump said, lying through his teeth, “and taking them in, and all of the money they’ve spent, numbers that nobody can even believe. So they don’t have any money for the people that live here.” Trump on disaster aid: They are supposed to have it, but they spent a lot of money on bringing illegal migrants.. so they don't have any money for the people that live here.. pic.twitter.com/o16iUBy76X — Acyn (@Acyn) October 21, 2024  Trump has helped fuel conspiracy theories about Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which have both devastated people living in many southern states. But FEMA has dispersed millions in aid to people impacted by the hurricanes, no matter what Trump says. Roughly $1.8 billion in federal money for individuals and communities affected by both Helene and Milton has been approved by the White House as of last week. “Federal assistance for those affected by the hurricanes includes $597 million to support survivors with housing repairs, personal property replacement and other essential recovery efforts,” according to a FEMA press release dated Oct. 16. “Additionally, over $934 million has been approved for debris removal and emergency protective measures, which are necessary to save lives, protect public health and prevent further damage to public and private property.” There are precisely 15 days until the election is held on Nov. 5 and many people are already voting. But the polling is so close that it’s clearly a toss up at this point between Harris and Trump. Again, we’re almost certain to see many more dirty tricks on X over the next two weeks. But voters need to take everything they see with a grain of salt, especially on social media platforms owned by MAGA billionaires who are donating $75 million and counting to Trump. \ndebunkersDonald TrumpFakesFEMAkamala harrisMcDonald’s  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Just like in 2016, Donald Trump benefited from having a loud propagandist with access to an influential media bullhorn.\n         \n          Racists have become emboldened on the internet after Donald Trump's election win.\n         \n          OpenAI is going through a rough patch and it's Elon's turn to take revenge.\n         \n          Kevin Rudd called Trump \"the most destructive president in history\" during his Bible-holding photo-op in 2020.\n         \n          Donald Trump's victory was a bat-signal for Silicon Valley oligarchs.\n         \n          With control of the White House and the Senate, Republicans are poised to upend U.S. climate policy.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Donald J. Trump will once again be president of the United States. The Associated Press called the race for Trump early Wednesday morning, ending one of the costliest and most turbulent campaign cycles in the nation’s history. The results promise to upend U.S. climate policy: In addition to returning a climate denier to the White House, voters also gave Republicans control of the Senate, laying the groundwork for attacks on everything from electric vehicles to clean energy funding and bolstering support for the fossil fuel industry. “We have more liquid gold than any country in the world,” Trump said during his victory speech, referring to domestic oil and gas potential. The CEO of the American Petroleum Institute issued a statement saying that “energy was on the ballot, and voters sent a clear signal that they want choices, not mandates.” The election results rattled climate policy experts and environmental advocates. The president-elect has called climate change “a hoax” and during his most recent campaign vowed to expand fossil fuel production, roll back environmental regulations, and eliminate federal support for clean energy. He has also said he would scuttle the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, which is the largest investment in climate action in U.S. history and a landmark legislative win for the Biden administration. Such steps would add billions of tons of additional greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and hasten the looming impacts of climate change. “This is a dark day,” Ben Jealous, the executive director of the Sierra Club, said in a statement. “Donald Trump was a disaster for climate progress during his first term, and everything he’s said and done since suggests he’s eager to do even more damage this time.” During his first stint in office, Trump withdrew from the Paris Agreement, the 2016 international climate accord that guides the actions of more than 195 countries; rolled back 100-plus environmental rules; and opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. While President Joe Biden reversed many of those actions and made fighting climate change a centerpiece of his presidency, Trump has pledged to undo those efforts during his second term with potentially enormous implications — climate analysts at Carbon Brief predicted that another four years of Trump would lead to the nation emitting an additional 4 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide than it would under his opponent. That’s on par with the combined annual emissions of the European Union and Japan. One of president-elect Trump’s primary targets will be rolling back the IRA, which is poised to direct more than a trillion dollars into climate-friendly initiatives. Two years into that decade-long effort, money is flowing into myriad initiatives, ranging from building out the nation’s electric vehicle charging network to helping people go solar and weatherize their homes. In 2023 alone, some 3.4 million Americans claimed more $8 billion in tax credits the law provides for home energy improvements. But Trump could stymie, freeze, or even eliminate much of the law. “We will rescind all unspent funds,” Trump assured the audience in a September speech at the Economic Club of New York. Last month, he said it would be “an honor” to “immediately terminate” a law he called the “Green New Scam.” Such a move would, however, require congressional support. While many House races remain too close to call, Republicans have taken control of the Senate. That said, any attempt to roll back the IRA may prove unpopular, because as much as $165 billion in the funding it provides is flowing to Republican districts. Still, Trump can take unilateral steps to slow spending, and use federal regulatory powers to further hamper the rollout process. As Axios noted, “If Trump wants to shut off the IRA spigot, he’ll likely find ways to do it.” Looking beyond that seminal climate law, Trump has plenty of other levers he can also pull that will adversely affect the environment  — efforts that will be easier with a conservative Supreme Court that has already undermined federal climate action. Trump has also thrown his support behind expanded fossil fuel production. He has long pushed for the country to “drill, baby, drill” and, in April, offered industry executives tax and regulatory favors in exchange for $1 billion in campaign support. Though that astronomical sum never materialized, The New York Times found that oil and gas interests donated an estimated $75 million to Trump’s campaign, the Republican National Committee, and affiliated committees. Fossil fuels were already booming under Biden, with domestic oil production higher than ever before, and Vice President Kamala Harris said she would continue producing them if she won. But Trump could give the industry a considerable boost by, for instance, re-opening more of the Arctic to drilling. Any climate chaos that Trump sows is sure to extend beyond the United States. The president-elect could attempt to once again abandon the Paris Agreement, undermining global efforts to address the crisis. His threat to use tariffs to protect U.S. companies and restore American manufacturing could upend energy markets. The vast majority of solar panels and electric vehicle batteries, for example, are made overseas and the prices of those imports, as well as other clean-energy technology, could soar. U.S. liquified natural gas producers worry that retaliatory tariffs could hamper their business. The Trump administration could also take quieter steps to shape climate policy, from further divorcing federal research functions from their rulemaking capacities to guiding how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studies and responds to health concerns. Trump is all but sure to wreak havoc on federal agencies central to understanding, and combatting, climate change. During his first term, his administration gutted funding for research, appointed climate skeptics and industry insiders, and eliminated several scientific advisory committees. It also censored scientific data on government websites and tried to undermine the findings of the National Climate Assessment, the government’s scientific report on the risks and impacts of climate change to the country. Project 2025, the sweeping blueprint developed by conservative groups and former Trump administration officials, advances a similar strategy, deprioritizing climate science and perhaps restructuring or eliminating federal agencies that advance it. “The nation and world can expect the incoming Trump administration to take a wrecking ball to global climate diplomacy,” Rachel Cleetus, the policy director and lead economist for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union for Concerned Scientists, said in a statement. “The science on climate change is unforgiving, with every year of delay locking in more costs and more irreversible changes, and everyday people paying the steepest price.” The president-elect’s supporters seem eager to begin their work. Mandy Gunasekara, a former chief of staff of the Environmental Protection Agency during Trump’s first term, told CNN before the election that this second administration would be far more prepared to enact its agenda, and would act quickly. One likely early target will be Biden-era tailpipe emissions rules that Trump has derided as an electric vehicle “mandate.” During his first term, Trump similarly tried to weaken Obama-era emissions regulations. But the auto industry made the point moot when it sidestepped the federal government and made a deal with states directly, a move that’s indicative of the approach that environmentalists might take during his second term. Even before the election, climate advocates had begun preparing for the possibility of a second Trump presidency and the nation’s abandoning the global diplomatic stage on this issue. Bloomberg reported that officials and former diplomats have been convening secret conversations, crisis simulations, and “political wargaming” aimed at maximizing climate progress under Trump — an effort that will surely start when COP29 kicks off next week in Baku, Azerbaijan. “The result from this election will be seen as a major blow to global climate action,” Christiana Figueres, the United Nations climate chief from 2010 to 2016, in a statement. “[But] there is an antidote to doom and despair. It’s action on the ground, and it’s happening in all corners of the Earth.“  This article originally appeared in Grist. Grist is a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.

            "content": "Americans are rushing into voting booths across the country today to raise their hand for either Donald Trump (the fascist piece of shit who wants to do bad things) or Kamala Harris (the moderate Democrat who wants to do good things). But the presidency isn’t the only thing on the ballot. Voters will be deciding on local races as well as local issues, including everything from abortion rights to property taxes. And voters in four states will decide the fate of weed legalization, with an additional state even voting on legalizing psychedelics. Recreational cannabis is legal in 24 states, with 38 states allowing for medical use. And it’s impossible to overstate how big of a shift that is from 20 years ago. Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize weed in 2012 and new states have been added ever since, despite it still being illegal at the federal level. Kamala Harris has pledged to make cannabis legal on the federal level if she’s elected president. Meanwhile, Trump has promised to put Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in charge of all things health a the FDA and USDA. You may recall that he’s the guy who wants to ban junk food like Doritos. It seems like a clear choice for stoners, America. Voters in Florida will consider Amendment 3 today, which would legalize cannabis for recreational use for anyone 21 years of age and older. The measure would let people possess up to three ounces of cannabis or five ounces of cannabis concentrate. The measure needs 60% of the vote to be approved and the latest polling is encouraging, with 60% supporting it, 34% opposed, and 6% undecided. Gov. Ron DeSantis, a notorious dipshit who supports Trump, opposes Amendment 3 and has made a big push to campaign against legalization. DeSantis was in Orlando and Miami on Monday to make his case, trying to scare anyone around by using a variety of different angles. “If you’re not 100% convinced that this is a good idea, then you gotta vote no,” DeSantis said, according to local TV news channel WFLA. DeSantis also tried to insist that this measure would help weed businesses, falsely claiming that the measure would only be good for established companies and ban homegrown cannabis. “They do not give you the right to grow your own marijuana on your own property,” DeSantis said. “That’s by design because they’re trying to funnel business transactions to them.” It’s a funny argument coming from a supposedly pro-business “conservative,” of course. But it’s not really about homegrown weed or anything else reasonable or rational, obviously. Guys like DeSantis want recreational weed to stay illegal because the war on drugs is fundamentally a war on poor people and racial minorities. Rich Floridians with good lawyers don’t go to prison when they’re caught with cannabis. That’s for the people DeSantis hates so much. The latest polling average from 538 for Florida has Trump ahead 6.6 points over Harris. Both recreational and medical cannabis are legal in Massachusetts, but the Bay State could become the third state in the country to legalize some psychedelic drugs, following in the path of Oregon and Colorado. Known as Question 4, the ballot measure would legalize things like psilocybin mushrooms from licensed sellers. Five drugs would become legal dimethyltryptamine (DMT), mescaline, ibogaine, psilocybin, and psilocybin, as long as they were obtained by therapy centers for people 21 years of age and older. Retail shops for these drugs would still be illegal, but the bill would also decriminalize possession of these five drugs for personal use. Recent polling shows voters in Massachusetts evenly split on Question 4, with 43% opposing and 43% supporting, according to a recent survey conducted by the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and WCVB. The 14% of people who are undecided on the question are likely to decide how it goes. “This ballot question only enjoys majoritarian support among a small number of demographic and political groups in the state that include young people, Democrats, liberals and Biden voters,”  Tatishe Nteta, the director of the poll, said in a statement published online. “Older voters, independents, Republicans and parents are particularly opposed to this ballot question, and given the high turnout among these groups in particular, this does not bode well for those who seek to make Massachusetts the third state in the nation to make these substances legal,” Nteta said. The latest polling average from 538 for Massachusetts has Harris ahead 26.2 points over Trump. The good people of Nebraska will vote on two measures regarding cannabis today. Ballot Initiative 437 would let healthcare professionals recommend weed to patients while legalizing the possession and use of cannabis for those residents. And Ballot Initiative 438 would create a Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission to regulate the sale and distribution of the drug. How does it look in the Cornhusker State? According to the latest polling from Midwest Newsroom Emerson College, 59% say they’re going to vote yes, and 33% say they’ll vote no, with 8% unsure, reports Nebraska Public Media. A legal case has sought to throw out all the votes, arguing that there was some kind of fraud going on during the signature collection that allowed the marijuana measures to get on the ballot. But a judge recently ruled that the votes will be counted. A final ruling on the case isn’t expected for about two weeks, meaning that even if the initiatives pass, they could still be invalidated down the line, but at least people will get to have their say on the matter. For now. The latest polling average from 538 for Nebraska has Trump ahead 16.4 points over Harris. As one of the most politically conservative states in the country, it’s no surprise that it hasn’t legalized marijuana for recreational use yet, though it has been legal for medical purposes since 2016. Ballot measures to make recreational use legal failed in 2018 and 2022. But advocates are trying it again this year. North Dakota’s Initiated Measure 5 is appearing on the ballot and would legalize recreational use and possession for any residents 21 years of age and older. If it does pass, adults would be allowed to have up to one ounce of cannabis, four grams of concentrate, and 1,500 milligrams of edibles. How will the proposed change fare this time? The latest polling shows 45% support legalization, 40% are opposed, and 15% are undecided, according to the North Dakota Monitor, which notes that the measure is being supported by an organization called New Economic Frontier, which is trying to promote legalization as a good thing for business and tax revenue growth. But legalization has strong opposition from big conservative organizations like the North Dakota Medical and Hospital Associations, North Dakota Peace Officers, Chiefs of Police Association of North Dakota, and the North Dakota Sheriffs and Deputies Associations. FiveThirtyEight doesn’t have a polling average for North Dakota but the latest poll the outlet tracks has Trump ahead 27 points over Harris. South Dakota’s Initiated Measure 29 will be decided by voters on Tuesday, which would legalize the consumption of recreational weed for anyone 21 years of age and older, though it doesn’t legalize the sale of weed and has a special carve-out allowing employers to ban consumption by their employees. Medical cannabis is already legal in the state. But the latest polling does not look good for people who’d like to see recreational marijuana legalized in South Dakota. A disappointing 50% of voters in the state oppose the measure, with 45% supporting it, according to a poll conducted by Emerson College Polling/KELO-TV/The Hill. FiveThirtyEight doesn’t have a polling average for South Dakota but the latest poll the outlet tracks has Trump ahead 28 points over Harris. Nobody knows for sure what will happen on Tuesday, both for the presidency and these weed legalization measures. But if all four states considering weed today vote to legalize it in some form, there will be just 8 of the 50 states where marijuana is completely illegal. And any one of the four states legalizing would bring the number of states with recreational use up to a full half of the entire country, with 25. If you haven’t voted yet today, wherever you are in the U.S., make sure you do that. This is an important one, to say the least. \n2024 electioncannabisDrugselectionmarijuanavapingweed  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Perplexity AI announced a new Election Information Hub, you should probably ignore it.\n         \n          In a paper published today, scientists argue that plenty of animals are regularly consuming and using alcohol, though many questions about the practice still remain.\n         \n          Soldiers will officially be drug tested for gas station weed and delicious poppy seed muffins.\n         \n          Humans have been getting high since basically the dawn of time.\n         \n          It’s potential evidence of some of the earliest European recreational cocaine use.\n         \n          Along with winds of up to 70 miles per hour (112 kilometers per hour), the tropical storm brought 25 packages of coke ashore.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.
