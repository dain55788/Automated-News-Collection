            "content": "The “True Sensation” dildo is a fleshy, silicone tool that measures exactly 7 inches and has the ability to vibrate (three different frequencies), thrust (seven different speeds), and self-heat (up to 105 degrees Fahrenheit). It’s just like the real thing, James Guo, the founder of Our Erotic Journey, assures me from his office in Irvine, California. Best of all—everything is controlled through the app AMZ. “It connects to someone that’s oceans away,” he says of its potential for creating all kinds of sexual fantasies. Teasingly, he adds: “There’s also music that can match the intensity of the vibration.” True Sensation is just one offering featured among the wide inventory of Our Erotic Journey, the sex toy brand Guo launched in 2019. Its online store, which boasts more than 200 products, is a pleasure chest of sexual self-amusement. Take your pick: There’s the lipstick-shaped vibrator, a remote-controlled rotating butt plug, various cock rings, something called the “Gravity Rocket” (a clitoral suction vibrator with seven massage modes), and a smattering of glow-in-the-dark accessories. “Those are for the ravers,” Guo jokes. The sex tech market is estimated to triple by 2030, exceeding $100 billion globally in sales. The demand for products, from AI-assisted companions and personal wand massagers to sexual wellness apps, sits at an all-time high. At a moment when industry trends favor artificial intelligence and remote sex exploration, Guo just wants to make eccentric, high-quality vibrators. He’s betting big on toys. In the years since launch, Guo has built Our Erotic Journey into a quietly influential brand through intentionally whimsical designs and an insistence on quality products. “I know production,” Guo says. His family, he tells me, owns an auto-parts factory in China, and what he learned from the business—how the factory system runs, the science of machines, what style of packaging attracts customers—he leveraged for OEJ. Guo admits that the initial product line—about 20 toys, of which the Sec Duo vibrator for couples remains a company best-seller—was devised to “fit the market.” “We self developed the first batch through modding, R&D, scaling, all that stuff,” he says. “Everything since that represents more of who we are.” That’s how OEJ’s six themed collections came to be. The Cristal collection is for glass toys while the Space, Thrillz, and Lit collections are for truly uninhibited pleasure seekers (one features a dildo called “The Girthquake,” that exploits a specific, if sometimes worn out, racial fantasy). But where Guo, who is 35, sometimes falls short in imagination, he more than makes up for in vigilance. “Users expect and deserve products that meet stringent safety standards, and any deviation can damage a brand’s reputation irrevocably,” he posted in an XBIZ editorial in September. “Partner with trusted white-label manufacturers rather than gamble on the unknowns.” When I ask Guo about the editorial, he stresses that the success of sex tech is determined as much by the innovation involved in the products as the quality. “We want to be more of a bridge from human to human,” Guo says, “not just from toy to human.” Even with promising market projections—another estimate goes so far as to predict sales could surpass $121 billion in the next six years—industry analysts are not convinced that the future of sex tech is in toys. It’s a “very oversaturated market that is now avoided by many,” says Olena Petrosyuk, a partner at the consulting firm Waveup. This year, she adds, investors “are looking away from ‘commoditized’ trends”—sex toys, but also sex content and social platforms. “Many failed to prove the economics and scale. The category is still fairly stigmatized,” she says. “OnlyFans being a massive exception.” So what do consumers want? Petrosyuk says wellness, AI, and immersive realities are hot right now. “Practically every new sex tech startup is thinking in terms of AI use cases,” she says. “If it’s AI toys—companies are looking into how they can anticipate and respond to the user’s needs. If it’s robotics—we see companies looking into sex bots. If it’s content—it’s hyperpersonalized sex personas.” Guo tells me he is not phased by talk of AI sex robots—“a low-volume business,” in his estimation—because many people cannot afford the high price tag. Steady growth, he believes, will happen by expanding on the company’s themed collections. Next year, OEJ plans to launch a Zodiac collection, crafting 12 unique toys for each astrological sign. It’s an appeal to the Co–Star fanatics of Gen Z. “Every generation is different,” he says. The company’s mostly nonexistent social media presence only seems to add to their Wonka-like mystery. “We’re just bad at it,” Jerry Chen, an operations assistant, admits. “We’re really focused on production.” OEJ works directly with US and Canadian distributors; it is not a direct-to-consumer business, though Guo says customers do occasionally order via the online store. Even as ecommerce has become the industry standard in retail and electronics, taking more of an old-school approach works for Guo. For now, that business model seems to be a hit. Our Erotic Journey recently won the “Best Pleasure Product Manufacturer—Small” prize at the 2023–2024 AVN Awards in Las Vegas, a litmus test for newbie brands in the adult content world. OEJ also received the O Award for Outstanding New Product for “Sexy Pot,” a marijuana-leaf-shaped vibrator, and a customer favorite. Clearly wanting to capitalize on its unexpected success, Guo says, “It’s time we gave it a sister or brother.” In your inbox: Upgrade your life with WIRED-tested gear A bitcoin mining dream turned into a nightmare The Big Interview: Marissa Mayer—I am a software girl I made a wholesome OnlyFans to try to make ends meet Event: Join us for The Big Interview on December 3 in San Francisco More From WIRED Reviews and Guides © 2024 Condé Nast.

            "description": "Ahead of the election, anti-government militias are using Facebook to recruit, coordinate training, and promote ballot box stakeouts. Meta isn’t shutting their groups down and is even auto-generating pages.",

            "content": "“Many of us are pissed,” wrote the “commander” of a Three Percenter militia in Kentucky in a post. “We need to have a location all patriots from all states can come to when the time comes,” he continued. “Thoughts?” Other militia members replied, affirming their readiness. “It’s time the enemy paid a price for their treason and crimes against humanity,” one person responded. These plans for militia activity in the wake of the US election are not from a private conversation on an encrypted platform. It was unfolding on a public Facebook profile. Anti-government militia movements have been continuing to use Facebook to recruit, coordinate training, promote ballot box stake outs, and prepare for a civil war that many militants believe will break out after election day. And in some cases, the movement is attracting people who don’t appear to have any prior background in a militia. Meta is even doing the work for extremist movements by auto-generating some group pages on their behalf. Data shared exclusively with WIRED by the Tech Transparency Project shows that these groups have only continued to grow on Facebook, despite WIRED previously flagging this lapse in Meta’s moderation. The brazen proliferation of paramilitary activity on the social media platform days before the election highlights Meta’s lackadaisical approach to enforcing its own bans against groups it has labeled dangerous extremists. Militias require platforms like Facebook to grow: It’s a tool for the paramilitary movement to strengthen and radicalize its network. It also helps them facilitate local organizing, state by state and county by county, and boost their membership. The American paramilitary movement is much less visible than it was in 2020. Militias largely retreated from the streets after the January 6 Capitol riot exposed them to intense public and legal scrutiny, which was intensified by the prosecution of dozens of Oath Keepers. Some groups tried to distance themselves from the movement altogether by dropping any language about a “militia” from their websites, opting instead for more euphemistic names like “civilian guard” and “patriot group.” But after the dust settled following the Capitol riot, the movement began quietly rebuilding on Facebook. And they ramped up training and began coordinating, across counties and states. The Tech Transparency Project has compiled a list of 262 Facebook public and private groups and 193 Facebook pages for militia and anti-government activists that were created since January 6, 2021. Nearly two dozen of those groups and pages have been created since May, according to the TTP. Some make minimal effort to conceal their affiliations to extremist networks: One new public group created in May is called The Michigan III%. Increasingly, the movement is also relying on individual profiles associated with leaders of local militia, the TTP says. Moderation has put a dent in the presence of American Patriots Three Percent (AP3), one of the largest active militias that Facebook explicitly banned in 2020 as a “militarized social movement” and “armed militia group.” Meta, Facebook's parent company, says it carried out a “strategic network disruption” of AP3 in 2020 and again earlier this year in June, removing from Facebook and Instagram a total of 900 groups, pages, and accounts associated with members. \"Adversaries are constantly trying to find new ways around our policies, which is why we continually enforce against violating groups and accounts by investing heavily in people, technology, research, and partnerships,” a Meta spokesperson told WIRED in an email. “We will continue to remove any groups and accounts that violate our policies.” Meta says the company is investigating some of the screenshots of groups that WIRED shared and will remove any content that violates its policies. But WIRED reviewed posts from AP3 groups and profiles that are still on the platform, including examples where members and leaders brandish AP3 insignia and share photos from their in-person training sessions. There have also been some recent instances where Facebook has even auto-generated pages for militias. In May, Facebook auto-generated a page for AP3’s Arizona chapter. In June, Facebook auto-generated a page for “AP3 NM [New Mexico] Training Range.” If you hover over the information widget on the page, Facebook’s explainer reads: “This unofficial page was created because people on Facebook have shown interest in this place or business. It’s not affiliated with or endorsed by anyone associated with AP3 Training Range.” WIRED sent Meta two examples of auto-generated pages. In a statement, the company said: \"One of the two auto-generated Pages had one follower and has been removed, and we couldn’t even verify that the second example of an auto-generated Page exists on the platform.\" Meta has repeatedly come under fire in the past for auto-generating pages for extremist, white supremacist, and terrorist organizations; a whistleblower first flagged the issue in 2020 in a supplement to an earlier petition filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Nearly four years after the January 6 attack on the capitol, Facebook remains a significant recruiting and organizing tool for militias like the AP3, despite creating policies that ban them,” said Katie Paul, director of the Tech Transparency Project. “How can Meta be trusted to effectively thwart extremists that have a record of engaging in and stoking political violence when its own systems create business pages for them?” In a video from 2022 that was recently published as part of a leak to Distributed Denial of Secrets, AP3 leader Scot Seddon stressed the importance of Facebook to his group’s operational success. “We’ve always used Facebook, Facebook has been our greatest weapon. It has gotten us where we are today,” Seddon told the camera. “We need to use the tools that are in front of us to achieve the goals of where we want to be. Our goal is to network, be as big as possible, have as many like-minded patriots in our states that we can rely upon should shit hit the fan.” Extremist groups need access to mainstream platforms like Facebook to reach and radicalize people. When those groups are banned from larger platforms and relegated to fringe sites, their reach and recruitment opportunities are limited and their numbers can become stagnant or start dropping. “We know the power of Facebook as an organizing platform, to pull in people who have fallen down rabbit holes and radicalize them further,” says Jon Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. “We should be concerned that actual organized domestic extremist groups have free rein on platforms that millions of Americans use.” Now, as the election fast approaches, the paramilitary network on Facebook has been a hive of people looking to link up, train, and prepare. A review by WIRED of recent Facebook posts in a number of these militia groups also suggests that the paramilitary movement has lately been attracting individuals who don’t have previous experience of being part of a militia. “I’m looking for a group of people that see and understand the dire situation our country is in,” wrote one poster in the Facebook group U.S.A. Militia We The People last month. “A group of people that understand that civil war is at our doorstep if Kamala makes it into office. Am I in the right place?” In another post earlier this month in a group for a county-level militia in Virginia, a member shared that he and his wife were interested in joining up, before asking for more information about how to do so. Also earlier this month, a new member of a militia group in Oklahoma introduced himself as a military veteran and said he was a member of a militia from 2015 to 2017 but wants to get involved again. “My battle rattle is ready to go any time,” he added. Two county-level militias in Virginia have created Facebook pages in the past month, which they’ve used to coordinate their inaugural “musters” (militia speak for a meetup) in recent weeks. Another local Virginia militia has organized a meeting for two days after the election. The “commander” of a Three Percenter group in Kentucky—who posed for a photograph viewed by WIRED with Representative Thomas Massie last summer while wearing full gear and insignia—has used his profile to share images from training sessions and regularly makes inflammatory statements. In a recent post, he suggested that state militias ought to rally at their chosen state parks: “Three national base camps could be state or national parks … (for example) west in NV or CO, central Missouri and east WV or VA. Then get comms established.” In a “Patriot Group” in Barron County, Wisconsin, a recent lively discussion led by a “top contributor” urged members to “organize and monitor” ballot drop boxes. Several members of the group proposed planting small cameras in the vicinity of the boxes. Ballot drop surveillance has continued to be a hot topic of discussion among election deniers and paramilitary groups. Militias also teamed up with election deniers to conduct covert surveillance of ballot drop boxes during the midterm elections, recent leaks published by Distributed Denial of Secrets and reported by WIRED show. A recent DHS intelligence memo warned law enforcement agencies that domestic extremists could try to sabotage or attack ballot boxes. The administrator of a New Hampshire–based group called the MAGA Continental Army claims that he recently met with the local police chief to discuss preparations in the event that a civil war breaks out. “He told me if it came to civil war that he will be directing his officers to defend the people—they will not be coming after your guns,” he wrote. He added that the chief said all members should come to the police department if conflict broke out. In one public group called The Party of Trump, with 171,000 members, a discussion about ballot drop box monitoring prompted someone to suggest that Trump supporters come armed with their AR-15s to stand guard. In another public group called We Fight for Our Lives, someone urged others to get organized ahead of the election and suggested enlisting bikers and militia. “I’m ready to fight,” one person responded. “I’ll pull the fuckin trigger fo sho” the original poster added. In another public group called SAVE THE FLAG AMERICA, someone put the stakes of the election in bleak terms: “In a matter of days, we will ascertain our financial capacity to procure essential commodities such as groceries and fuel, or, alternatively face the prospect of engaging in armed conflict.” “Trump 2024,” someone responded. “God is always in control.” This story has been updated with additional comment from Meta.

            "content": "This Halloween, crowds lined the streets in central Dublin and waited for a parade to begin. They’d gathered after a website called MySpiritHalloween.com published an AI-generated article promoting the festivities. The post promised “spectacular floats to thrilling street performances” and described the route in detail. The parade never came—but the spectacle of throngs of people milling around for nothing became an event unto itself. Afterward, the incident went viral as an example of AI slop seeping into the real world. Since the generative AI boom began, a class of SEO entrepreneurs has started pumping out AI-generated content on websites and across social platforms, in efforts to make money off online advertising and affiliate marketing. MySpiritHalloween.com owner Nazir Ali is one of them. WIRED spoke with Ali via Google Meet to get his side of the story. He insists it’s all just a big misunderstanding. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Nazir Ali: Ask anything. Kate Knibbs: Well, how are you doing? I am actually good, but we are highly embarrassed. We are highly depressed that everyone is reporting against us. They're calling us scammers, saying that we scammed. This was not on purpose! Can you explain what happened? The thing is, we are the content creators. I am the owner of a SEO agency. We make websites and we rank them on Google. We hired some content writers online, and they helped us out on all the Halloween events throughout the world: in the USA, in UK, and most importantly, Ireland. If there are any mistakes, for example you see an event and it was moved—there were some events in Dubai, but hotel management texted us and said that the event was not listed, so we removed it immediately. But no one reported that this one wasn’t going to happen. As soon as we knew, we changed it. We even wrote this has been canceled, but it was too late. I want to ask about the AI of it all— I’ll explain it to you. You can easily write a whole website with AI. But it is not easy to rank on Google’s first page, and our site was ranked on the first page. It was even on the first position of the first page. Okay, AI was involved. We asked ChatGPT to write the article for us, but it wasn’t ChatGPT by itself. So we took help from AI, we took help from ChatGPT, but we optimized that ourselves. So there was a human editor? Exactly, yes, we humanized it. Definitely. You cannot rank through AI content alone. AI was involved 10 percent or 20 percent. We were 80 percent involved. And we apologize to our Irish brothers. We are highly disappointed, highly embarrassed, and honestly, we are feeling bad. Dubliners awaiting a Halloween parade that never showed up. How many other websites do you have? I own five websites. And actually, I want to tell you one more thing. Are you familiar with St. Patrick’s Day? Yes. We wrote a lot of events this year, on the 17th of March, St. Patrick’s Day—and they were ranked. People even congratulated us. They thanked us for listing events about St Patrick's Day. No event was reported as bogus, or AI-generated, or anything like that. We try our best to give people authentic content. We don't actually want to mislead any of our Irish brothers. This was just a mistake. And you guys should not say that we are the scammers, unless you actually know it, unless you ask us. This is why I am here to clarify things. I appreciate that. We own this mistake. So your name is Nazir Ali, but when you say “we”— We are not going to give you any personal information that might be harmful for us. Everyone is writing about us, and they are telling us that we are scammers. Would you be comfortable telling me about the reports that you’re based in Pakistan? Is that true? We hire some of the content creators, and one is from Pakistan, and others are from some other countries. But I don't want to actually reveal their nationalities. People will blame the country if I say I'm from Dubai, then whenever you write an article, if you say that a guy from Pakistan, a guy from India, guy from Ireland, a guy from the UAE, it actually hurts some of the citizens of that country. Would you be comfortable telling me how long you’ve had this Halloween website? You will be shocked to know that we ranked our site in three months on the Google first page. So you've only been in operation for three months? Yes. Why holiday events? It’s a huge topic, but only for one day. So it is easy for us to generate revenue for that one day—then we don't have to put in effort throughout the year. We just do work for three or four months, and then we'll get the revenue. Could you explain more about your business model. How do you make money? Our business model is Google Ads. Google Ads and affiliate marketing. Has this made you reconsider the ways that you operate? Will you change how you use AI going forward? It is our mistake. We should double check it. Not only double, but triple check it. One more thing I want to add is that people should not consider Google as the standard. Google is just a search engine, and any person can post anything on it. Don't just believe it. Just cross check! Are you concerned that Google will downrank you now? Definitely. We are expecting Google will derank. Is there anything you could try to do to prevent that? No, there is nothing. And this is because of all the misinformation provided by the journalists. They don't actually know what our intentions are, but they are showing that our intentions are wrong. But right now the guys are very depressed. Listen to me. If we wanted to scam people, we can easily do so by selling fake tickets. But we never mentioned any tickets on the website. That would be very simple, but we didn't even mention the ticket thing. Well, I’m glad you didn’t do that. Then we would be scammers, but we don’t do it, because it is illegal and prohibited. How much money do you make off SEO? It is very personal, and it depends on the traffic. Ballpark? One more thing is that we posted around 1,400 articles. It is not easy to post 1,400 articles in three months and to make them rank in Google. This shows that this is a mistake. This is not a scam. We have other articles, we have other websites. We never had this type of issue before. In addition to the St. Patrick's Day websites, what are some of the other websites you’re running? Actually, there are few others about animals. Another niche is about SEO, and how you can be an SEO expert, but I’m not going to reveal those. OK. Is there anything else you think people have gotten wrong about you? I just want to say that people should not judge so soon. They should go through some of the processes—they can contact me, contact our team. They should ask us questions. They can be harsh, they can be rude. But we are not wrong, and we are not scammers. That’s it.

            "content": "Late in his team’s game against the Green Bay Packers on September 15, Indianapolis Colts tight end Kylen Granson caught a short pass over the middle of the field, charged forward, and lowered his body to brace for contact. The side of his helmet smacked the face mask of linebacker Quay Walker, and the back of it whacked the ground as Walker wrestled him down. Rising to his feet after the 9-yard gain, Granson tossed the football to an official and returned to the line of scrimmage for the next snap. Aside from it being his first reception of the 2024 National Football League season, this otherwise ordinary play was only noteworthy because of what Granson was wearing at the time of the hit: a 12-ounce, foam-padded, protective helmet covering called a Guardian Cap. Already mandatory for most positions at all NFL preseason practices, as well as regular-season and postseason practices with contact, these soft shells received another vote of confidence this year when the league greenlit them for optional game use, citing a roughly 50 percent drop in training camp concussions since their official 2022 debut. Through six weeks of action this fall, only 10 NFL players had actually taken the field with one on, according to a league spokesperson. But the decision was easy for Granson, who tried out his gameday Guardian Cap—itself covered by a 1-ounce pinnie with the Colts logo to simulate the design of the helmet underneath—in preseason games before committing to wear it for real. “I was pleasantly surprised that it didn’t affect anything for me,” the 26-year-old told WIRED a few days before facing the Packers in week two. “I thought, even if it looks kind of silly, it’s worth it.” There is no ignoring the goofy aesthetics of the puffy, blobby Guardian Caps. The product’s parent company, Guardian Sports, even has staff T-shirts that declare, LOOK GOOD, FEEL GOOD, PLAY GOOD—with LOOK GOOD crossed out. “Condom caps, mushroom heads—we’ve heard them all,” says Erin Hanson, cofounder of Guardian Sports alongside her husband, Lee Hanson. “We just laugh, because we agree.” It can be tough to square the reality that the apparent future of football headgear resembles something out of a ’60s-era sci-fi movie. But the fact that Guardian Caps are now allowed at all in games in the NFL—a league known for policing every inch of player equipment to protect its image—doesn’t just speak to their lab-tested utility (even if published, peer-reviewed on-field data remains lacking). It also reflects the urgency of the moment for football at large. The dangers of strapping on a helmet have never been clearer, given the link between repeated blows to the head—whether concussion-causing or not—and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (otherwise known as CTE, a brain disorder associated with cognitive issues like depression and progressive dementia that can only be diagnosed posthumously). Not coincidentally, the race to find answers has become faster and more lucrative than ever, between the NFL’s funding of private research efforts and a rapidly innovating football headgear industry. And at the center of it all, on the sport’s biggest stage, is a literal mom-and-pop shop that, less than a decade and a half ago, was struggling to find a foothold in football as anything but a joke. The story of the Guardian Cap starts in 1996, some 15 years before its invention. Settled in the Atlanta area with their then-four children, Erin, a former middle-school math teacher, and Lee, a chemical engineer, teamed up to found The Hanson Group, a business-to-business provider of chemical materials. Specializing in polyurethanes and epoxies, the company has since built, among other things, transparent body shields for the US Army, coatings of fuel tank plates for Boeing airplanes, and the outer layers of multiple brands of golf balls. Then, in 2010, the Hansons were contacted out of the blue by an industrial designer named Bert Straus, who decades earlier had created a padded helmet attachment, the ProCap, that was worn in games by a handful of NFL players. Explaining that he was working on a new type of headgear, a hard-shell helmet with interior padding as well as a ProCap-esque soft shell mounted on top, Straus enlisted The Hanson Group to make the integral skin foam for this cushioned outer layer. That winter, the trio traveled to a hotel ballroom in Manhattan and presented their product to NFL officials as part of a special league committee meeting on helmet safety. Even with live testimony provided by former Buffalo Bills safety Mark Kelso, who wore a ProCap for four-plus seasons in the early ’90s, the attempt to convince the NFL of the potential of soft-shell technology was not well-received, the Hansons recall. “That lit a fire under us,” Erin says. Convinced that the best market opportunity lay with a one-size-fits-all option that could retrofit existing helmets at every level of football, as opposed to the brand- and model-specific ProCap, Erin and Lee struck out on their own. But the biggest difference in their eventual prototype had to do with how it was attached to the helmet in the first place: Its straps looped around the facemask and fastened to themselves, thereby loosely “floating” on top of the helmet rather than affixing directly via sticky-backed tabs. The result was what the Hansons would later summarize in their United States patent request as a “protective helmet cap” with “a durable energy absorbing outer shell, which lessens the initial impact to the helmet … [and] an inner surface that allows the outer shell to slide over the surface of a helmet thereby reducing forces applied to a wearer.” As development continued throughout 2011, Erin and Lee used money from The Hanson Group to send the caps away for independent drop testing—a longtime headgear industry standard in which a helmet-wearing dummy head is dropped onto a modular elastomer pad for measuring impact and shock absorption—at accredited sites like Oregon Ballistic Laboratories, ICS Laboratories, and the Southern Impact Research Center. They also shelled out for additional outside testing to ensure that the caps wouldn’t affect neck torque and that they maintained a lower coefficient of friction relative to the usual football helmet’s polycarbonate shell, to ensure that crucial “sliding” effect. “Over the years, we’ve spent a couple hundred grand on testing, because we did so much before we put them on the field,” Erin says. “The whole goal was to help, and it was certainly to not hurt, so we had to vet the product.” Initially branding themselves as POC Ventures—the acronym stood for “protecting our children”—the Hansons launched publicly at the January 2012 convention of the American Football Coaches Association in San Antonio. The goal was to sell caps and eventually attract an established sports equipment company to buy them out. Instead, Erin says, what few attendees dared approach their booth weren’t exactly warm. “You’re sissifying football,” Erin says, recounting one reaction. “That’s the stupidest thing in the world,” Lee says of another. But they soon found their first big believer. That year, at a medical conference in Destin, Florida, the Hansons met Jeffrey Guy, a physician for the University of South Carolina athletic department, who later looked at the caps’ testing data and came away impressed enough for the Gamecocks football team—including future first-overall NFL pick Jadeveon Clowney—to start using them in their 2013 summer practices. Naturally it wasn’t long before one of South Carolina’s biggest rivals, Clemson, had placed orders too. “It really was one team giving it a shot, and it just kept spreading,” Erin says. Along the way, the Hansons abandoned the POC Ventures name after receiving a strongly worded letter from the Swedish cycling and snow sport helmet manufacturer POC, settling on Guardian and a halo logo as reflections of their religious faith. (They later switched the latter, too, to an angel’s wing.) Their belief in their business mission was soon rewarded in April 2017, when the rechristened company was anointed as a winner of an NFL-sponsored research competition for protective football equipment, the HeadHealthTECH challenge, receiving $20,000 to fund future biomechanical testing for their Guardian Caps. The Hansons were back in the door. Technically speaking, Erin and Lee never saw their grand prize. Rather, the money ended up being routed directly to Biokinetics, an Ottawa-based laboratory that partners with the NFL for helmet testing. The results were then analyzed by Biocore, a biomechanical engineering firm out of Charlottesville, Virginia, that also acts as a league consultant for player equipment, including helmets. At the time, the lone model of the Guardian Cap was the Guardian XT, a 7-ounce soft shell then already popular with a growing handful of elite college programs and hundreds of high school teams nationwide. But the results didn’t measure up under lab conditions simulating the higher speeds and masses of professional football hits. “We didn’t really find that it had much of an effect on the NFL impact environment,” says Ann Bailey Good, a senior engineer at Biocore. So the Hansons added an extra layer of padding to the XTs to create a beefier version, the 12-ounce Guardian NXT (with the N standing for NFL). It fared much better. For a 2021 article published in Annals of Biomedical Engineering, five authors—Bailey Good, two Biocore colleagues, and two other engineers who regularly consult for the NFL Players’ Association—subjected their crash dummy helmets to two main tests. The first involved hitting them with a pneumatic ram at speeds and points of impact that were determined in part through video review of concussion-causing plays among linemen during past NFL games. The second, for which the collision sites were picked to minimize face mask interaction and thus maximize helmet-on-helmet exposure, saw dummies with NXTs crash into each other with the aid of an electric belt-driven sled. The results were assembled using the Head Acceleration Response Metric (HARM), a formula that Biocore, the NFLPA's engineering consultants, and several other researchers helped develop. for measuring the severity of an impact and how that correlates to helmet safety and performance. On average, as the study found, the addition of a Guardian NXT was reduced HARM by 9 percent over control helmets with no caps; by comparison, its competition in the study, the ProTech—a modernized version of the ProCap—only reduced HARM by an average of 5 percent. Two aggregate scores were also calculated, by weighing test conditions based on how often those types of impacts occurred to actual NFL linemen and how many reported concussions were sustained due to those impacts. The NXT performed similarly well here, leading the study to conclude that the “Results … suggest that using the GC NXT may reduce the head impact severity exposure for linemen.” “That’s really when it started to become a thing in the league,” Bailey Good says now. The NFL soon brought the Guardian Cap to its Health and Safety Committee, a group of mostly team-, league-, and union-affiliated doctors, and to its Competition Committee, a rules-making body of coaches and team executives appointed by commissioner Roger Goodell. “We talked about the benefits we saw,” says Jeff Miller, an NFL executive vice president overseeing health and player safety. The next year, in 2022, the caps were rolled out for something of a trial period as the Competition Committee recommended that club owners vote to mandate them at preseason practices for select positions that according to league data had sustained the “most frequent head impacts” (offensive and defensive linemen, tight ends, and linebackers) during practice, Miller says. The mandate also only lasted for a four-week stretch when the “greatest density of concussions” had historically occurred—from the start of training camp to the second preseason game. As the Guardian Caps gained more exposure thanks to the NFL’s endorsement, increasing outside research helped shed more light on how they function. “I think it seems logical to most folks: If you cover your whole head in a massive pillow, maybe that’d help you more,” says Nicholas Cecchi, a colead author on a 2023 study at Stanford University that in part performed similar lab impact tests on a version of the Guardian XT as Biocore did with the NXT several years prior. “But there’s more to how it works that didn’t seem intuitive.” In particular, Cecchi, who was a PhD student in bioengineering at the time of the study, cites the “sliding” effect produced by the Guardian Caps’ design. “It really did seem like their main effectiveness was coming from the reduced surface friction on the exterior, and then also the decoupling of different layers,” he says. In other words, the Guardian Cap isn’t just a hat on a hat; the two-part, add-on system has its benefits. When a helmet hit happens, says Cecchi, “you’ve got linear forces and rotational forces. Linear are going to be reduced by compression of the materials. Rotational forces will be reduced by the shearing and sliding of the different materials. The more that happens, the more it’ll absorb the rotation, so less rotation will be experienced by your head. “From the lab tests, it seemed very clear, in almost all scenarios, the Guardian Cap reduced the magnitude of those rotational accelerations, and other metrics linked to football-related injury risks, by a good amount.” Less conclusive is the data regarding how the Guardian Caps perform on the actual field. In addition to their lab component, Cecchi and his colleagues used instrumented mouth guards to look at helmet-to-helmet impacts sustained by a handful of linebackers on Stanford’s football team in practices over two seasons: in 2019, when players wore bare helmets, and in 2021, when Guardian Caps were mandatory. “We did not observe any significant reductions in any measure of impact severity after implementation of the padded helmet shell cover,” the study concluded. Similarly, in 2022, at the University of North Carolina, sensor-equipped helmets logged 14 full-contact practices among 10 players: five with Guardian Caps and five who opted to not wear them. As researchers later wrote in a late-2023 report for the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, the coverings “did not affect head impact kinematic outcomes.” But these studies also categorized their on-field findings as “preliminary” and “pilot,” respectively, in part due to the obvious small sample sizes. Here again, Biocore, backed by the NFL, is leading the way: According to Bailey Good, a paper unpacking the Guardian Caps’ effect in their first two years of preseason practice use—in particular the league’s touted 50 percent drop in concussions among linemen, tight ends, and linebackers, from an average of 35 in 2018, 2019, and 2021 to 18 during this last postseason—was submitted “a few months ago” and is currently being peer reviewed. “We certainly considered other things like number of practices, practice intensity, et cetera,” Bailey Good says. “But looking at the results that we saw in the preseason related to concussions, it was very promising.” Meaningful game data will take even longer to surface; the NCAA has yet to formally approve Guardian Caps for games at the college level, and while the National Federation of State High School Associations has allowed them in both practices and games since 2013, few examples of the latter exist. But the Hansons reject the idea that further testing is required to judge the credentials of their creation. “We didn't just develop this three months ago—it’s been out on the field for 12 years,” Lee says. “I know it's anecdotal data, but what everyone tells us is that they feel better, they play better, and they have reductions in the numbers of injuries.” At the same time, the Hansons are sensitive to what they see as a common overstatement of the caps’ capabilities. “We do not talk about reducing concussions,” Erin says. “Science can only measure reduction of impact, reduction of forces. How that relates to brain injuries—there's a lot of unknowns that are still out there. Is it responsible to say this is the panacea for all? No, it's not going to fix everything. “But do we know they’re making a difference? Hell yeah.” More and more appear to be agreeing every day. Sitting in a conference room at the Guardian Sports offices in late August, Erin hits Play on a voice memo that a new client from Denver recently sent to Guardian’s national sales manager. “This is a good one,” she says, as a familiar southern twang comes through the speaker: “Hey … this is Peyton Manning calling … I coach an eighth-grade youth football team … and I was thinking I wanted to maybe ask about ordering some Guardian Caps … I feel like it’s the right thing to do.” Two football helmets bake in the afternoon sun atop a picnic table, one wearing a Guardian Cap and the other bare. The Hansons put them here, outside the entrance to their company’s headquarters in a suburban business park northeast of Atlanta, as a practical demonstration of how the coverings, at 90-plus degree temperatures, can help insulate the helmet from outside heat. (Miller says that NFL testing has backed this up.) Bearing an angel’s wing logo on the front, the black-walled building is a 90,000-square-foot facility that Guardian Sports splits with The Hanson Group. Together it is a family operation in the most literal sense: Out of close to 50 employees between the two sides, 10 are members of the Hanson clan, including three of Erin and Lee’s now-five children and two sons-in-law. It took almost a full decade for Guardian Sports to become financially self-sustaining, and even longer to finish paying back The Hanson Group for the seven-figure costs of external lab testing and an early bulk purchase of more than 100,000 caps—that happened just last year. But the bustling scene suggests that business is good today. In the warehouse, towering stacks of Guardian Caps inventory have overtaken what was once an employee exercise area, like cubed cardboard weeds. In the loading dock, a truck drops off a fresh supply of green and maroon caps air-shipped from the company’s factory in Dongguan, China after their stockpile of those colors ran out. When it comes to the Guardian Cap, the XTs sell for about $70 at retail stores and online but less than $55 in group orders for teams, while the NXTs are only sold direct to teams at an average of $100 apiece. According to the company, some 77 percent of its overall sales happens in bulk. But only a small portion of that total—about 200,000 caps sold this year, the company projects—comes from the NFL’s 32 teams, each of which typically stocks about 100 per season, replacing them every one to two years depending on the position and wear. Not counting the cost of NFL testing through Biocore, though, Erin says Guardian has “never received a dime” directly from the league. Adds Lee, “They own the data too—only when they publish it, we get to see it.” But the benefit of having a public stamp of approval in the shape of the NFL shield is obvious. “We had to have outside validation, and that’s what the NFL has done for us,” Erin says. “You can’t put a value on the marketing that you get from your product. But they’re not writing us checks, that’s for sure.” On the flip side, the company has already done more for the NFL than its owners ever imagined. “The last thing we ever wanted to be in was the customization business,” Erin says, referring to the nine months it took to create the Guardian Cap pinnies that matched the helmets of every team so they could be worn in games this season. Between designing the concepts, conducting testing through Biocore, enlisting two college teams (Colorado and Georgia) to pilot them at spring practice, and ensuring the proper pantones and logos—all but four sent the initial batch back, including the Carolina Panthers, who requested that the silver pinnie “sparkle more,” Erin says—every step was geared toward aesthetic goals. Asked if it was a necessary headache to collaborate with the league, Lee replies immediately: “Yes.” Adds Erin, “If it allows a player who feels like he's getting the same benefit in a game as in practice, then it's worth it.” To this end, Guardian recently completed production on versions 2.0 of both the XT and NXT caps, featuring flatter, more helmetlike exteriors onto which teams can iron on logo decals. “The barriers to gameplay, I think, are the lack of gameplay testing data and the aesthetics,” says chief operating officer Jake Hanson, Erin and Lee’s son. “The more we can get at those with the 2.0s, the better.” Given the relative lack of caps in NFL stadiums so far this season, it seems unlikely that they can catch on as a widespread gameday add-on. But even their future in practice remains uncertain. “The Guardian Cap could be a transition as we move from good helmets to better helmets, as that technology continues to improve,” Miller says. That time might already be here: Entering this season, Biocore approved six new helmet models that would allow any player who wore one to be exempt from the Guardian Cap practice mandate. And more than 200 players have already taken advantage of the carve-out, “an unprecedented rate of adoption for a new piece of equipment,” NFL chief medical officer Allen Sills said on a media call in early October. To both the lab and the league, the decision here boiled down to incentivizing players to use better-performing helmets. “Decreasing benefit to wearing it, to the point where some of the technology that the helmets have now made the addition of a Guardian Cap on top of it of less utility than it would’ve been with one of the other helmets,” Miller says, when asked why the coverings were made optional at all. “And eventually you get to the plus-minus of, well, you’re adding a bunch of ounces to your head.” Should the Hansons buck the odds once more and become a bigger NFL game-day presence down the line, it might be former players turned coaches leading the way. Like Manning. Or former running back and fellow Hall of Famer Jerome Bettis, an early proponent who bought Guardian Caps for an Atlanta-area youth football league that he and ex-Pittsburgh Steelers teammate Tim Lester started for their sons in the mid-2010s. “You'll get these comments about, how can you put these things in the game?” Erin says. “Then you have interactions with people who are actually living the repercussions, it's a whole different thing.” As for one of the few current players to have embraced the Guardian Caps in games, the Colts’ Granson doesn’t see himself stopping anytime soon. “A big hit’s gonna happen—that’s the inevitability of the game,” he says. “But if I can reduce the contact of the little hits, then that’ll spare me down the road.” In your inbox: Upgrade your life with WIRED-tested gear A bitcoin mining dream turned into a nightmare The Big Interview: Marissa Mayer—I am a software girl I made a wholesome OnlyFans to try to make ends meet Event: Join us for The Big Interview on December 3 in San Francisco More From WIRED Reviews and Guides © 2024 Condé Nast.

            "content": "For months, billionaire and X owner Elon Musk has used his platform to share election conspiracy theories that could undermine faith in the outcome of the 2024 election. Last week, the political action committee (PAC) Musk backs took it a step further, launching a group on X called the Election Integrity Community. The group has nearly 50,000 members and says that it is meant to be a place where users can “share potential incidents of voter fraud or irregularities you see while voting in the 2024 election.” In practice, it is a cesspool of election conspiracy theories, alleging everything from unauthorized immigrants voting to misspelled candidate names on ballots. “It's just an election denier jamboree,” says Paul Barrett, deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University, who authored a recent report on how social media facilitates political violence. Since endorsing former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump following the first assassination attempt against him in July, Musk has become one of Trump’s most important financial backers, pouring more than $100 million into the America PAC since July. The PAC has also been a pillar of the Trump campaign’s ground game in swing states. WIRED reporting found that Blitz Canvassing, a contractor for the PAC, was threatening canvassers in Michigan, and transporting them in U-Hauls. Earlier in October, Musk appeared at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he repeated false claims that Democrats would allow undocumented immigrants to vote illegally, and encouraged Trump’s supporters to vote. In January 2021, the company then known as Twitter banned Trump’s account for incitement to violence during the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. But since taking over and rebranding it as X, Musk has fired many of the people on the teams that worked to keep mis- and disinformation off the platform. Last year, X fired much of what remained of its elections integrity team. After the news broke, Musk posted on X, saying, “Oh you mean the ‘Election Integrity’ Team that was undermining election integrity? Yeah, they’re gone.” Barrett says that the America PAC’s Election Integrity Community group augments the work of other election-denying groups, like former Trump adviser Cleta Mitchell’s Election Integrity Network. “This is a parallel anti-election, anti-democracy campaign designed to sow confusion and lay the groundwork for baseless objections to elections after Election Day. This is going on all across the country, and it's extremely dangerous,” says Barrett. “And we're going to see the results of it almost immediately when the polls close on November 5th.”  Inside the group, multiple accounts shared a viral video of a person ripping up ballots, allegedly from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, which US intelligence agencies have said is fake. Another account shared a video from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones alleging that unauthorized immigrants were being bussed to polling locations to vote. One video shared multiple times, and also purportedly from Buck County, shows a voter confronting a woman with a “voter protection” tag on a lanyard who tells the woman filming that she is there for “early vote monitoring” and asks not to be recorded. Text in the accompanying post says that there were “long lines and early cut offs” and alleges election interference. That post has been viewed more than 1 million times. Some accounts merely retweet local news stories, or right-wing influencers like Lara Loomer and Jack Posobiec, rather than sharing their own personal experiences. One account merely reshared a post from Sidney Powell, the disgraced lawyer who attempted to help Trump overturn the 2020 election, in which she says that voting machines in Wisconsin connect to the internet, and therefore could be tampered with. In actuality, voting machines are difficult to hack. Many of the accounts reference issues in swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. But Barrett says that the real value of this group, and others like it, is not necessarily to collect or verify actual issues at polling places or with voting machines—things that can, and do, happen in a normal election. Instead, it is a way to bolster claims that the election is being stolen, amassing thousands of “examples” that will serve to support an argument that Trump lost by fraud if he is defeated at that ballot box. “This is another cynical and destructive step that Musk and many, many others on the political right are taking to undermine faith in elections, because of their anxiety that if elections are just held in a conventional, straightforward way, their side loses,” he says.

            "content": "The denizens of cryptoland have erupted into celebration and gleeful told-you-so's after Donald Trump, the self-styled “crypto president,” was voted back into the White House on Wednesday morning. Under the Democratic administration led by President Joe Biden, crypto companies have felt they were being singled out for persecution by US financial regulators and denied access to essential services like banking. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, the current vice president, was viewed by the crypto faithful as complicit by proximity and likely to replicate this strategy. (Harris never declared her intentions towards the crypto industry.) But a victory for Trump marks the start of a promising new chapter, they say. “This election was completely existential for crypto in the US,” claims Nic Carter, a general partner at crypto-focused VC firm Castle Island Ventures. “The first [response] is relief. We have been trying to build businesses with one hand tied behind our backs. I can’t emphasize how hard that is.” Under Trump, the industry expects a far friendlier reception from regulators, says Carter, as well as legislation that sets out specific rules for crypto firms. And if Trump incorporates bitcoin into the US government’s balance sheet, advocates speculate it could stoke demand for bitcoin among other world powers, thereby further inflating the price, which rose to record heights after Trump’s victory was confirmed. In short, to them, everything is coming up Milhouse. “Just ceasing the hostilities would have been immensely positive, but we got something better: a candidate that is overtly pro-crypto,” says Carter. “Last night could not have gone any better.” Some of crypto’s largest companies—among them crypto exchange Coinbase and stablecoin issuer Circle—have insisted during the 2024 election cycle that crypto need not become a partisan issue. But crypto figureheads largely lined up behind the Republican candidate: Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, cofounders of crypto platform Gemini, each donated $1 million to Trump, as did Jesse Powell, cofounder of the Kraken exchange. Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, whose VC firm a16z has invested billions of dollars in crypto startups, publicly endorsed Trump for the presidency. “We are on the brink of a new American Renaissance,” wrote Tyler Winklevoss in a post on X, after it became clear that Trump had beaten Harris. On the campaign trail, Trump went out of his way to court their favor. In July, speaking to thousands of bitcoiners at a conference in Nashville, Tennessee, Trump duly sang from the bitcoin hymn sheet, promising to cement the US as the foremost bitcoin mining powerhouse, establish a national “bitcoin stockpile,” and appoint a bitcoin advisory council if reelected. Trump claimed he would turn the US into the “crypto capital of the planet.” In October, Trump went as far as to launch his own crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, which his family has marketed as a way to “make finance great again.” The platform is set to provide peer-to-peer borrowing and lending services of some flavor, though the Trumps have provided few hard details. “If you were a single-issue voter that cares about the growth of sound money through bitcoin, Trump was the clear choice,” says Peter McCormack, host of the podcast What Bitcoin Did. By contrast, Harris’ Democratic platform for 2024 did not include any mention of crypto, and she made only a single reference to crypto on the campaign trail, in a pitch to donors in New York City, Bloomberg reported. \"We will encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting consumers and investors. We will create a safe business environment with consistent and transparent rules of the road,” Harris is quoted as saying. Reticence in the Harris camp to take a public stance on crypto was interpreted by industry members as a signal that her presidency would represent a continuation of the bad old times under Biden. “We saw no evidence that she was going to moderate the stance at all,” says Carter. Democrat-supporting members of the crypto industry were left in an awkward position; though they aligned with Harris’ politics, it was conceivable that victory for Trump would be a more beneficial outcome for the sector. “As a crypto entrepreneur, I’m excited about the prospect of a bull market,” says Jonathan Padilla, one of the organizers of Crypto4Harris, a coalition of left-leaning members of the crypto industry. “For crypto in isolation, Trump is probably going to be the much quicker shot of sugar,” says Padilla, even if the president later loses interest. Although the failure to make a persuasive pitch to the crypto electorate is surely not to blame for Harris losing the presidential race to Trump, concedes Padilla, the crypto industry was able to mobilize its capital to put a finger on the political scale. During the 2024 cycle, crypto firms donated hundreds of millions of dollars to three crypto-friendly super political action committees (PACs)—Fairshake, Protect Progress, and Defend American Jobs—the aim of which was to support crypto-friendly congressional candidates and dislodge the industry’s most vociferous critics. The fruits of that investment became clear on Wednesday. In Ohio, incumbent Democratic senator Sherrod Brown, who is depicted as an arch-villain in crypto circles, was unseated by Republican Bernie Moreno. Through Defend American Jobs, the crypto industry spent more than $40 million in support of Moreno. Meanwhile, according to Stand With Crypto, a nonprofit pushing for bespoke crypto regulation in the US, more than 250 pro-crypto representatives have been elected to Congress. “If there’s one thing that crypto probably will have done very effectively it is influence the House,” says Padilla. With Trump in the Oval Office, the industry expects to benefit from further opportunities to access the corridors of power. Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at Circle, believes that a Trump government will allow his business to advise on policy in the same way it does in the rest of the world. “My hope and expectation is that we would have equal access to an incoming Trump administration,” says Disparte. Though change will inevitably be gradual, crypto has earned a “victory lap,” says Disparte. “I’m very confident that 2025 can be a breakthrough year.” In your inbox: A new series of tips for how to use AI every day Meet the masked vigilante tracking down billions in crypto scams Deep dive: This app set out to fight pesticides.

Many of these leaders, like Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, became figureheads for Trump’s ire over what he believed to be censorship of conservative speech online. Now, as some of the most powerful people in Silicon Valley appear to be quietly sitting out the presidential election cycle, Trump is saying they’ve grown more complimentary of the former president as polls continue to show Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris neck and neck. Influential business leaders are hedging their bets and preparing themselves and their interests just in case Trump wins, according to the Washington Post. Of course, it’s not all just hearsay—Tesla CEO Elon Musk has explicitly thrown his money and support behind the former president in recent weeks. Here’s a running list of the Silicon Valley CEOs Trump says are courting him in the lead-up to the election: On Joe Rogan’s podcast on Friday, Trump claimed that Google CEO Sundar Pichai called to congratulate the former president on his viral McDonald’s stunt. “This McDonald’s thing, I want to tell you, it’s one of the biggest things we’ve seen on Google,” Trump said Pichai told him. Trump repeated the claim again during a Saturday rally in Pennsylvania: “I actually got a call from Sundar, Sundar, who’s great, from Google, he’s a great guy, very smart. The head of Google,” he said. “And he said, ‘Sir, I just want to tell you, what you did with McDonald’s was one of the single biggest events we’ve ever had at Google.’” Trump once again described the alleged call during a Sunday evening rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Pichai has not publicly confirmed if this conversation took place. Google has not responded to requests for comment from WIRED. Earlier this month, Trump said that Cook had called him to complain about a multibillion-dollar fine Apple received from the European Union this year. “[Cook] said something that was interesting,” Trump said. “He said they’re using that to run their enterprise, meaning Europe is their enterprise.” I said, ‘That’s a lot … But Tim, I got to get elected first, but I’m not going to let them take advantage of our companies—that won’t, you know, be happening.’” Trump’s relationship with Apple CEO Tim Cook is one of the most congenial the former president has shared with a Silicon Valley leader. Cook maintained a relationship with Trump during his time in office, often meeting with the president and serving on advisory panels influencing policy decisions that affect Apple’s business, such as tariffs and immigration. Cook has not publicly confirmed that this most recent call took place. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED. Shortly after the assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, this summer, the former president claimed that Zuckerberg called him. In an interview with New York magazine, Trump claimed that Zuckerberg said, “‘I will never vote for people running against you after watching what you did.’” A Meta spokesperson contested what Trump told the magazine, saying, “As Mark has said publicly, he’s not endorsing anybody in this race and has not communicated to anybody how he intends to vote.” (Zuckerberg did not endorse any candidate in the 2016 and 2020 elections and has said that he won’t this cycle either.) While Meta wouldn’t detail the contents of the call, Zuckerberg confirmed he had called Trump after the assassination attempt, calling the former president “bad ass” in July. “Seeing Donald Trump get up after getting shot in the face and pump his fist in the air with the American flag is one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen in my life,” Zuckerberg said. Under Trump, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sustained countless attacks from the Trump administration and conservative lawmakers over censorship allegations. In 2020, Zuckerberg donated $350 million in pandemic support to election departments around the country. Republicans accused these “Zuckerbucks” donations of being unfairly distributed to Democratic districts. In 2021, following the January 6 riot at the Capitol, Trump was banned from Facebook and Instagram. Former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has been under fire in recent days after he decided that the Washington Post would no longer endorse presidential candidates, despite the paper having a Harris endorsement in the works. Trump has long criticized Bezos for his ownership of the Washington Post, but Trump said that Bezos had called him after this summer’s assassination attempt. “It is the most incredible thing I’ve ever watched,” Trump said Bezos told him. “I said, ‘Despite the fact you own the Washington Post, I appreciate it.” Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, reportedly called Trump after the July shooting as well. Much of Bezos’ and Amazon’s business interests rely on government contracts, especially with Amazon Web Services, Amazon’s cloud computing arm, and Blue Origin. Amazon and Blue Origin did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Two years after acquiring Twitter to bring “free speech” back to the platform, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has gone full MAGA. Musk formally endorsed Trump on X after the July assassination attempt, writing, “Last time America had a candidate this tough was Theodore Roosevelt.” Since then, Musk has become one of Trump’s largest donors, spending more than $110 million to bolster the former president’s campaign. The Musk-backed America PAC is aggressively canvassing across battleground states to turn out the vote for Trump. Musk has also joined Trump on the campaign trail, spending the past few weeks stumping for Trump in states like Pennsylvania. Musk has also been using X to support Trump’s campaign, frequently reposting campaign material and links for users to register to vote. X CEO Linda Yaccarino has not endorsed Trump, but has tweeted messages of support after the July shooting and previously served on a Trump administration council promoting public health.

            "content": "As digital scamming explodes in Southeast Asia, including so called “pig butchering” investment scams, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) issued a comprehensive report this week with a dire warning about the rapid growth of this criminal ecosystem. Many digital scams have traditionally relied on social engineering, or tricking victims into giving away their money willingly, rather than leaning on malware or other highly technical methods. But researchers have increasingly sounded the alarm that scammers are incorporating generative AI content and deepfakes to expand the scale and effectiveness of their operations. And the UN report offers the clearest evidence yet that these high tech tools are turning an already urgent situation into a crisis. In addition to buying written scripts to use with potential victims or relying on templates for malicious websites, attackers have increasingly been leaning on generative AI platforms to create communication content in multiple languages and deepfake generators that can create photos or even video of nonexistent people to show victims and enhance verisimilitude. Scammers have also been expanding their use of tools that can drain a victim’s cryptocurrency wallets, have been manipulating transaction records to trick targets into sending cryptocurrency to the wrong places, and are compromising smart contracts to steal cryptocurrency. And in some cases, they’ve been purchasing Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite internet systems to help power their efforts. “Agile criminal networks are integrating these new technologies faster than anticipated, driven by new online marketplaces and service providers which have supercharged the illicit service economy,” John Wojcik, a UNODC regional analyst, tells WIRED. “These developments have not only expanded the scope and efficiency of cyber-enabled fraud and cybercrime, but they have also lowered the barriers to entry for criminal networks that previously lacked the technical skills to exploit more sophisticated and profitable methods.” For years, China-linked criminals have trafficked people into gigantic compounds in Southeast Asia, where they are often forced to run scams, held against their will, and beaten if they refuse instructions. Around 200,000 people, from at least 60 countries, have been trafficked to compounds largely in Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos over the last five years. However, as WIRED reporting has shown, these operations are spreading globally—with scamming infrastructure emerging in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and West Africa. Most prominently, these organized crime operations have run pig butchering scams, where they build intimate relationships with victims before introducing an “investment opportunity” and asking for money. Criminal organizations may have conned people out of around $75 billion through pig butchering scams. Aside from pig butchering, according to the UN report, criminals across Southeast Asia are also running job scams, law enforcement impersonation, asset recovery scams, virtual kidnappings, sextortion, loan scams, business email compromise, and other illicit schemes. Criminal networks in the region earned up to $37 billion last year, UN officials estimate. Perhaps unsurprisingly, all of this revenue is allowing scammers to expand their operations and diversify, incorporating new infrastructure and technology into their systems in the hope of making them more efficient and brutally effective. For example, scammers are often constrained by their language skills and ability to keep up conversations with potentially hundreds of victims at a time in numerous languages and dialects. However, generative AI developments within the last two years—including the launch of writing tools such as ChatGPT—are making it easier for criminals to break down language barriers and create the content needed for scamming. The UN’s report says AI can be used for automating phishing attacks that ensnare victims, the creation of fake identities and online profiles, and the crafting of personalized scripts to trick victims while messaging them in different languages. “These developments have not only expanded the scope and efficiency of cyber-enabled fraud and cybercrime, but they have also lowered the barriers to entry for criminal networks that previously lacked the technical skills to exploit sophisticated and profitable methods,” the report says. Stephanie Baroud, a criminal intelligence analyst in Interpol’s human trafficking unit, says the impact of AI needs to be considered as part of a pig butchering scammer’s tactics going forward. Baroud, who spoke with WIRED in an interview before the publication of the UN report, says the criminal’s recruitment ads that lure people into being trafficked to scamming compounds used to be “very generic” and full of grammatical errors. However, AI is now making them appear more polished and compelling, Baroud says. “It is really making it easier to create a very realistic job offer,” she says. “Unfortunately, this will make it much more difficult to identify which is the real and which is the fake ads.” Perhaps the biggest AI paradigm shift in such digital attacks comes from deepfakes. Scammers are increasingly using machine-learning systems to allow for real-time face-swapping. This technology, which has also been used by romance scammers in West Africa, allows criminals to change their appearance on calls with their victims, making them realistically appear to be a different person. The technology is allowing “one-click” face swaps and high-resolution video feeds, the UN’s report states. Such services are a game changer for scammers, because they allow attackers to “prove” to victims in photos or real-time video calls that they are who they claim to be. Using these setups, however, can require stable internet connections, which can be harder to maintain within some regions where pig butchering compounds and other scamming have flourished. There has been a “notable” increase in cops seizing Starlink satellite dishes in recent months in Southeast Asia, the UN says—80 units were seized between April and June this year. In one such operation carried out in June, Thai police confiscated 58 Starlink devices. In another instance, law enforcement seized 10 Starlink devices and 4,998 preregistered SIM cards while criminals were in the process of moving their operations from Myanmar to Laos. Starlink did not immediately respond to WIRED’s request for comment. “Obviously using real people has been working for them very well, but using the tech could be cheaper after they have the required computers” and connectivity, says Troy Gochenour, a volunteer with the Global Anti-Scam Organization (GASO), a US-based nonprofit that fights human-trafficking and cybercrime operations in Southeast Asia. Gochenour’s research involves tracking trends on Chinese-language Telegram channels related to carrying out pig butchering scams. And he says that it is increasingly common to see people applying to be AI models for scam content. In addition to AI services, attackers have increasingly leaned on other technical solutions as well. One tool that has been increasingly common in digital scamming is so-called “crypto drainers,” a type of malware that has particularly been deployed against victims in Southeast Asia. Drainers can be more or less technically sophisticated, but their common goal is to “drain” funds from a target’s cryptocurrency wallets and redirect the currency to wallets controlled by attackers. Rather than stealing the credentials to access the target wallet directly, drainers are typically designed to look like a legitimate service—either by impersonating an actual platform or creating a plausible brand. Once a victim has been tricked into connecting their wallet to the drainer, they are then manipulated into approving one or a few transactions that grant attackers unintended access to all the funds in the wallet. Drainers can be used in many contexts and with many fronts. They can be a component of pig butchering investment scams, or promoted to potential victims through compromised social media accounts, phishing campaigns, and malvertizing. Researchers from the firm ScamSniffer, for example, published findings in December about sponsored social media and search engine ads linked to malicious websites that contained a cryptocurrency drainer. The campaign, which ran from March to December 2023 reportedly stole about $59 million from more than 63,000 victims around the world. Far from the low-tech days of doing everything through social engineering by building a rapport with potential victims and crafting tricky emails and text messages, today’s scammers are taking a hybrid approach to make their operations as efficient and lucrative as possible, UN researchers say. And even if they aren’t developing sophisticated malware themselves in most cases, scammers are increasingly in the market to use these malicious tools, prompting malware authors to adapt or create hacking tools for scams like pig butchering. Researchers say that scammers have been seen using infostealers and even remote access trojans that essentially create a backdoor in a victim’s system that can be utilized in other types of attacks. And scammers are also expanding their use of malicious smart contracts that appear to programmatically establish a certain agreed-upon transaction or set of transactions, but actually does much more. “Infostealer logs and underground data markets have also been critical to ongoing market expansion, with access to unprecedented amounts of sensitive data serving as a major catalyst,” Wojcik, from the UNODC, says. The changing tactics are significant as global law enforcement scrambles to deter digital scamming. But they are just one piece of the larger picture, which is increasingly urgent and bleak for forced laborers and victims of these crimes. “It is now increasingly clear that a potentially irreversible displacement and spillover has taken place in which organized crime are able to pick, choose, and move value and jurisdictions as needed, with the resulting situation rapidly outpacing the capacity of governments to contain it,” UN officials wrote in the report. “Failure to address this ecosystem will have consequences for Southeast Asia and other regions.” In your inbox: Upgrade your life with WIRED-tested gear A bitcoin mining dream turned into a nightmare The Big Interview: Marissa Mayer—I am a software girl I made a wholesome OnlyFans to try to make ends meet Event: Join us for The Big Interview on December 3 in San Francisco More From WIRED Reviews and Guides © 2024 Condé Nast.

A rudimentary pouch or cube with a single zippered compartment—or, perhaps more primitively, a Ziploc bag—with just enough space to hold travel shampoo and conditioner, a toothbrush, maybe a razor. But the items probably roll around and spill, or squish out of hastily screwed-on lids. Next thing you know, you’re rummaging through what's basically a junk drawer any time you need to find something. There is a better way. As someone who lives far from family, I have been traveling every few months for the past 18 years and have tried all genres of toiletry bag—from Dopp kits and cosmetic bags to hanging models so big they take up half of a carry-on suitcase. As any longtime traveler knows, toiletry bags are subjective. Some people like to travel as light as possible with just a razor and some shampoo. Others have elaborate skin- and hair-care routines that practically require a tackle box. There are clear bags, bags with many compartments or elastic organizers, and even bags made out of sailcloth. The only firm principle is that a “good” toiletry bag should make your life easier, not more difficult. To help parse the overwhelming array of options on the market, I've included some of our Gear team members' favorite toiletry bags they've been using for years, plus some new selections from brands whose other bags we loved and those whose designs or features provided something unique to the category.

How We Tested For bags our team hadn’t already been using for years, I spent four weeks rotating new toiletry bags during my morning routine. I noted any annoyances or unique details, volume, how easy it was to store and retrieve items, how much space each one took up on the vanity, how they survived being splashed with water and soap, and, if the bag could hang, how easy it was to retrieve items once hanging. During the testing period, my family happened to go on two weekend trips that required stays in hotels. We took different groups of bags and determined how easy it was to use multiple bags at once in a small space, if their hook designs allowed for multiple places to hang, and whether the contents spilled in or otherwise dirtied the bags, and if so, how easy they were to clean. The Gear team will continue to use the bags and update this guide with longevity and other new observations. What Kind of Toiletry Bag Do I Need? Dopp kits, cosmetics cases, hanging bags … the differences between categories isn’t always clear. Here are some of the more common types of toiletry bags you'll come across, and what to consider with each. Dopp kit: Named for leather craftsman Charles Doppelt, who provided “Dopps,” or toiletry kits, for WWII soldiers. “Dopp kit” has evolved over time to indicate any kind of portable toiletry organizer, but commercially, toiletry bags labeled “Dopp kits” tend to be smaller and hold just a handful of necessities for short trips as opposed to larger fold-up hanging bags and cosmetics cases. Cosmetics case: Designed for those who need more than just the necessities, a cosmetics case is usually a much larger boxlike container with specialized compartments for makeup, skin care, hair care, and other necessities. They often come with extras like brush holders and mirrors. Hanging toiletry bag: A bag that, as the name indicates, comes with a hook so that it can be hung on a hook, towel rack, tree, or someplace it won’t take up space on the counter. Often, the user needs to hang them to be able to access all the storage compartments. Something to consider is that hooks can be used up quite quickly if everyone in your hotel room has a hanging bag. All the hooks in our bathroom were taken almost immediately, so my husband ended up having to hang his bag over the toilet, which he wasn’t thrilled about. A good hanging toiletry bag will also have a hook that's thin enough to slip over just about any hook, and be rubber tipped so it won't slide off. The maker of our favorite carry-on suitcase, Away, has done it again with this sleek, well-made, unisex toiletry bag that holds an impressive amount of items—especially for its modest 10.2 x 3.7-inch countertop footprint. I tested the large (3.6 liter) size; it also comes in a small (2.3 liter) size, and I was able to fit three full-size bottles of hair product in addition to a hand mirror, all my makeup, and various travel-size items in its sturdy, pouchlike confines. My items felt both secure and immediately accessible. The bag is also long enough to fit that ubiquitous awkward plastic toothbrush pouch so many of us get from the dentist. There's a central zip compartment, a clear zip pocket lined with PVC, and an easy-access zippered pocket on the back. For those who like to match, many of the available colors mirror Away's hard-sided luggage. (If that's not enough customization, you can also pay an extra $20 to have the exterior of the toiletry bag embroidered with your initials.) The only thing I didn't like is that the matte nylon exterior, while water-resistant, does tend to pick up stains quickly. An impressive value, this no-nonsense bag is packed with enough organizational features to satisfy a wide array of travelers. I tested the medium size, which should be plenty large for most people with its six zippered pouches—two lined with easy-clean PVC and one with mesh—plus a handy detachable shower caddy and mirror. Three mesh non-zippered pouches in the main compartment are large enough to fit smaller full-size tubes of product, and the thin, rubber-tipped hook makes it easy to hang just about anywhere without slipping off. It's also got a fabric handle on the top for carrying. It comes in a slew of colors, fabrics, and prints, although it's on the heavier side at 14 ounces and has a large 11.5 x 9.75-inch footprint if you're unable to hang it. L.L. Bean says its abrasion-resistant nylon packcloth exterior keeps spills contained, and though I found this to be true in the short term after “spilling” half of a travel-size container of liquid inside, the liquid was able to leak out of the zipper and, after half a day, the fabric became damp. L.L. Bean's water-resistance claims aside, my whole family loved the versatility of this bag. I’ve had the Beis Dopp Kit for four years now, and it’s still my go-to for any trip. The poly canvas material is durable and easy to spot-clean. Plus, I opted for the black version to mask the inevitable scuffs and smaller stains. What I love the most, though, are the compartments. The water-resistant section is a total game changer when packing liquids or fragrances. If something leaks, a quick wipe gets the job done. The waterproof bottom is also a huge bonus when I’m getting ready at a bathroom sink. The wire-frame top section stays open while I’m packing or digging around for something. Inside, there’s a zippered pocket where I store my toothbrush and toothpaste, and a separate compartment for smaller essentials like my contact lens case. I’ll admit it’s a little bulky, so if you’re tight on space, it might not be the best fit. I usually check mine in, since it holds my full-size products, but if I’m packing light, it also works for TSA-friendly items in a carry-on. —Boutayna Chokrane Wandrd's Toiletry Bag comes in two sizes: medium and large. Get the large, because it has more storage and organization and doesn't cost much more. The medium, which is also available on Amazon, is a little too simple for the asking price (though if you buy both, you can merge them together). It's made from Robic nylon with a thermoplastic urethane coating, and it's weather-proof (not submersible), thanks to the zippers and coating. That should help keep liquid in if your perfume bottle breaks when baggage handlers are a little too carefree with your luggage. There are webbing loops on the exterior, and this lets you connect it to other bags, like Wandrd's Prvke (my favorite camera bag), or you can buy the carry strap ($24) and wear it as a crossbody. Do you want to carry your toiletry bag as a crossbody? Well, maybe! I've stayed at hostels where I've carried all my stuff to the shared shower area, and a strap would've helped dangle it off a doorknob so I didn't have to plop it on the wet ground. On the back of the large size, there are three little pockets for ChapStick and the like, and the middle one has a built-in carabiner. Open up the main compartment and it's spacious, with a zippered pocket on one side and a little spot to attach your toothbrush. The best feature of this bag is the toothbrush protection sleeve, which keeps it so your toothbrush bristles don't touch anything else in the bag. This main compartment could stand to have a little more organization, but I mostly used it to store my hair brush. Lastly, on the outside is another zippered pocket, and this is where you get two mesh pouches and a final zippered pocket. My main gripe is that everything is a dull black, and I wouldn't have minded some color options or at least a brighter interior for easier visibility when grabbing things out of the bag in the dark. —Julian Chokkattu Does the average traveler need a toiletry bag made partially of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), which is 15 times stronger than steel by weight? Perhaps not, but it definitely makes for an interesting bag. Part of Aer’s newly released 10th Anniversary Ultra Collection, this hardy, chunky little Dopp kit incorporates the collection's Ultra400X fabric (in black only) by Challenge Sailcloth, known for its high-performance sails for yacht racers and kite surfers. It's a visibly durable material, slightly shiny with a crinkly look that is certainly unique, if not evocative of a regular bag that accidentally went through the wash. Despite its strength, the Travel Kit is still pretty lightweight at 8 ounces, and I like that it can either sit on the counter with a 9 x 6.5-inch footprint or hang by a hook that tucks neatly away (though the hook is thick plastic and too small for a towel rack). There are zipped pouches on the front and back, with multiple pouches (one lined with neon-green fabric for high visibility in a dark room or suitcase) and a dual-compartment elastic organizer on the inside. Another downside, though it is admittedly a small one, is that the rubbery “Aer” brand tags on the outside and inside seem to accumulate toothbrush and soap residue, as does the mesh zippered pouch in the top compartment, and both proved somewhat difficult to clean. Reviewers Nena Farrell and Boutayna Chokrane both love Béis for its thoughtful design details (see above and here, and also here), and the company's cosmetics case is no exception. It’s a seemingly simple design: a 10 x 7-inch polyurethane rectangle with a handle that opens from the top like a lunchbox—perfect for events like weddings and other public appearances where you need something of an auxiliary makeup station instead of just storage. However, unique features like an easy-to-clean makeup brush holder that pops in and out via a magnet and a large removable mirror make this the most pleasant-to-use cosmetic case I tested. I also appreciate that it comes in seven neutral colors and is easy to clean, with all interior surfaces featuring what Beis calls a “wipeable top coating.” Downsides include bulkiness, being on the heavier side at just under 1 pound by itself, and the paucity of small compartments to separate breakable items or easily damaged makeup like eyeshadow. Known for its ultralight camping and backpacking gear, Sea to Summit makes some of our favorite sleeping bags and tents, so it’s no wonder we also love its light-as-air hanging toiletry bag, made out of water-resistant 30D Ultra-Sil Cordura nylon (color options include blue, orange, and gray). I tested the large version, which features two zippered mesh pouches and a small shatterproof mirror that slides in and out. Travelers can hang the bag on a tree or towel rack, or lay its 11-by-9.5-inch body on a rock or bathroom vanity, though I admit I found it floppy and cumbersome to use when not hanging. For those not taking it outdoors, its lightweight, unstructured body is easily mashable in a suitcase, which is great for packing but not so great for breakable or fragile items like glass containers. The one main compartment is also extremely roomy, so items have a tendency to roll around. For backpackers and travelers concerned with weight, the large version is impressively light at only 4 ounces, including the mirror—the lightest of any bag we tested. Backpackers and those looking for even less weight might do well with the 2.8-ounce small size. Sea to Summit also offers a lifetime guarantee. The erstwhile must-have accessory of both early-aughts Southern sorority girls and their grandmothers, Vera Bradley bags are back with a new spokesperson (Zooey Deschanel), new designs, and updated fabrics like smooth twill and cotton gabardine. (Die-hard fans can rest assured the staple quilted paisley options are still available.) The new line includes multiple styles of toiletry bags that are lightweight, giftable, and can add a pop of color and personality to your travel setup. I tested several, and my favorite was the Lay-Flat Travel Organizer—its two interior clear zippered compartments and three mesh slip pockets were roomy yet snug enough to keep all contents of my morning routine secure, and a rather large spill of soap in the large pocket cleaned up quickly. However, even though the fabric is padded, which provides some protection for the interior contents, the exterior is somewhat absorbent and not machine washable (though other designs are), so be forewarned that light-colored options could attract stains. Cotopaxi’s trim little bag is meant not just for hygiene items, but any collection of odds and ends. It’s made from light recycled deadstock nylon (so, probably not for you if you are carrying glass bottles or anything that needs padding) and weighs in at a modest 6.5 ounces. Your colorway will probably be unique! I like the surprisingly capacious 4-liter capacity spread over three different compartments, with a big middle compartment for your quart bag of liquids and two other compartments with separate, smaller pockets for travel toiletries like floss, lip balm, or a toothbrush. It also has a loop to hang it in the bathroom, so technically it's a hanging toiletry bag. I do have to admit though, that I like hooks better, and hanging is more convenient with a clamshell toiletry bag design. —Adrienne So There were multiple great bags we tried whose features or designs just didn't add up to a place in the top spots above. However, everyone has something different they're looking for in a toiletry bag, so while not perfect for us, some of these options may still be perfect for you. State Bags Benson Toiletry Kit for $68: This is a solid, simple bag with three mesh pouches and a snap-in/snap-out plastic envelope that could theoretically hold something messy like a toothbrush or bar of soap. The navy version I tested had a coated polyester wipe-clean exterior and interior made from recycled bottles, and I liked that it had the option to hang. However, the organization was more rudimentary than similar-category bags we tested, and it was missing some of the thoughtful details featured on other bags in the same price range, like a quick-access pouch on the back and a larger hook with a rubber tip to prevent slipping. (This bag's thick, small plastic hook wasn't even wide enough to hang on a towel rack.) July Hanging Toiletry Bag for $85: I own and love July's carry-on suitcase, so I was excited to try the brand's popular hanging toiletry bag. It's a great design with a zippered pouch on the back, plus a body that zips flat to reveal PVC and pouch zip compartments and a large, rubber-tipped metal hook that tucks away. It looks well-made and stylish with leather trim and gunmetal hardware, but my husband took it on a business trip and found that its pockets are actually quite small, confirming a worry I had when I tested it in my bathroom at home. It wouldn't be an issue if the bag itself were small, but it took up a full quarter of the carry-on. Fjallraven Kanken Toiletry Bag for $55: I love this thing, which makes me feel like a Red Cross nurse on the battlefields of World War II. It’s made from a proprietary Fjallraven fabric blend that combines organic cotton with recycled polyester, so it feels like fabric but is more waterproof and durable. It has a clamshell design with a sturdy interior plastic hook. My quart bag of bottles goes into the enormous lower zip compartment, my toothbrush and deodorant in the top compartment, and there’s mesh pockets and MOLLE webbing so that your tiny things are easily visible. However, its dimensions are very large, so this might not be for you if you’re a minimalist with just a toothbrush and a comb. —Adrienne So Calpak Clear Cosmetics Case for $85: Constructed largely of water-resistant, wipe-clean PVC, this clear cosmetic case (I tested the medium size) zips all the way around and folds flat to reveal two zippered compartments and one smaller zippered mesh bag. It also looks like a cute little purse with its 16 trendy color options, dual handles, and metal bottom studs. However, contents aren't as easy to access as other cosmetic cases that just open from the top—you have to lay the Calpak flat to open both sides, which requires a 16-by-10-inch footprint, and the all-clear construction isn't very discreet.

            "content": "Steve Bannon got out of federal prison at around 3 am Tuesday. Seven hours later, he was live on his War Room podcast to “flood the zone with shit” exactly one week before the presidential election. Flooding the zone with shit is Bannon’s own oft-quoted description of his media strategy: churning so many lies or half-truths into the stratosphere that it becomes impossible to draw a line between fact and fiction. “I am more energized and more focused than I’ve ever been in my entire life,” said Bannon on the War Room stream on Rumble, which garnered nearly 100,000 live viewers at one point. “The four months in federal prison not only didn’t break me, it empowered me.” Bannon, 70, a longtime ally of and former strategist for Donald Trump, spent four months at a low-security federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, for contempt after he defied a subpoena in the congressional probe into the January 6 Capitol riot. Bannon has cast himself as a martyr—someone who, like January 6 rioters and like Trump, is being unfairly persecuted by the same tyrannical forces they’re up against next week in the election. On Tuesday on air, and later at a press conference, Bannon repeatedly suggested that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi banished him to prison because she wanted to contain his influence. “If you’re not prepared to be sent to federal prison as a political prisoner, then you’re not worthy to be in this movement,” he said. “You have to understand, they want to put you in prison, and they will put you in prison. If you can’t accept that, then you don’t know what they represent.” Bannon’s return to the public sphere also means the return of a massive mouthpiece to amplify the election fraud conspiracies that are already raging online. And Bannon got directly to business, spinning a tale to his viewers of Democrats plotting to heist the 2024 election. “Every day after November 5 is going to be Stalingrad,” Bannon said. “If they can’t take it away from Trump, if they can’t nullify it right there, they want to at least delegitimize his victory.” “They will go to any length to stop President Trump,” Bannon continued. “That’s the reality.” A 2023 Brookings study on disinformation in political podcasts identified Bannon’s War Room as the biggest disseminator of falsehoods and unsubstantiated claims; about a fifth of all episodes assessed by researchers were determined to have claims flagged as false by debunkers such as Snopes and Politifact. “If the Pelosi apparatus wins, you better be prepared to go to federal prison,” Bannon said. “Because these people have no qualms about weaponizing the justice system, weaponizing the legal system, against Americans who have different political views.” His fans seem to be happy he’s back. “God Bless You Steve' Get The Bannon Sledge Hammer Out, And Start Smashing The TRAITORS,” one viewer wrote during the Tuesday livestream. “Welcome back Steve, we need our leader,” wrote another. “Give us our marching orders and lets get this done.” In your inbox: Our biggest stories, handpicked for you each day Election reaction: The manosphere won The Big Story: California will keep moving the world forward Trump's failed attempt to overthrow Venezuela's president Event: Join us for The Big Interview on December 3 in San Francisco More From WIRED Reviews and Guides © 2024 Condé Nast.

            "content": "Elon Musk’s America PAC and several other defendants, including the reelection campaign for Representative Michelle Steel, a Republican from California, are accused of violating California labor law in a class action filed in Orange County on October 30, according to court documents obtained by WIRED. The named plaintiffs, Tamiko Anderson and Patricia Kelly, were canvassers for Steel in October of this year, according to the suit, which alleges that they weren’t paid agreed-upon wages. America PAC is named because it provided campaigning services for Steel. The plaintiffs are also suing over an alleged failure to reimburse business expenses and for allegedly being provided inaccurate wage statements. The suit seeks class certification for “All current and former non-exempt employees of Defendants in the State of California who were employed as canvassers and canvassed for Michelle Steel at any time from October 30, 2023, through the present.” “The Steel campaign has no knowledge of these individuals, they did not and do not work for the Steel campaign, and the campaign will not comment on individuals that involve a Super PAC with which we have no involvement,” a spokesperson for the Steel campaign said in a statement. These allegations are different from those WIRED reported earlier this week, when canvassers in Michigan said they were tricked and threatened as part of Elon Musk and America PAC’s get-out-the-vote effort for Donald Trump. The door knockers, who worked for a subcontractor of America PAC, were flown to Michigan, driven in the back of a U-Haul, and told they would have to pay hotel bills unless they met unrealistic quotas. One was surprised to find, upon arrival in Michigan, that they were working to elect Donald Trump.  The Blair Group, a North Carolina firm that the complaint claims is a political consultancy, and Liberty Staffing Services, a Florida firm specializing in hiring and payroll for canvassers and other W2 employees of political campaigns, are the other named defendants. Neither immediately responded to requests for comment. The suit also lists unknown Johns Doe as defendants. The plaintiffs are owed money, according to the suit. “As with other members of the Class, Plaintiffs were guaranteed an agreed upon wage hourly wage [sic] upon starting their employment. However, Plaintiffs are informed and believe that Defendants failed to pay them at the correct hourly wage, and, instead, paid them based on the number of residences they canvassed. To date, Plaintiffs have yet to receive the underpaid wages owed to them,” the complaint states. The defendants in the lawsuit also were not reimbursed for downloading various apps on their personal devices, according to the complaint. The plaintiffs also allege their cell phones were used to track time worked, but that they still were not compensated for those hours. America PAC, into which Musk has poured more than $100 million, has largely taken up get-out-the-vote operations in key swing states for the Donald Trump campaign. Widespread reports depict its operations as a mess, though—in addition to WIRED’s reporting on its efforts in Michigan, The Guardian has reported that up to 25 percent of its door knocks may be fraudulent, and NBC has reported that campaign operatives have concerns about “suspect data.” In an election all polls show as a toss-up, a shambolic field operation could well mean the difference between victory and defeat. Neither Alex Spiro, Musk’s attorney, nor a spokesperson for X, which Musk owns, immediately replied to requests for comment and requests to be put in touch with a representative of America PAC, which does not list contact information on its website. A representative for The Blair Group also did not return a request for comment. Updated 11/1/2024, 7:50 pm EST to add a statement from the Steel campaign and clarify for whom the suit seeks class certification.

            "content": "On a dead-end road that climbs out of the tiny city of Jenkins, in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in Eastern Kentucky, there stands a large warehouse with a mint green roof. It shares the road with a few other businesses, but is otherwise surrounded by an expanse of open fields and tree-lined slopes. Inside, the warehouse is stacked high with racks on racks of computers—thousands of them. But none have ever been switched on. The warehouse is owned by Mohawk Energy, a company cofounded by Kentucky state senator Brandon Smith in 2005, originally to resculpt landscapes disfigured by coal mining. After lying dormant for a period, Mohawk was reincarnated in 2022 when Smith struck a deal with HBTPower, a company then owned by Chinese crypto exchange Huobi, which wanted to use the warehouse for a bitcoin mining operation. Under the deal, Mohawk promised to fit up its warehouse with the necessary power infrastructure and repair any equipment that went down. In return, HBT would pay Mohawk a monthly hosting fee, a cut of its mining revenue, and the associated energy bills. Smith says he hoped the arrangement would generate tax revenue and create jobs for former coal miners, who could be trained as repair technicians. The coal industry departed Jenkins long ago, the reserves depleted, leaving people in search of work. More than a third now live below the poverty line, per the latest census data. “I liked the idea of going from one type of mining to a new type,” says Smith. “I thought, now in Eastern Kentucky we are going to have our time—we’re going to catch up and play a part in the tech future.” But after a promising start, the relationship between Mohawk and HBT soured and then fell apart. “Nothing has ever been turned on. It’s a fascinating, almost Willy Wonka–type atmosphere when you walk through,” says Smith. “It has turned into a disaster.” In November 2023, HBT brought a lawsuit in federal court, alleging that Mohawk had breached its contract on several fronts, including by failing to install the appropriate power infrastructure and secure certain power subsidies, and attempting to sell off the mining equipment. “Ultimately, the source of the current dispute is Mohawk’s basic failure to comply with its obligations, not only in a timely way, but at all in many regards,” says Harout Samra, a specialist in international dispute resolution at law firm DLA Piper and representative for HBT. Mohawk sued HBT in return, contesting the various alleged breaches and claiming that HBT is delinquent on more than $700,000 in rent, labor, and fit-up costs. The company is also seeking damages relating to the loss of income over the term of the contract and the inability to bring a new tenant into the facility while the equipment remains on-site. “Huobi simply made a bargain it believes now is a bad one, and wants to get out of it without paying the funds it owes,” the filing states. The legal conflict, which remains unresolved, is just one in a series of fights between Chinese companies and the owners of industrial facilities in the rural US over failed bitcoin mining partnerships. What looked to facility owners in Kentucky like an irresistible opportunity to tap into a new line of business in an otherwise fallow period has turned into a nightmare. They claim to have been saddled with unpaid hosting fees and energy bills worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, with few options for recovering the money. The Chinese parties have been left equally displeased. “HBTPower obviously regrets that this opportunity has ultimately played out the way it has,” says Samra. The bitcoin mining game—a race between computers to win the right to process a bundle of transactions and claim a crypto reward—is dominated by large corporations that own and operate industrial-scale facilities. But in 2021 and 2022, smaller-scale operations began to proliferate in the US countryside wherever there was available power, including in Kentucky. “A lot of mom-and-pop shops opened up,” says Phil Harvey, CEO at Sabre56, a firm that consults on crypto mining projects and operates its own facilities. “Appalachia has always been a good source of power.” These small facilities were plugging a gap in the market. A ban on crypto mining in China had left businesses casting about for a new home for their many millions of dollars’ worth of mining equipment. “A lot of wealthy Chinese businesses were affected,” says Harvey. “Every minute these machines are down, they are losing revenue.” Meanwhile, as the price of bitcoin ballooned—and the profitability of mining along with it—mining firms and investor groups began to hoard large quantities of bitcoin mining equipment of their own, says Harvey, without considering where they might deploy it. In an overheated market, holders of mining equipment jumped into hosting arrangements at short notice with owners of small facilities, some of whom had no prior experience and insufficient expertise, who agreed to install the equipment and run the mining operations on their behalf. But the haste with which these hosting relationships came together, in the name of striking while bitcoin was hot, says Harvey, set many of the partnerships up for failure. There was limited due diligence conducted by parties on both sides, delays in kitting out facilities and deploying equipment, and disputes over payment terms, he says, among other points of friction. “It's a snowball effect where everyone just ends up getting pissed off with each other,” says Harvey. Though the American market proved more expensive and bureaucratic than some Chinese businesses expected, says Harvey, problems were also caused by the hubris of facility owners, some of whom found themselves in over their heads. “It’s no joke running a [bitcoin mining] operation of any kind of scale,” he says. “Just because the Chinese are tough to do business with, doesn’t mean they are the ones in the wrong. I would say that blame is equally shared.” The law firm acting for Mohawk in its dispute with HBT, Anna Whites Law Office, has represented multiple owners of small facilities in Kentucky in similar legal conflicts with Chinese partners. The cases differ from the Mohawk situation, says attorney Anna Whites, founder of the firm, but share a common thread: “We saw a pattern that [companies with ties to China] would ship in machines with uncertain provenance, mine very heavily for three months, then run without paying the bill,” she claims. Some of the cases settled out of court; Whites is unable to supply the details for reasons of client confidentiality. But others continue to drag on. Biofuel Mining, a company formerly co-owned by Smith, is involved in legal tangles with two companies that Whites believes to be run out of China: Touzi Tech and VCV Power Gamma. Although both are incorporated in Delaware, per SEC filings, they conduct business in Mandarin and cannot be reached at their listed US addresses, Whites claims. “It's pretty standard for the foreign entities from any country to get a short-term office so that they have less scrutiny from US investors and government agencies,” she says. In both cases, Biofuel claims, the firms shipped equipment from China to its hosting facility in Eastern Kentucky, then walked away with the bitcoin produced, leaving behind hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid energy bills and hosting fees. Biofuel reached a settlement with Touzi in early 2022 for $60,000, but despite having handed back the mining equipment, it claims not to have received the sum it is owed under the agreement. In the still-unresolved spat with VCV, Biofuel received permission from the Martin County Circuit Court in Kentucky to sell off the mining equipment, claims Whites, to recoup a portion of the funds it is owed (she has not confirmed the amount), but she alleges that no damages have yet been awarded. VCV has stopped responding to communications, she claims. Biofuel has since dissolved, put out of business by the failed hosting ventures. “I literally lost my house—I lost everything. It financially ruined me,” says Wes Hamilton, former Biofuel Mining CEO. “I’m just so frustrated about the whole thing.” WIRED contacted VCV and Touzi for comment, but did not receive any response. There are few financial recovery options for companies like Mohawk and Biofuel. The situation is made more difficult, as in the Mohawk case, if they are dealing with so-called special purpose entities. Because they are set up by their parent companies for a single specific business venture, these entities need not be concerned about their long-term ability to operate in the US. “It certainly can be more difficult to recover damages from a non-US counterparty,” says Kim Havlin, a partner in the global commercial litigation practice at law firm White & Case. “There is certainly a risk that an entity that doesn’t need to be in the US may just ignore the case.” Even if the Kentucky facility owners win out in court, it could be difficult to collect any damages awarded. “A judgment is essentially a piece of paper. Any judgment needs to be turned into assets or cash in order to be valuable,” says Havlin. If the opposing party refuses to pay up and has no US assets to collect against, sometimes that isn’t possible. Almost a year after the dispute began, the Mohawk case is stuck in legal limbo. In a setback for Mohawk, the presiding judge recently denied its motion to dismiss HBT’s complaint, on the basis that it had failed to sufficiently back up its argument. The judge also pushed Mohawk’s countersuit into arbitration, a forum for resolving disputes privately instead of in open court. Non-US parties tend to prefer arbitration as a way to “remove a home forum from both sides,” explains Havlin. “You can pick an arbitral seat in neither country as a means of creating a neutral playing field.” A parallel federal court hearing is set for December to consider whether an injunction should be imposed on Mohawk, preventing it from selling off the remaining HBT equipment in its possession. Smith has given up on the idea of recovering the full amount he claims to be owed. “We’re at the point that it’s almost silly to even be arguing about breaking even,” he says. In an interview with PBS that aired in September 2023, touting the Mohawk Energy facility, Smith said he hoped to prove that not every business that blew into Jenkins would abandon the area. “I’ve stood at their ribbon cuttings, then watched them leave. I’d like to do something to let people know that not everybody is like that,” he said. After the relationship with HBT collapsed last year, Smith faces the prospect of Mohawk becoming yet another false start. With the facility inactive, the company has been forced to dismiss the former coal miners brought on as technicians. (It is unclear how many people it employed.) The Mohawk facility was perhaps never set to revitalize Jenkins in the way Smith hoped, anyway. “I would say that a rural community benefits very little from a bitcoin mining facility. In terms of job creation, it’s minimal in a lot of cases,” says Harvey, the consultant. “It's certainly not the savior to a dwindling community.” Nonetheless, Smith remains hopeful of salvaging the crypto mining project, with a new partner. “I’m hoping that this gets settled in the way that it should and that somebody comes forward and lets us go through with the vision that we wanted for this region,” he says. “I hope every day that maybe some big company will see that there's a place ready to go in this part of the country.” Otherwise, Mohawk’s dalliance with bitcoin mining will become a cautionary tale. “It was very hurtful to see these families lose their income. We were one of the biggest payrolls in Jenkins,” says Smith. “It adds insult to injury that I’m sitting here arguing in court.” Correction: 10/23/2024 11 AM EDT: The piece has been updated to clarify Mohawk's day to day responsibilities with regards to equipment maintenance.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED Earlier this month I complimented a friend on her new Bottega Jodie bag. She had recently got a promotion at work, and is now a senior manager at a respectable record label earning six figures. The bag was a celebratory gift, she told me, only it wasn’t Bottega—it was a dupe. As someone who has a closet full of designer labels—and who could certainly afford to buy the real thing—her admission surprised me. My face must have given that away. “It’s real Italian leather,” she quickly followed up, “and their website says they manufacture in the same factories as some luxury brands. You couldn’t tell the difference, so why would I spend thousands more for basically the same thing?” It’s a question many have been asking since dupe culture went supernova over the last few years. A shorthand for duplicate, dupes are cheaper alternatives that are basically the same as the real thing. Think of it as a cousin to counterfeit culture, but instead of being a cheap knock-off that infringes on a brand’s trademark, they’re uncannily similar imitations—promising the same qualities of the product at a fraction of the cost. It’s not just my friend who loves them either. Roughly one-third of all US adults have intentionally bought a dupe, according to Morning Consult, with that figure rising to almost half for Gen Z shoppers and 44% for millennials. In the UK, research by Mintel shows 47% of consumers are now open to buying luxury lookalikes in 2024, compared to just 12% in 2016. “The shame of buying these things has gone,” says Alice Sherwood, author of Authenticity: Reclaiming Reality in a Counterfeit Culture. “Luxury prices have skyrocketed while the trend cycle has rapidly accelerated. People no longer want to spend upwards of £4000 on the latest ‘It’ bag that might be out of vogue within a year.” Add their proliferation on social media into that mix, and the dupe culture has been normalised in ways that “knock-offs” from Canal Street never were, she says. Just one scroll on TikTok would affirm this. At the time of writing over 260,000 posts have been made under the #dupes hashtag, with the majority featuring creators sharing their best dupe finds across fashion, beauty, lifestyle and homeware. Most of the time they’re from fast fashion retailers like Shein, Amazon and Temu, but more recently, a new crop of companies have been dominating dupe culture by offering quite a different proposition. Take my friend’s new favourite brand, Quince. According to their website their mission is “to create products of equal or greater quality than the leading luxury brands at a much lower price”. To do so they’ve sourced factories used by “well-known luxury brands” to manufacture their goods, but by cutting out the middlemen and hefty markup, they can sell them at far more affordable prices. Quince's $100 handwoven Italian leather Hobo bag is a convincing dupe of the Bottega Jodie, which costs upwards of $2,800. They’re not the only ones. Leather goods manufacturer Sitoy Group Holdings regularly uploads videos on social media showcasing how the quality of its $100 handbags is almost identical to those sold for upwards of $1000, all the while advertising that they use the same production lines used by Prada, Tumi and Michael Kors. Then there's Chicjoc, one of the largest Chinese fashion apparel brands on Taobao and Tmall, claiming it uses the same fabric manufacturers as those used by the likes of Chanel, Valentino and Louis Vuitton. This shift towards high-quality dupes puts luxury brands in a difficult position. For decades, they’ve justified their high prices with the promise of superior craftsmanship and materials. They've even poked fun at these imitations. But when brands are offering near-identical goods allegedly manufactured in the same factory as luxury brands for much, much less, that justification starts to crumble. Another brand that has gained significant traction online this year is Los Angeles-based premium basics brand, Italic, with many consumers on Reddit expressing their satisfaction with the quality of the products. “Most of our products take 5–10 sample runs and 6–18 months, sometimes even longer,” says Italic CEO Jeremy Cai. “Our sourcing process involves rigorous vetting and ongoing quality controls, including factory certifications, samples, and production quality.” Italic doesn't market itself as a “dupe” brand, but its $200 Mongolian cashmere sweater claims to use comparable fabric to Cucinelli's $2300 version. This meticulous approach stands in stark contrast to what many might expect. Italic contacts 20-30 potential suppliers, evaluates 5-7 factories, and ultimately works with just 1-2 of them for any given product category, visiting each factory on-site. The key difference between Italic and the high-profile brands using the same factories, Cai explains, is in the pricing: “Most of our factories' clients sell for 2-4x more than our SRPs (Suggested Retail Prices), often much higher.” By cutting out the markup typically associated with luxury goods, Italic offers high-quality products at a more accessible price point. Cai is quick to point out that Italic does not market itself as a “dupe” brand. However, that hasn’t stopped consumers from drawing comparisons to more expensive luxury labels. In contrast, competitor Quince leans into dupe culture, positioning itself more overtly as a challenger to high-end brands. On Quince's website, woven intrecciato handbags, which resemble Bottega Veneta's iconic designs, are showcased alongside price comparisons to their luxury counterparts. Quince also frequently analyses luxury competitors’ best-selling items to identify opportunities for replication. “Data collection is crucial in our product development process,” says a Quince spokesperson. “Our team uses a variety of sources, including Google Trends, social media, and customer feedback, to understand the market and ensure we’re delivering what people want.” Quince’s strategy is built on the belief that luxury can—and should—be more accessible. “Our founding team, with years of experience in luxury and DTC (direct-to-consumer) retail, knew that competitors add a 40–60% markup on similar products,” continues the spokesperson. “As costs in the luxury market become more transparent, consumers are less willing to accept these inflated prices.” To that end, Quince works globally to source manufacturing partners that share their commitment to transparency, while innovating to keep costs down. Every product page on their site includes detailed information about materials, country of origin, and certifications for working conditions along the supply chain. Luxury brands, on the other hand, have traditionally kept their manufacturing processes shrouded in secrecy. William Lasry, founder of Glass Factory, is working to change that. Lasry travels the globe, visiting and spotlighting factories with superior craftsmanship and ethical practices across his social media platforms. While not all brands are doing their very best, he is sceptical about some companies' supposed connections to luxury factories, pointing out that these dupe brands frequently exploit this ambiguity for marketing purposes. “There are many instances where a factory will produce a sample for a luxury brand,” Lasry explains. “Luxury brands often request samples from hundreds of factories, but in many cases, nothing materialises beyond the sample stage. The factory might then turn around and claim, ‘We’ve made samples for Gucci,’ even though no production deal was ever finalised.” Petros Analytis, head of research at Glass Factory, agrees that it’s hard to draw the line. “Unless they let us come into the factories and see for ourselves, it’s hard to ascertain.” While transparency might be slowly improving, one thing the luxury market has always clung onto is its appeal. Conglomerates like LVMH and Kering built empires on the foundation of an alluring narrative—one that combines centuries of heritage with modern-day prestige. By blending Old World craftsmanship with the new-age glamour of celebrity culture, they made handbags, shoes, and clothing a gateway to an elite, exclusive world. For a long time consumers were happy to pay big bucks to belong in this world. Perhaps unknowingly, they were buying not just a product but an experience. The true value of a designer label wasn't simply measured by the stitching or material, but by the feeling it evoked—the confidence boost, the social status, the feeling of exclusivity. “It’s a real skill to make a handbag into an object desired by millions of women, one that has so much meaning and can do so much for your self-confidence,” notes Sherwood. The Hermés Birkin bag is one of the most desired handbags on the luxury market. Yet, behind the curtain of glamour, the reality of some products was very different. While consumers believed they were buying the pinnacle of luxury, what they were often getting was a product only marginally superior to midrange alternatives—and occasionally no better at all. The excessively high margins were less a reflection of quality and more a tax on the brands' appeal. “They are the architects of their own problems,” continues Sherwood. “By making so much of their products not about the tangible product, but about the intangible aspects of the brands - those sexy ads, the celebs who carry your products, the stores, the glossy ads, the slogans, the heritage backstory, all that stuff that isn’t actually the product itself.” In turn they’ve created an enormous gap between what consumers are actually paying for and the real value of the product. As these companies have increasingly pursued the ultra-wealthy, they’ve left a gap in the market that other brands, eager to capitalise, are starting to fill. “They know that the prices at the very top of luxury are too high to reflect the actual value,” Sherwood says. “But have turned these notable silhouettes and styles into desirable items that a dupe brand can free ride off of.” Then, recently, the veneer began to crack even further. In March, Italian luxury brand Loro Piana became embroiled in scandal after an investigation revealed the material behind their $9,000 sweaters was sourced by low-paid workers in Peru. Just a few months later, in July, Italian prosecutors alleged sweatshop-like conditions in factories supplying certain products for high-end labels such as Dior and Armani. The revelations triggered outrage among consumers, many of whom had long trusted these brands to uphold the highest standards of craftsmanship and ethics. Across online forums like the r/handbag subreddit, once-loyal customers voiced their disillusionment. For many, these scandals revealed that the luxury brands they idolised were not living up to their promises. Both Loro Piana and Dior have denied the allegations. However, The Business of Fashion revealed that Milan's public prosecutor said in a court document that they had found “an illegal practice so entrenched and proven [that it could] be considered part of a broader business policy exclusively aimed at increasing profit.” Neither company has been charged in relation to the probe. Such reputational damage couldn’t have come at a worse time for luxury brands. Coupled with the rise of dupe culture, these scandals are forcing consumers to rethink their relationship with high-end goods. If craftsmanship is no longer exceptional, and ethical practices are called into question, what exactly are people paying for when they buy luxury? Recent sales figures underline just how far demand for luxury mega-brands has fallen from its post-pandemic highs. In July, some of the industry’s biggest players reported disappointing revenues for the second consecutive quarter. LVMH, the world’s leading luxury conglomerate, missed sales estimates, while Gucci’s parent company Kering, experienced a decline of 11%. Other major brands like Richemont and Burberry also reported disappointing figures, with first-quarter sales plummeting by a staggering 20%. At the heart of luxury’s current struggles is the erosion of the very dream that once propelled the industry. The disconnect between the marketing mythology and the reality of production has left consumers feeling disillusioned, meaning the days of blindly paying a premium for a logo may be at risk. The democratisation of information and consumer power through social media has played a huge part in this. Platforms like TikTok and Reddit are filled with conversations that challenge the industry's value proposition, which has made it so much harder for luxury brands to control their narrative. To regain their position, Brittany Steiger, principal analyst of retail & eCommerce at Mintel says they will need to focus on what once made them so desirable—authenticity, superior craftsmanship, and a narrative of prestige that feels both aspirational and attainable. Some experts suggest that embracing more transparent practices and truly living up to their ethical and quality promises could also be the way forward. Brands that fail to do so, may find themselves increasingly irrelevant in a world where high-quality dupes continue to gain ground. It’s clear that the old model of luxury has been disrupted, and it’s no longer just about price anymore. In the battle between heritage and value, consumers are asking more questions—and luxury brands must have better answers. And if they don’t, there’s a whole industry on the sidelines who do.

            "content": "In what may be a first, the US Department of Justice this week charged a hacker with attempting to cause injury and death by launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against hospitals. Ahmed Omer and his brother Alaa are accused of carrying out a cyberattack spree that targeted hundreds of victims under the hacktivist banner Anonymous Sudan. The group’s DDoS victims included Microsoft’s Azure cloud services, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and Israel’s missile alert system, according to prosecutors. It was the brothers’ alleged attacks on hospitals, however, that drew the most serious accusations from the Justice Department, which singled out Ahmed for allegedly seeking to kill people with the crude cyberattacks that overwhelm systems, knocking them offline. If someone told you there’s a tool that can—using only open source information—create a “cyber profile” of you that can locate your phone in real time or place you at the scene of a crime at any date in the past, would you believe them? Canadian firm Global Intelligence claims to have created such a tool, dubbed Cybercheck, which it has sold to police departments across the US. Cybercheck-generated reports have been used to help convict at least two people of murder. However, a WIRED investigation found that Cybercheck’s reports have produced information that is either inaccurate or impossible to verify. And open source experts say some of the information Cybercheck claims to include—such as a device’s pings to a specific wireless network—would be impossible to obtain from publicly available sources. The scourge of nonconsensual deepfake images has continued to proliferate, including on Telegram, where millions of people used “nudify” bots to “remove the clothes” of anyone—usually women and girls. A WIRED investigation identified 50 such bots and 25 channels linked to the creation of these abusive AI-generated explicit images. Telegram removed all 75 channels and bots after WIRED reached out, but many of them will likely respawn. The slow death of the password may have gotten a speed boost this week. The FIDO Alliance, a tech industry association, announced new efforts to help hasten the adoption of passkeys, the cryptographically generated codes that are already replacing less-secure passwords. These efforts include a new Credential Exchange Protocol, which makes it easier to migrate passkeys between platforms and devices, and Passkey Central, a resource for company IT departments that aims to make it easier for organizations to adopt passkeys. A group of researchers revealed this week that they created an algorithm that generates a malicious prompt capable of instructing an AI chatbot to identify personal information fed into it by a user and secretly send it to an attacker. Finally, we went back in time to explore how well the US Army’s “solider of tomorrow,” unveiled 65 years ago this week, predicted the future of US military tech. And that’s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there. If you use uBlock Origin’s Chrome extension to filter out online ads, expect to get mildly annoyed in the near future. Google has begun implementing new Chrome extension standards, called Manifest V3, that will disable the legacy version of uBlock Origin’s extension that most users likely have installed. And while you might be thinking, “Google is a silverback gorilla of online advertising, of course they’re finally forcing me to see ads!” there is some good news. A new version of the ad-filtering extension that meets the Manifest V3 standards, uBlock Origin Lite, is now available. Then again, it won’t block as much as the previous iteration of uBlock. Still, as a Google spokesperson told The Verge, you have options: “The top content filtering extensions all have Manifest V3 versions available — with options for users of AdBlock, Adblock Plus, uBlock Origin and AdGuard.” Either way, you’ll need to install a new extension soon. US authorities announced charges this week against a 25-year-old Alabama man accused of hacking the Security and Exchange Commission’s X account. Prosecutors claim Eric Council Jr. obtained personal information and the materials for a fake ID of a person who controlled the @SECGov account from unidentified coconspirators. Council allegedly used the fake ID to carry out a SIM-swapping attack, duping AT&T retail store staff into giving him a new SIM card, which he ultimately used to take control of the victim’s phone account. The coconspirators used that to gain access to the SEC’s X account, where they posted a fake announcement about Bitcoin’s regulatory status, which was followed by a price jump of $1,000 per bitcoin. Council stands charged of conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud. The grocery store chain Kroger has never used facial-recognition technology broadly in its stores and has no current plans to, a spokesperson told Fast Company this week. The company has been facing a firestorm over its use of electronic shelving labels over concerns that ESLs could be used to impose surge pricing on popular items, and fears that the devices could also be deployed with facial recognition. The company did a single-store facial-recognition pilot of a technology called EDGE in 2019, but it did not move forward with the service. US lawmakers including Rashida Tlaib, Elizabeth Warren, and Robert Casey have publicly raised concerns about Kroger’s use of ESLs. Microsoft told customers that it failed to capture more than two weeks of security logs from certain cloud services in September, including Microsoft Entra, Sentinel, Defender for Cloud, and Purview. News of the lost logs was first reported by Business Insider. The company said in the notification that “a bug in one of Microsoft’s internal monitoring agents resulted in a malfunction in some of the agents when uploading log data to our internal logging platform.” The blank extends from September 2 to September 19. A Microsoft executive confirmed to TechCrunch that the incident was caused by an “operational bug within our internal monitoring agent.” System activity logs are crucial for all sorts of operations and are particularly used for security monitoring and investigations, because they can expose breaches and malicious activity. After Russian hackers breached US government networks through SolarWinds software in 2020, many agencies couldn’t detect the activity in their Microsoft Azure cloud services because they weren’t paying for Microsoft’s premium tier features, so they didn’t have adequate network activity logs. Lawmakers were outraged about the up-charge, and the Biden administration worked for more than two years to get Microsoft to make the logging services free. The company ultimately announced the change in July 2023.

            "content": "On Saturday, an Associated Press investigation revealed that OpenAI's Whisper transcription tool creates fabricated text in medical and business settings despite warnings against such use. The AP interviewed more than 12 software engineers, developers, and researchers who found the model regularly invents text that speakers never said, a phenomenon often called a “confabulation” or “hallucination” in the AI field. Upon its release in 2022, OpenAI claimed that Whisper approached “human level robustness” in audio transcription accuracy. However, a University of Michigan researcher told the AP that Whisper created false text in 80 percent of public meeting transcripts examined. Another developer, unnamed in the AP report, claimed to have found invented content in almost all of his 26,000 test transcriptions. The fabrications pose particular risks in health care settings. Despite OpenAI’s warnings against using Whisper for “high-risk domains,” over 30,000 medical workers now use Whisper-based tools to transcribe patient visits, according to the AP report. The Mankato Clinic in Minnesota and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles are among 40 health systems using a Whisper-powered AI copilot service from medical tech company Nabla that is fine-tuned on medical terminology. This story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast. Nabla acknowledges that Whisper can confabulate, but it also reportedly erases original audio recordings “for data safety reasons.” This could cause additional issues, since doctors cannot verify accuracy against the source material. And deaf patients may be highly impacted by mistaken transcripts since they would have no way to know if medical transcript audio is accurate or not. The potential problems with Whisper extend beyond health care. Researchers from Cornell University and the University of Virginia studied thousands of audio samples and found Whisper adding nonexistent violent content and racial commentary to neutral speech. They found that 1 percent of samples included “entire hallucinated phrases or sentences which did not exist in any form in the underlying audio” and that 38 percent of those included “explicit harms such as perpetuating violence, making up inaccurate associations, or implying false authority.” In one case from the study cited by AP, when a speaker described “two other girls and one lady,” Whisper added fictional text specifying that they “were Black.” In another, the audio said, “He, the boy, was going to, I’m not sure exactly, take the umbrella.” Whisper transcribed it to, “He took a big piece of a cross, a teeny, small piece … I’m sure he didn’t have a terror knife so he killed a number of people.” An OpenAI spokesperson told the AP that the company appreciates the researchers’ findings and that it actively studies how to reduce fabrications and incorporates feedback in updates to the model. The key to Whisper’s unsuitability in high-risk domains comes from its propensity to sometimes confabulate, or plausibly make up, inaccurate outputs. The AP report says, \"Researchers aren’t certain why Whisper and similar tools hallucinate,\" but that isn't true. We know exactly why Transformer-based AI models like Whisper behave this way. Whisper is based on technology that is designed to predict the next most likely token (chunk of data) that should appear after a sequence of tokens provided by a user. In the case of ChatGPT, the input tokens come in the form of a text prompt. In the case of Whisper, the input is tokenized audio data. The transcription output from Whisper is a prediction of what is most likely, not what is most accurate. Accuracy in Transformer-based outputs is typically proportional to the presence of relevant accurate data in the training dataset, but it is never guaranteed. If there is ever a case where there isn't enough contextual information in its neural network for Whisper to make an accurate prediction about how to transcribe a particular segment of audio, the model will fall back on what it “knows” about the relationships between sounds and words it has learned from its training data. According to OpenAI in 2022, Whisper learned those statistical relationships from “680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web.” But we now know a little more about the source. Given Whisper's well-known tendency to produce certain outputs like \"thank you for watching,\" \"like and subscribe,\" or \"drop a comment in the section below\" when provided silent or garbled inputs, it's likely that OpenAI trained Whisper on thousands of hours of captioned audio scraped from YouTube videos. (The researchers needed audio paired with existing captions to train the model.) There's also a phenomenon called “overfitting” in AI models where information (in this case, text found in audio transcriptions) encountered more frequently in the training data is more likely to be reproduced in an output. In cases where Whisper encounters poor-quality audio in medical notes, the AI model will produce what its neural network predicts is the most likely output, even if it is incorrect. And the most likely output for any given YouTube video, since so many people say it, is “thanks for watching.” In other cases, Whisper seems to draw on the context of the conversation to fill in what should come next, which can lead to problems because its training data could include racist commentary or inaccurate medical information. For example, if many examples of training data featured speakers saying the phrase “crimes by Black criminals,” when Whisper encounters a “crimes by [garbled audio] criminals” audio sample, it will be more likely to fill in the transcription with “Black.\" In the original Whisper model card, OpenAI researchers wrote about this very phenomenon: \"Because the models are trained in a weakly supervised manner using large-scale noisy data, the predictions may include texts that are not actually spoken in the audio input (i.e. hallucination). We hypothesize that this happens because, given their general knowledge of language, the models combine trying to predict the next word in audio with trying to transcribe the audio itself.\" So in that sense, Whisper \"knows\" something about the content of what is being said and keeps track of the context of the conversation, which can lead to issues like the one where Whisper identified two women as being Black even though that information was not contained in the original audio. Theoretically, this erroneous scenario could be reduced by using a second AI model trained to pick out areas of confusing audio where the Whisper model is likely to confabulate and flag the transcript in that location, so a human could manually check those instances for accuracy later. Clearly, OpenAI's advice not to use Whisper in high-risk domains, such as critical medical records, was a good one. But health care companies are constantly driven by a need to decrease costs by using seemingly \"good enough\" AI tools—as we've seen with Epic Systems using GPT-4 for medical records and UnitedHealth using a flawed AI model for insurance decisions. It's entirely possible that people are already suffering negative outcomes due to AI mistakes, and fixing them will likely involve some sort of regulation and certification of AI tools used in the medical field.

            "content": "By  Nilay Patel, editor-in-chief of The Verge, host of the Decoder podcast, and co-host of The Vergecast. On this week’s episode of Decoder, we’re talking about work. Specifically, where we work, how our expectations of working remotely were radically changed by the covid-19 pandemic, and how those expectations feel like they’re on the verge of changing yet again. For many people, the pendulum has swung wildly between working fully remote and now a push to return to the office from their bosses, and there are a lot of theories about what might be motivating big companies to try and bring everyone back. Here on Decoder, I’ve talked to lots of CEOs about the benefits of working fully remote versus hybrid or having everybody back in the office over the past several years, and I’ve heard the full spectrum of responses. Some executives are adamant that people need to be in the office, and others are equally adamant that fully remote is the way to go. We’ll play some of those answers for you as we go so you can get a sense of the enormous range of opinions here. If you look at the surveys, it’s basically 50/50 — quite a lot of people want to work remotely, and they can be pretty loud online. But there are a lot of people, who are often quieter, who want to go back to the office for pretty good reasons. Some folks just don’t have the space to work from home, or they’re simply tired of making video calls in sweatpants all day and never really leaving the house. I know some people who really like just being able to leave work at the office when they head home for the day, and I’ve heard from a lot of younger people who are struggling to get face time with the more senior and experienced people at their companies in order to build relationships and grow their networks. The messy middle of all this is what quite a few companies have settled on: hybrid work, which allows for a combination of in-office and remote work. This is how The Verge runs, and I quite like it — but it’s not perfect. Like so many people who work in a hybrid environment, there are days where I go into a mostly empty office and then sit on Zoom in a phone booth, and there are days when I realize I’m the only one in a meeting sitting at home because everyone else has gone into the office.  Figuring out how to make hybrid work is a long-term cultural project that we really only started in 2020. While there are some obvious benefits, it’s not clear if anyone’s really cracked it in a way that scales across different kinds of companies. Now, some companies have decided the nuance just isn’t worth it. In September, Amazon mandated that all employees would return to an office five days a week starting in January. In the memo announcing the change, CEO Andy Jassy argued that the company had “observed that it’s easier to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture,” that “collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective,” and that “teams tend to be better connected to one another” when everyone is in the office. Amazon isn’t alone in wanting employees back at their desks. Companies like Disney and Salesforce have also pushed for employees to come back to the office at least four days a week, making similar arguments. Other companies, like Apple, have been steadily pressuring workers to come back for quite some time — that beautiful new spaceship office in Cupertino wasn’t built to stay empty.  But is the return to office really about building company culture and being more creative and productive? I have to tell you, there is a huge chunk of The Verge and Decoder audience that is absolutely convinced that any big return-to-office policy change is actually just a layoff in disguise — we get emails making this case virtually every time one of these moves is announced. Jassy even addressed this directly, just a few days ago, in an all-hands meeting. Responding to claims that the return-to-work mandate is a quote “backdoor layoff,” he told employees that that is simply not true. We’ll come back to that later on.  So I wanted to know what’s been going on, what the real reasons behind return-to-office might be, and where this is all headed next. To explain it, I caught up with two experts on the subject: Stephan Meier, a professor of business strategy at Columbia Business School, and Jessica Kriegel, the chief strategy officer at workplace culture consultancy Culture Partners.  We dive into what’s been happening to the nature of work today, and you’ll hear both of them lay out some of the key reasons behind the return-to-office push. We also try to figure out whether Amazon is just an outlier or, as you’ll hear Jessica say, “the tip of the spear” in what could be something much bigger.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Canva has added a bunch of new AI features to its web-based design platform, including updates for generating text and video effects and a more powerful text-to-image app. The latter is called “Dream Lab” — a new image generator tool born from Canva’s acquisition of generative AI startup Leonardo.ai earlier this year. Dream Lab is powered by Leonardo’s Phoenix model (not be be confused with Adobe’s Firefly AI) and allows users to generate images from descriptions in a variety of styles like “3D render” and “Illustration.”  Canva already has its own Stable Diffusion-based AI image generator and hosts several other third-party apps, but the new Dream Lab offering introduces some improvements to the platform. It’s seemingly better at producing photographic styles and multi-subject images, for example, and includes a feature that can reference an existing image to better control the output — similar to Photoshop’s Reference Image tool. Canva has also made some updates to its wider “Magic” AI tool suit, such as improved accuracy and one-click autocomplete commands for the Magic Write text generation feature. Whiteboards now support AI-powered summarization and real-time reaction stickers for collaborative projects and video editing tools have been added that automatically generate captions and introduce new animation effects. Users can now add interactive charts and graphs to their presentations to help better visualize data. The Canva asset library has also been expanded with new royalty-free music and cinematic videos courtesy of a licensing deal with the Artlist music platform. Canva announced last month that it’s planning to increase its subscription pricing for some business customers to reflect the “expanded product experience” and value that generative AI tools have added to the platform. The Leonardo.AI purchase was likely included in its investment plan, but users may be disappointed that they’re paying increased costs for incremental improvements rather than entirely new generative AI capabilities.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

After its success with Fallout and the recently released Like A Dragon: Yakuza show, Mass Effect is the next game Amazon wants to adapt. According to Variety, a show based on BioWare’s military space opera RPG is officially in production at Amazon MGM Studios. Variety has reported that F9: The Fast Saga writer Daniel Casey has signed on to write the show with BioWare producer Mike Gamble serving as executive produce along with Ari Arad. Though BioWare released the Mass Effect Legendary Edition — a collection of the first three games updated for modern consoles — back in 2021, the Mass Effect series hasn’t had an original entry since the release of Mass Effect: Andromeda back in 2017. After Andromeda, BioWare released Anthem, a live-service action game that was significant departure from the studio’s tradition of making single-player, story-driven RPGs. In 2020, BioWare announced that a new Mass Effect game was in-development. News of a Mass Effect TV show comes on what is known as N7 Day, a semi-official, fan-created holiday that celebrates all things Mass Effect. On previous N7 Days, BioWare has teased information about the next game in the series including a trailer that possibly suggested the return of fan-favorite protagonist Commander Shepard whose story ended with the original trilogy. Though no story details have been revealed about the show, it’s a pretty safe bet to guess it’ll focus on the Commander and I personally can’t wait to see her.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

The first cracks are starting to show in Netflix’s push into gaming. First reported in Game File and confirmed by Netflix, the streaming company has quietly closed of one of its studios, the first in the three years since the company began its foray into gaming. According to Game File, the shuttered studio was known as Blue. In 2022, Netflix announced it hired former Overwatch executive producer Chacko Sonny to run the studio. Since then, Blue had brought on a number of game industry veterans with experience working on high profile franchises including Halo and God of War. Reportedly, Blue was developing a multi-platform AAA game for an original IP but was closed before the game could be announced or released. Netflix has released a steady stream of games on its platform since the beginning of its gaming experiment in 2021. Though it started with a small handful of hyper-casual mobile games, Netflix’s offerings have expanded to include mobile exclusive ports of iconic games like Grand Theft Auto and Hades its own internally developed exclusives like Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit and Oxenfree II: Lost Signals. Netflix has also acquired or spun-up a number of studios to support its gaming pipeline. The most recent additions were a mobile game studio in Helsinki, a new studio in southern California, and Cozy Grove developer Spry Fox. But with the closure of Blue, Netflix’s trend of expansion may be over as well as its grander AAA ambitions.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Google is building a bunch of AI products, and it’s using AI quite a bit as part of building those products, too. “More than a quarter of all new code at Google is generated by AI, then reviewed and accepted by engineers,” CEO Sundar Pichai said on the company’s third quarter 2024 earnings call. It’s a big milestone that marks just how important AI is to the company. AI is helping Google make money as well. Alphabet reported $88.3 billion in revenue for the quarter, with Google Services (which includes Search) revenue of $76.5 billion, up 13 percent year-over-year, and Google Cloud (which includes its AI infrastructure products for other companies) revenue of $11.4 billion, up 35 percent year-over-year. Operating incomes were also strong. Google Services hit $30.9 billion, up from $23.9 billion last year, and Google Cloud hit $1.95 billion, significantly up from last year’s $270 million. The results indicate that, while many people feel Google isn’t as reliable as it once was, the company continues to operate a very strong business. AI is a huge focus across Google, with the release of features like custom AI chatbots powered by Gemini (called “Gems”), automatic AI note-taking in Google Meet, and a bunch of generative AI tools to help YouTube creators. Google’s well-reviewed Pixel 9 lineup of smartphones were also packed with AI tools. “In Search, our new AI features are expanding what people can search for and how they search for it,” CEO Sundar Pichai says in a statement. “In Cloud, our AI solutions are helping drive deeper product adoption with existing customers, attract new customers and win larger deals. And YouTube’s total ads and subscription revenues surpassed $50 billion over the past four quarters for the first time.” Google is facing a potentially tough road ahead, however, following the August ruling that the company is a monopolist in the search and advertising markets. That case, brought by the US Department of Justice, is now in its remedies phase, and while there’s still a ways to go for the dust to settle, a Google breakup is on the table.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

He’s been a tech journalist for almost 20 years. If you’ve ever experienced the sight and sound of a split-flap display then you’ll immediately understand the nostalgic appeal of Miniot’s pixelated wall clock. Klapklok uses mechanical flaps to convey information, just like the departure boards commonly found in transportation terminals before the arrival of LEDs. As its name suggests, Klapklok primarily functions as a low resolution clock, showing the hour and minute hands using 69 (nice) “paper-like” flaps that act like black and white pixels. But Klapklok also features a Bluetooth app to create pixel drawings if that’s your thing.  As a clock, a selection of the flaps are redrawn every 2.5 minutes with a soothing rustle to show the progression of the hands. At the top of the hour all 69 flaps shuffle at once to display the time in numbers. That makes Klapklock the “gentlest cuckoo clock you’ve ever heard,” according to Miniot. I think the smooth pixel movement looks great, but it really is the sound that sold me when I first saw a working prototype last year. Here, listen for yourself. The USB-C powered clock is a 17.7-inch (45cm) squircle that’s just 0.5 inches (13mm) thick and weighs 3.7 pounds (1.7kg). When the pixels are at rest it’s completely silent, there’s no light, and it uses very little power. It’s expensive because the array of flaps, spools, hinges, magnets, and electronics are all hand assembled in Peter Kolkman’s home workshop — the same place that this small family-run business eventually refined its impressive Wheel record player that plays vinyl vertically. Klapklok will eventually retail for €2,400 (about $2,600). However, it’s temporarily reduced to €1,800 (about $1,950) for the first batch of 25 which are scheduled to ship by December 12th to meet the Christmas deadline.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Nintendo hasn’t announced its Switch successor yet, but we do know one thing for sure: it will be able to play current Switch games and have carryover for your Nintendo Switch Online services and account. The news was announced during Nintendo’s midyear policy briefing, with further information promised “at a later date.” Nintendo also talked about numbers for the current Switch (PDF), noting that it sold 4.72 million units in the past three months, a drop of 31 percent compared to the same period last year but well above previous consoles eight years after they launched.  That adds up to 146 million Switch units sold and a new record for software sales on a Nintendo platform, which reached 1.3 billion units as of September 30th, 2024. It also noted that Switch Online subscriptions dropped slightly from last year to about 34 million members. At the same time, the number of people opting for the pricier version with the Expansion Pack library of games continues to increase. According to the presentation, “More software has been played on Nintendo Switch than on any other Nintendo hardware.” All three of the major console manufacturers have had spotty records with backward compatibility. Both the Xbox Series X and the PS5 are mostly backward-compatible. But since the transition from the Wii U involved going from discs to cartridges, the Switch is not. Playing a game from previous Nintendo consoles at the moment is a function of optimism, involving the hope that either Nintendo releases a remastered Switch port or brings the game to its Switch Online library, but that won’t be the case this time around. According to Nintendo, the Switch 2 (or whatever it’s actually called) is still on schedule to be revealed during this fiscal year, which runs until the end of March 2025, without interrupting Nintendo’s existing connection with over 100 million annual Switch players.  The conversation about backward compatibility isn’t just about player satisfaction but also video game preservation. A report from the Video Game History Foundation found that over 87 percent of games released before 2010 are “critically endangered” or unavailable for purchase. While Nintendo has brought some of its back catalog to the Switch, there are still a lot of inaccessible games. Nintendo also directly contributed to the increasing scarcity of older games by shutting down the Wii U / 3DS e-shop last year. The news comes as Nintendo seemed intent on announcing everything but details on its next console. The last few weeks have included the opening of a museum, a test for a mystery MMO, the reveal of an alarm clock, and the launch of a music streaming app. Update, November 5th, 2024: Added additional details.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Take-Two Interactive is selling off its indie games label Private Division, which published titles such as The Outer Worlds and OlliOlli World, following rumors over the summer that Take-Two laid off most of Private Division’s staff. Take-Two did not disclose the buyer of Private Division or how much they paid. In an emailed statement to The Verge, Take-Two spokesperson Alan Lewis wrote: We recently made the strategic decision to sell our Private Division label to focus our resources on growing our core and mobile businesses for the long-term. As part of this transaction, the buyer purchased our rights to substantially all of Private Division’s live and unreleased titles.  Take-Two will continue to support No Rest for the Wicked, which launched in Early Access on PC in April. We are grateful for the contributions that the Private Division team has made to our company and are confident that they will continue to achieve success in their new home. According to Bloomberg, the label has been plagued by “a string of flops, including Kerbal Space Program 2, which was full of bugs and panned by fans. Private Division games, including the upcoming Lord of the Rings farm simulator Tales of the Shire as well as Pokémon developer Game Freak’s untitled game known as “Project Bloom,” will move over to the new buyer. However, Private Division’s buyer won’t get the rights to No Rest for the Wicked. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick told GamesIndustry.biz that the buyer would be named soon and said, “The team of Private Division did a great job supporting independent developers and, almost to a one, every project they supported did well. However, the scale of those projects was, candidly, on the smaller side, and we’re in the business of making great big hits,” like the upcoming Grand Theft Auto VI.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

WordPress cofounder Matt Mullenweg and his company Automattic have asked a court to dismiss WP Engine’s lawsuit accusing them of libel and extortion. In a filing on Wednesday, Mullenweg argues that WP Engine is conjuring claims “out of legal thin air,” while alleging it continues to use the WordPress trademark “in unauthorized ways.” Earlier this month, the third-party WordPress hosting service WP Engine filed a lawsuit against Automattic and Mullenweg after the executive embarked on a “scorched earth nuclear” campaign against it. In addition to accusing WP Engine of trademark infringement, Mullenweg claimed the service doesn’t contribute enough to the open-source WordPress.org project, which Mullenweg also controls. WordPress.org also cut off WP Engine’s access to its resources and later took over one of its most popular plugins. As noted in the filing, Mullenweg claims he has “no obligation to provide” WordPress.org’s resources to WP Engine. “The mere fact that WP Engine made the risky decision to base its growing business on a site to which it has no rights or guarantee of access, without making backup plans, is not enough for it to conjure a claim out of legal thin air,” the filing reads.  Mullenweg goes on to claim WP Engine has “chosen without justification to attack Automattic and Matt,” despite allegedly having “no legal (or moral) rights” to WordPress.org’s free services. This very public spat has raised concerns among developers across the WordPress ecosystem who now worry whether they, too, could get cut off from WordPress. But Mullenweg doesn’t seem too worried about the impact. During an interview at TechCrunch’s Disrupt event on Wednesday, Mullenweg said his fight against WP Engine is “obviously” worth the risk. A hearing for WP Engine’s case against WordPress is currently scheduled for next March.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

The developers at Hello Games are back with yet another update for No Man’s Sky. Starting today, a select number of users will have the ability to play around in their NMS universe across a collection of platforms with the new cross-save functionality. According to the announcement, adding cross-saving was a bit of an undertaking for the development team. “It’s very common for players to rack up thousands of hours of saves,” the announcement reads. “Adding cross-save for us is a little bit like moving house, the longer people have lived there the more complicated it is to move them.” No Man’s Sky now supports cross-saves across PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Series S/X, Xbox Game Pass, PC, Steam Deck, PSVR 1 / 2, PCVR, GOG, and Nintendo Switch. Players can visit this site to link their different platform accounts and read the cross-save FAQ. However, only a select few players will be able to play their saves across different platforms with Hello Games rolling out the functionality to more players in the coming days. November 7th is known in the BioWare fandom as N7 Day (get it, November 7th) — a semi-official community holiday celebrating all things Mass Effect. In 2021, Hello Games introduced Mass Effect’s famous starship, the SSV Normandy SR-1 as a collectible ship. For this year’s N7 Day, the Normandy is back for players to claim for a limited time. In addition to cross-saves and cool ships, to coincide with the launch of the PS5 Pro, No Man’s Sky is also getting an enhanced version compatible with the souped up console. Updated features include 4K resolution at 60fps, support for 8K resolution at 30fps, and improved lighting.  All three updates are available now and are completely free.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Adi has covered video games, biohacking, and more for The Verge since 2011.  Hackers released a collection of leaked data from Pokémon game developer Game Freak over the weekend, including personal information about employees. Game Freak — which develops the main lineup of Pokémon video games — confirmed the breach in a statement, saying (per a machine translation from Japanese) that it was the result of “unauthorized access to our servers by a third party” and dated back to August of 2024. Game Freak said the leaked personal information — which it characterizes as names and company email addresses — included around 2,600 items. As Polygon notes, however, the breach appears to include much more than employee information. Redditors and others say they’ve unearthed source code from previous games as well as unused pokémon designs and other things that were scrapped during the development process of those games. They’ve allegedly found more limited detail about future projects, including some codenames for future games. There are no apparent reports of direct leaks from the other companies involved in Pokémon as part of this breach, including Nintendo, Creatures Inc., and the jointly owned Pokémon Company. Game Freak’s statement, which is dated to October 10th but, according to Polygon, appeared on the 13th, says the server has since been secured and that the company is taking steps to bolster its security measures.

See our ethics statement. Kindles and Kobos are relatively comfortable to use, but if those are too big and restrictive, the smartphone-like Boox Palma is a fantastic alternative that’s grown on us considerably. A new model is on its way, but if you don’t need the smoother performance it promises, you can save a bit on the original today. It’s down to $245.99 ($34 off) at Amazon, which is a new all-time low price. The Boox Palma is a 6.1-inch smartphone size e-reader that’s highly portable. It also runs on Android and comes with the Google Play Store built-in, allowing you to download apps for other digital bookstores, newspapers, note-taking apps, and more.  The Palma’s hardware sheet and appearance resemble a smartphone, but it has neither calling capabilities nor a traditional display. It uses a 6.13-inch backlit E Ink Carta 1200 display instead, offering a crisp 300 ppi resolution. There’s a microphone and speaker, a microSD card slot for expanding its 128GB of internal storage, volume buttons that can double as page-turning buttons, and even a 16-megapixel camera with a flash for scanning documents and handwritten notes. Its pocket-stowable and one-handed form factor makes it more ideal for your everyday carry than a full-sized reader. One big advantage of the Boox Palma compared to most ebook readers is that it runs Android 11 with Google Play, so you can supplement its built-in tools and apps by downloading anything else you like. That means you aren’t locked into any particular ebook ecosystem and don’t have to ditch your favorite sources. Missing your Amazon Kindle library? Just download the Kindle app — a much better proposition than manually sideloading everything. You can also use your preferred music streaming service and news apps. However, the laggy user experience that befalls any E Ink device can be limiting outside of reading and perhaps some casual listening and productivity tasks (and even some New York Times’ crossword puzzles, The Verge’s David Pierce found). It’s fine if you’re just scrolling through pages of your monthly reads, but not ideal for social media deep-diving and other visually rich shenanigans.  The incoming Boox Palma 2 brings a faster octa-core chipset and an Android 13 upgrade (and adds a fingerprint sensor), but no one has tested it yet to find out whether those changes will translate to improved usability in a practical sense. If you’re looking to save a bit and start reading today, you may not miss much by staying a generation behind.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

See our ethics statement. Apple has now revealed the entirety of its M4 Mac lineup. It includes a new entry-level MacBook Pro with M4 for $1,599, as well as the step-up M4 Pro (or M4 Max) models in 14- and 16-inch sizes, which once again start at $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. We’re also getting a new 24-inch iMac with M4, plus an updated Mac Mini with an incredibly small build and an M4 chip. Preorders for the desktop machines start at $1,299 and $599, respectively, and all of the new hardware launches on November 8th. Besides faster processors, a common theme among the 2024 Macs is that they all start with more RAM to aid the Apple Intelligence experience arriving as part of macOS Sequoia 18.1. Apple doubled the memory from 8GB to 16GB on the entry-level M4 MacBook Pro, the M4 iMac, and the M4 Mac Mini. The MacBook Pros with M4 Pro, meanwhile, now offer 18GB as opposed to 24GB. Most of the new machines look familiar otherwise, with the exception of the M4 Mac Mini. The new model is considerably smaller than the M2 Mini from last year, and features a reshuffled I/O configuration — the front has a 3.5mm audio jack and two USB-C / Thunderbolt ports, while the rear gets three additional USB-C ports in addition to a gigabit ethernet and HDMI port. However, the base M4 Mini still uses Thunderbolt 4, while the M4 Pro model gets Thunderbolt 5.  The same Thunderbolt disparity is true between the M4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pros, though all three get upgraded 12-megapixel webcams with support for Apple’s Desk View mode, along with optional nano-texture displays for reducing glare. The iMac looks the same compared to its predecessor, but also gets the 12-megapixel camera bump and a few new colors.  We haven’t tested the new M4 MacBooks, Mac Minis, or iMac (yet), but if you fancy yourself an early adopter, there are a lot of preorder options to consider.  The base M4 MacBook is still only available in a 14-inch configuration, but it now comes with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD at its $1,599 starting price. Apple also threw in an extra USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 port on the right side and added space black as a color option. Apple is accepting preorders right now ahead of the laptop’s November 8th release date. You can upgrade to 1TB of storage for an extra $200 before checkout or 2TB of storage for an additional $400. The same for the RAM; you can get 24GB for another $200 or 32GB for $400. You can also opt for a nano-texture display that reduces screen reflectivity for another $150. The entry-level MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM — double that of its predecessor — for the same starting price of $1,599. It also gets an extra USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 port and comes in a new space black option. You can now preorder the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro (12-core CPU and 16-core GPU), 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage from Apple for $1,999. Stepping up to the 14-core CPU / 20-core GPU version of the M4 Pro chip is an added $200. You can also get a 1TB SSD for $200, 2TB for $600, or 4TB for $1,200. Doubling the RAM to 48GB is another $400.  You can also upgrade the new MacBook Pro to an M4 Max chip. The 14-core CPU / 32-core GPU version is an $800 upgrade and comes with 36GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD to start. You can also preorder a model with a 16-core CPU and 40-core GPU for an extra $1,100. Going with that configuration increases starting RAM to 48GB, plus further upgrade options of 64GB for another $200 or 128GB for an extra $1,000. It’s also the only way to get 8TB of storage, which is an extra $2,200. The 16-inch MacBook Pro is even pricier, naturally. It starts at $2,499 from Apple with a 14-core / 20-core M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD with the same RAM and upgrade options as the 14-inch model. The M4 Max model starts you out with 14 CPU cores, 32 GPU cores, 36GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage for $3,499, with the same SSD upgrades but no option to increase memory. If you want additional RAM, you’ll need the $3,999 model with the 16-core / 40-core M4 Max, which starts with 48GB of RAM and is upgradeable to either 64GB or 128GB. You can get the glare-reducing nano-textured display in both the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro configurations for an extra $150, and both are available in space black and silver.  The 14-inch MacBook Pro with a 12-core / 16-core M4 Pro chip starts with 24GB of RAM — a 6GB increase over the prior generation. It also has a 512GB SSD, three Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports, an optional nano-texture display, and a 12-megapixel webcam. The 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro starts with 24GB of RAM and offers more computing cores (14 for the CPU and 20 for the GPU) compared to the 14-inch model. It also picks up Thunderbolt 5 ports and a new 12-megapixel camera with support for Apple’s Desk View mode. The iMac comes with a Magic Keyboard and your choice of a Magic Mouse or a Magic Trackpad (the latter of which costs $50 extra), all of which now feature USB-C ports. It will be available on November 8th, but you can preorder it now from Apple in green, yellow, orange, pink, purple, blue, and silver, with the base model starting at $1,299. It’s also up for preorder in select configurations at Amazon for the same price or at Best Buy for $50 off with a My Best Buy Plus or Total membership, which start at $50 a year. The entry-level version offers a pair of Thunderbolt / USB 4 ports, along with an 8-core CPU and an 8-core GPU. It also offers 16GB of RAM, but you can upgrade to 24GB for $200 more. The iMac also features 256GB of storage by default, but an extra $200 gets you 512GB of storage, while $400 more gets you 1TB of storage. For another $200, you can add nano-textured glass, which helps scatter light and minimize screen glare. The higher-end models, meanwhile, are available from Apple, Amazon, and Best Buy starting at $1,499 and come with four Thunderbolt 4 ports, 16GB RAM, and 256GB of storage. Paying $200 extra allows you to upgrade to either 24GB of RAM or 512GB of storage. If you need even more storage, you can get 1TB or 2TB for an extra $400 or $800, respectively. Apple also lets you upgrade to 32GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $400 extra. The latest version of Apple’s all-in-one desktop computer features an M4 chip and support for Apple Intelligence. Unlike its predecessor, the base model now offers 16GB RAM by default, along with a new 12MP webcam. The M4 Mac Mini is currently available from Apple, Amazon, and Best Buy starting at $599 in its base configuration, which includes a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. You can upgrade to 512GB of storage for an additional $200, 1TB for $400, or 2TB for $800. RAM surcharges are similar; jumping to 24GB of RAM adds another $200 to your total, and you can get it with up to 32GB of RAM for $400.  As for the model with the M4 Pro chip, you can preorder it from Apple, Amazon, and Best Buy starting at $1,399 with a 12-core CPU and a 16-core GPU, 24GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. Upgrading the M4 Pro to a 14-core CPU and 20-core GPU costs an extra $200. You can also double the storage to 1TB for $200, get 2TB for $600, 4TB for $1,200, or max out with 8TB for $2,400. Memory upgrades are similarly pricey, with 48GB adding $400 to the total and 64GB adding $600. Both the M4 and M4 Pro Mac Minis allow you to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for an extra $100, too. There’s only one color (silver), by the way, and neither package includes a mice or keyboard. Both will start shipping on November 8th. The latest Mac Mini features Apple’s upgraded M4 chips and a smaller build than the prior model. Each configuration now starts with 16GB of RAM and includes five total Thunderbolt ports, gigabit ethernet, HDMI, and a 3.5mm jack. Update, October 30th: Added preorder details regarding Apple’s new M4 MacBook Pro models. We also added new retailer links for the M4 Mac Mini.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Ford is idling the factory where it makes its F-150 Lightning electric pickup trucks until next year, the company said today. It’s another unwelcome hiccup in Ford’s path to becoming a global EV producer.  The plan is to shut things down after the last shift on Friday, November 15th, at which point the plant will be closed for seven weeks, including holidays in which no work would have occurred anyway. The reasons are a bit vague, with Ford spokesperson Emma Berg citing a need to “adjust production for an optimal mix of sales growth and profitability.” That last word — profitability — is surely driving most of this decision. While Tesla just had a  better-than-expected earnings quarter, Ford is still struggling to squeeze profit out of its Model e division, which covers EVs, software, and more.  The plan is to shut things down after the last shift on Friday, November 15th The company reported losing $1.2 billion during the third quarter of this year on Model e, and projects that it will lose $5 billion on its EV business for the whole year. The company cited “industrywide pricing pressure” as among the reasons for the losses.  When it first came out, the F-150 Lightning was held up as enormously important for Ford’s long-term growth and vision. An electrified version of the world’s most popular pickup truck, and America’s most popular vehicle? Obviously Ford was going to print money on this model.  But the Lightning has had a rocky start. Prices have been slashed, production paused and restarted, and dealership inventory has remained a sticking point. The Tesla Cybertruck, that low poly lightning rod of praise and ridicule, recently outpaced the F-150 Lightning (and truly every electric truck on the market) in sales.  The last time Ford idled the plant was to increase its size to expand production. The company anticipated making 70,000 trucks a year in the newly enlarged factory. As of this most recent quarter, Ford has delivered 22,807 Lightnings.  The company is likely to keep running into these challenges as it scrambles to develop a next-generation EV platform to that is more low-cost than its current one. Ford has a “skunkworks” team in Silicon Valley developing this new platform right now. But in the meantime, it needs to sell more F-150 Lightnings.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Sean Hollister, a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget. DJI, the world’s largest drone company, is suing to avoid being seen as a tool of the Chinese government. On Friday, it sued the US Department of Defense to delete its name from a list of “Chinese Military Companies,” claiming it has no such relationship to Chinese authorities and has suffered unfairly as a result of that designation. Since DJI was added to that list in 2022, the company claims, it has “lost business deals, been stigmatized as a national security threat, and been banned from contracting with multiple federal government agencies,” and that its employees “now suffer frequent and pervasive stigmatization” and are “repeatedly harassed and insulted in public places.” It also alleges that the DoD would not offer the company any explanation for its designation as a “Chinese Military Company” until DJI threatened a lawsuit this September, and claims that when the DoD finally offered up its reasoning, it was filled with errors.  “The Department of Defense does not provide information or statements regarding any pending litigation matters,\" DoD spokesperson Maj. Selena Rodts tells The Verge.  You can read DJI’s full argument that it’s not owned or controlled by the Chinese military in the complaint below: Regardless of whether the DoD has enough evidence to label DJI this way, it’s far from the only US government entity that’s been inclined to restrict and scrutinize the company over possible ties to the Chinese government. The US Army asked units to stop using DJI drones as early as 2017.  In 2019, the US Interior Department grounded its fleet of DJI drones over spying risks. In 2020, the US Department of Commerce added DJI to its Entity List, banning US companies from exporting technology to DJI after it “enabled wide-scale human rights abuses within China through abusive genetic collection and analysis or high-technology surveillance.” In 2021, the US Treasury added DJI to its list of Non-SDN Chinese Military Industrial Complex Companies, writing that it had provided drones to the Chinese government so it could conduct surveillance of Uyghurs, and suggesting that DJI was complicit in serious human rights abuse as a result.  Some US government entities were restricted from buying new DJI drones following these various actions. And this past week, DJI reported that some of its drones have been blocked by US customs using the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act as justification. In its defense, DJI has repeatedly claimed it isn’t owned or controlled by the Chinese government, that it’s had “nothing to do with treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang,” that it’s simply selling drones that may be used for various purposes that are out of its control afterwards, that many of those purposes have helped entities (including first responders) in the United States, and that independent audits by consulting firms and US government agencies (including the DoD) have found no security threats. While DJI does admit in the complaint that two Chinese state-owned investment funds did make minority investments in the company, it claims the Shanghai Free Trade Zone Equity Fund has “less than 1% of DJI’s shares and less than 0.1% of DJI’s voting rights,” and that the Chengtong Fund ended its investment in June 2023.  (DJI says just four people control 99 percent of DJI and own 87 percent of its shares — DJI founder and early employees Frank Wang, Henry Lu, Swift Xie, and Li Zexiang.) Congress is currently considering a complete import ban of new DJI drones and other equipment in the United States by suggesting they pose a national security risk — though that ban is currently on ice. While the House of Representatives did approve it after it was tacked onto the must-pass National Defense Authorization Act, the Senate’s version of the bill doesn’t currently contain the ban (though it might still add it back). But until the US customs hold-up, which DJI is suggesting is just a misunderstanding, the US government hadn’t taken any actions that would keep stores from importing drones, consumers from buying them, or individual pilots from flying them in the United States. Even should Congress ban new DJI drones from being sold, the proposed text of those bills suggests existing owners could keep flying the ones they own.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "AA  lot has been said about TV in 2004. That it was the best year of television of all time, the peak of the Golden Age of television. Or maybe that it was the year reality television became too much, suddenly showing up on every channel as we flipped the switch. But as famed Hollywood producer and UFO enthusiast Bryce Zabel wrote for the Los Angeles Times in 2004, it was the end of television as we knew it. He chalked it up to the prevalence of TiVo and DVR in American households and predicted an upheaval so severe the whole advertising business would crumble — and he didn’t even know about streaming yet. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe shift was one that a lot of people felt in real time. For many, it was through the show Lost, which debuted in 2004 and created a fervor among obsessives trying to understand the show’s central mysteries. For me, it was a smaller but equally influential show: Veronica Mars.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn true early aughts fashion, for me, it was an AIM away message that started it all: “BRB Watching Veronica Mars.” It was the days before one could text or doomscroll while watching TV, and setting a solid away message while you stepped away from the family computer to watch a show was key. Earlier that day, in school, my friends and I had been discussing the previous episode in anticipation like we did every week, dissecting the storylines and proposing our own theories of who-done-it (no spoilers here — if you haven’t seen it, watch it!). I came back to the computer during one of the commercial breaks, and there was a message from my friend with a link to Television Without Pity’s latest Veronica Mars recap, with the caption “DID YOU SEE THIS?” In that particular recap, the author Couch Baron had made the same joke I made to her earlier that day almost word by word. I clicked.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recap was long, thorough, and meant to catch TiVo-less fans up on what they missed the previous week.

For many, it was through the show Lost, which debuted in 2004 and created a fervor among obsessives trying to understand the show’s central mysteries. For me, it was a smaller but equally influential show: Veronica Mars.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn true early aughts fashion, for me, it was an AIM away message that started it all: “BRB Watching Veronica Mars.” It was the days before one could text or doomscroll while watching TV, and setting a solid away message while you stepped away from the family computer to watch a show was key. Earlier that day, in school, my friends and I had been discussing the previous episode in anticipation like we did every week, dissecting the storylines and proposing our own theories of who-done-it (no spoilers here — if you haven’t seen it, watch it!). I came back to the computer during one of the commercial breaks, and there was a message from my friend with a link to Television Without Pity’s latest Veronica Mars recap, with the caption “DID YOU SEE THIS?” In that particular recap, the author Couch Baron had made the same joke I made to her earlier that day almost word by word. I clicked.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recap was long, thorough, and meant to catch TiVo-less fans up on what they missed the previous week. Reading through it, though, I felt like the writer was one of my friends who I discussed the show with, only he was funnier than us and could go on for pages and pages offering context, theories, and Easter eggs we would never think of.

            "content": "By  Allison Johnson, a reviewer with 10 years of experience writing about consumer tech. She has a special interest in mobile photography and telecom. Previously, she worked at DPReview. At the risk of stating the obvious, AI is absolutely everywhere lately. There’s AI in your car, AI in your messaging app, AI in your glasses. I’ve gotten pretty desensitized to it all as a hazard of the job, but it was Spotify’s AI DJ that actually got my attention.  I’ve listened to a top 40 radio station in the past two decades, so I’m familiar with the concept of a robot picking music for me. In that context, an AI DJ doesn’t seem like much of a stretch. But after using it on and off for a week, I’m convinced it’s the perfect analogy for our AI-everything moment. It’s eerily human, and it plays a lot of music I like. But take it from someone with access to a high-quality local indie radio station — one that employs human DJs! — there just ain’t nothing like the real thing. Spotify’s AI DJ has been around since early 2023, but it piqued my interest recently when I was scrounging around the app looking for some work-friendly tunes. The AI voice greeted me by name, then after a little preamble, told me it had some “dream pop and neo-psychedelic waves” picked out. As the music started, I was annoyed at how extremely my shit it was. I shouldn’t have been surprised, considering that Spotify has nearly a decade’s worth of data on my musical listening habits. It drew on my previous listening for the next track, too: a song by Classixx, whose Hanging Gardens album I listened to on repeat last year. But while I listened to Hanging Gardens on Spotify, I didn’t discover it there. I heard it first on KEXP — a local station where real humans pick the music. See, here in Seattle, we’re extremely spoiled. In between the robot-programmed, conglomerate-owned stations, we have a real honest-to-god independent station on our radio dials: 90.3, to be precise. I started listening to KEXP through their online stream years before I moved to Seattle. Being a local has only made me more of a fan; I celebrated the opening of the “new” KEXP location in 2016 and saw one of my favorite bands play a free in-studio show there not long before they broke up. I’ve logged countless hours working on my laptop in the community gathering space. Being able to walk into my favorite radio station and just like, hang out, remains cool as hell all these years later. I wish every city in the country had a KEXP. It’s not that I like everything that I hear on KEXP. “The Friday song” is banned in my house because my husband and I are both so sick of it. And as much as I’ve tried, I can’t get into Wet Leg. It’s a me problem. But that’s kind of the point of a radio station, isn’t it? You hear some stuff you like and some stuff you’re not as into. Maybe you hear a song you forgot about but love or a band you dig that you’ve never heard before. It’s a well-rounded meal, while an AI-curated set feels like a dessert buffet. It’s all the stuff you love, and it’s great at first, but then it gives you a stomach ache after a while. It hits different than when it comes from an algorithm In the era of Spotify algorithms and top 40 stations, a DJ might seem like an abstract concept. But KEXP’s DJs are very much real people that I see out in the community, emceeing local music festivals and shopping at the co-op grocery store. It’s an obvious but crucial difference. When a real human plays a song you really like because they really like it, too, it hits different than when it comes from an algorithm.  Being on air and sharing music is “a way of connection with thousands of people across the world,” says Evie Stokes, DJ and host of KEXP’s Drive Time. “It’s a great way for me to be honest and have accountability and community that I think we so desperately need.” Her connection to the audience is built through and alongside the music; Stokes has shared her journey into sobriety with her listeners. “Every time I talk about it on air… I get an influx of messages from folks who are going through similar paths in their life.” That connection simply can’t exist when the only thing running the station is a robot. One of the downsides of being employed as a writer is that it’s basically impossible for me to listen to the radio while I work. I can’t write to songs with lyrics, and I definitely can’t write while a DJ is talking. So I turn to Spotify a lot during the workday, and I’ve listened to plenty of “lofi” and “smooth jazz beats” playlists while blogging. I’ve used another of Spotify’s AI features, too: AI-created playlists. For the purpose, they’re fine. Best of all, there’s no pretense that a human is picking the music for me. I tell the computer what mood I’m in, and it assembles a playlist of tunes that fit the assignment.  If nothing else, the AI DJ is a kind of totem of the particular AI moment we’re in. Generative AI is buzzy, and tech companies are busy shoving it into every corner of every product they make, whether it has any business being there or not. There’s plenty of stuff AI can do and probably will do for us in the near future. But standing in for a real human, especially in creative applications, isn’t one of them. Take it from the Polish radio station that tried — and failed spectacularly — to replace its human presenters with AI characters.  A podcast is just humans talking to each other Does anyone actually want an AI DJ calling them by name? Does anybody want an AI-generated DM from their favorite creator? Does anyone want to have a Zoom meeting with your AI avatar? Maybe, but I think the tech executives pushing for more of this stuff are vastly overestimating this demand and underestimating the value that a real human brings to an exchange. People want to listen to podcasts, for Christ’s sake. A podcast is just humans talking to each other. Conceptually, listening to a podcast is about as advanced as gathering round the radio for your favorite program like people did a hundred years ago. Some things are constants. On the day I started listening to the Spotify AI DJ, I got in the car that afternoon to pick my kid up from daycare. DJ Riz was hosting Drive Time on KEXP, and the first thing I heard him play was “Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows” by Lesley Gore, released in 1963. It’s a bop that’s as syrupy-sweet as the candy in its title. Riz followed that up with Love from Mos Def’s 1999 album Black on Both Sides. I’m sure I wouldn’t have listened to either of those songs on my own that afternoon, let alone back to back. But it worked, and the juxtaposition made me smile. You just don’t get that kind of thing from AI.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly. The Verge is a vox media network © 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

            "content": "By  Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Has there ever been a presidential election so totally obsessed with the American auto industry?  Sure, past campaigns have made glancing reference to the storied auto sector, mostly as a stand-in for popular tropes like American ingenuity and hard work. But this election feels different. The combination of Michigan, the home of the Big Three automakers (Ford, GM, and Stellantis), as a crucial swing state and the historic shift toward electric vehicles, has put the industry in the red-hot center of an already unpredictable presidential race.   Joe Biden kicked things off early on by making EVs the centerpiece of his administration’s efforts to fight climate change. That included billions of dollars for new charging infrastructure, tax credits for buyers, and billions more for manufacturers looking to build new factories (or retrofit old ones). The president, a self-professed car guy, even got behind the wheel of an electric Ford truck to demonstrate his commitment to these cleaner, less-polluting vehicles. (“That sucker,” the president declared, “is quick.”)  Naturally, this all got distilled and distorted through the right-wing media woodchipper as a government mandate to purchase electric vehicles and a ban on our beloved gas cars. Former President Donald Trump and the Republican apparatus seized on what they saw as trepidation among consumers about EV range and high prices and turned that into a message of government overreach. After all, EVs could be cold and digital, while the pistons firing under the hoods of gas cars had all the patriotic fervor of a firework display.  Trump spent most of the year ridiculing EVs on the campaign trail, claiming they would “kill” the American auto industry and “assassinate” jobs. The United Auto Workers strike over the summer added fuel to the fire, with many workers expressing unease about the shift. Trump declared that the Biden administration “ordered a hit job on Michigan manufacturing” by encouraging the sale of electric cars. (Language that now seems weirdly prescient given the multiple recent attempts on his life.) And he’s promised to reverse Biden’s policies on “day one” if elected in November.  To be sure, the Democrats’ plan was a familiar neoliberal mash-up of tax credits and abatements aimed at getting people who are already well off to spend a little more on an expensive EV in the hopes that sales volume would eventually help cool prices. Republicans could have had a reasonable counter message about excessive spending to help the rich better afford cool cars but instead ended up settling on Trump’s fever dream distortions.  The swift politicization of EVs took many by surprise The swift politicization of EVs took many by surprise, including the people in charge of making them: “I never thought the propulsion system on a vehicle would be [political],” General Motors CEO Mary Barra recently told CBS News Sunday Morning. Ford CEO Jim Farley penned a LinkedIn post about how much he loves EVs and his belief that they should have “nothing to do with politics.”  Of course, it’s naive to think that anything that happens in America in the 21st century can be completely divorced from politics. The type of car you buy has always been a signifier of certain core beliefs. Pickup trucks are Republican-coded, much in the same way the Toyota Prius is often associated with coastal liberals.  Politics has always been ingrained in the car business. The federal government regulates safety, while drivers are licensed by states. But more than that, the government uses its policy-making powers to steer consumers to certain desired outcomes, just as regulations force manufacturers to adopt preferred technologies. And these policies originate from certain beliefs, such as the certainty that climate change is a very real threat and tailpipe pollution is a major contributor. Earlier this year, the Environmental Protection Agency adopted new rules aimed at slashing greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2032. EVs would need to account for over half of new vehicle sales for automakers to meet these strict mandates. Trump claims to believe that people should have the freedom to drive whatever car they want, regardless of the environmental impact. To him, rising sea levels imply more desirable “oceanfront property.” But beliefs are malleable, and politics is fickle. Tesla owners who thought they were making an environmentally conscious choice are now stuck driving totems to Elon Musk’s quixotic turn to the right. And the Tesla CEO’s slavish support for Trump has helped to soften the former president’s stance on EVs. No longer are they stealthy job assassins — now, Trump lauds them as “incredible,” if not for everyone.  The Tesla CEO’s slavish support for Trump has helped to soften the former president’s stance on EVs Polls show that support for EVs splits along party lines. Democrats continue to funnel billions into EV infrastructure, even as sales growth slows and manufacturers suddenly balk at the aggressive stance they themselves took when EVs seemed poised to take over the world. Plug-in hybrids are now the new fad. Trump says that, if elected, no state would be allowed to ban internal combustion engines.  Out on the campaign trail, Vice President Kamala Harris has kept EVs — and indeed the entire Biden climate legacy — at an arm’s length, instead talking about her support for fracking as she attempts to court the must-win state of Pennsylvania. Her shift to the center has left EVs in a bit of a chilly spot.  Harris has been tough to pin down on EVs. She knows that Biden’s embrace didn’t quite pay off for him politically. EVs poll poorly in battleground states, including Michigan. And now that Trump has Musk giddily hopping around onstage for him like a marionette, Trump’s free to ramp up his attacks, pouring money into ads that falsely claim that Harris wants to “end all gas cars.” After weeks of dodging the issue, Harris addressed it head-on in a speech in Flint, Michigan: “Let us be clear,” she said, “contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive.”  Only 3 in 10 Americans said they would consider an EV for their next purchase, and support is dropping, according to the Pew Research Center. Pew cites a familiar set of concerns around charging, range anxiety, and prices. Another recent study says the number of Americans that actually believe EVs are better for the planet than gas-powered cars is also dropping. The US has spent billions of dollars to push EVs, and the needle is barely moving. In May 2024, EVs represented 6.8 percent of overall car sales in the US, down from 8.8 percent of total sales in 2023.   With growth flatlining, Biden’s emphasis on EVs as the key weapon against climate change is looking misplaced, especially when compared to the multi-decade investments that paved the way for China to claim the EV crown. China has cracked the code on cheap EVs, with several models selling for $20,000 or less.  The only country producing EVs is our enemy in a new cold war In the US, the average EV transaction is still north of $50,000. If Chinese EV makers like Geely and BYD are allowed to sell them in the US, industry soothsayers warn it could usher in the end of the Big Three. It’s a paradox: we need EVs to reduce emissions, and they need to be cheap so people can buy them, but the only country producing them is our enemy in a new cold war.  Neither Harris nor Trump seems to have much in the way of solutions to China except more tariffs and more protectionist trade policies. Americans need cheap EVs, and China has plenty to sell. But if there’s anything that Trump, Biden, and Harris can all agree on, it’s that you will never be allowed to buy one.  Weirdly, EVs have sucked up so much airtime, we really have no clue about either candidate’s position on the rest of transportation. If you search their policy platforms online, you won’t find any mention of important issues like infrastructure, aviation, public transit, or urban planning.  But since the past is prologue, we can make some educated guesses. Harris likely supports the Biden administration’s efforts to clean up the transportation network by investing in electrification, while also focusing on walkable cities and environmental justice initiatives. Meanwhile, Trump seems poised to eliminate funding for public transportation and would continue funding highway expansion projects, as outlined in the notorious Project 2025 document. But until we know the result of the election, we won’t know for sure.  What seems certain, though, is that whoever wins will have a huge impact on the next car you buy.    / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Elizabeth Lopatto, a reporter who writes about tech, money, and human behavior. She joined The Verge in 2014 as science editor. Previously, she was a reporter at Bloomberg.  It is my personal belief that no normal person should know the name of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s chair, and yet here I am, about to explain why he’s been an issue in the 2024 presidential election. The man in question is Gary Gensler, an economist who formerly worked at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As SEC chair, he has been on the receiving end of death threats. Former President and current Republican nominee Donald Trump made a campaign promise to “fire Gary Gensler” to the raucous approval of a packed arena at this year’s Bitcoin Conference. Though blockchain enthusiasts have been the most vocal in their displeasure, the controversy around Gensler isn’t limited to them. The Economist has dubbed Gensler “the most controversial man in American finance”; House Democrats and Republicans have expressed “stern displeasure” on Gensler’s crypto approach. You could say he is unpopular. Many industries dislike their regulators. It is arguably the job of the SEC commissioner to be somewhat unpopular! And the cryptocurrency industry’s revulsion for Gensler is unsurprising after a series of SEC enforcements, including against major companies and exchanges. But Gensler himself became a contentious, oddly partisan issue on the level of presidential politics. And the story gets more complicated from there because this is not a cut-and-dried case of a regulator being persecuted by the industry for doing his job. Gensler is also unpopular among his own staff, though not for any reasons that will get thousands of people roaring inside a convention center.  It’s unusual for the SEC to be a hot-button issue — even during the 2008 financial crisis, the SEC chair wasn’t exactly a well-known figure. (The chair at the time was Christopher Cox. Yes, literally who.) But the SEC has become politically heated because Gensler wanted it to be, says Adam Pritchard, a professor of securities law at the University of Michigan. “He wanted to raise the profile of the agency,” says Pritchard, pointing to what he says is “an ambitious rulemaking agenda.” Let’s review some very recent history: Gensler’s time at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the agency that regulates derivatives markets. Gensler was in charge of the CFTC in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, during which he successfully convinced Congress to include, as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, new rules involving swaps (a type of financial derivative that was implicated in the crisis) that put them under the purview of the CFTC. His approach at that agency was described using words such as “hard-charging” and “aggressive.”  Before Dodd-Frank, the CFTC’s oversight was just the $35 trillion futures market; after, it was responsible for the $400 trillion swaps market as well. But taking on new duties also meant a lot of new work. The CFTC had to write a lot of new rules, and real people had to clock in hours to make that happen. On top of that, his enforcement chief filed “a record number of cases” against Wall Street banks. As a result of the speed and confusion with which the CFTC was working, the staff had to issue “130 exemptions or no-action letters,” essentially saying no enforcement action should be taken despite the existence of a new rule. He built up a reputation as a micromanager Under Gensler’s leadership, the CFTC outspent its budget and sometimes had to put employees on unpaid leave. At the same time, he built up a reputation as a micromanager. Gensler “routinely demanded that staff work weekends and holidays,” according to the Partnership for Public Service, which named the CFTC as one of the worst places in government to work while Gensler was at the helm.  Gensler’s management style left much to be desired; it also left the CFTC with a considerable amount of unoccupied real estate. Office space at the CFTC surged by almost 75 percent during his tenure. “Gensler signed leases across the country, assuming he would be able to fill the offices with new staff,” noted Fortune. But the funding for that staff never came, and by 2016, a fifth of the agency’s headquarters in DC remained unoccupied — as did almost a third of the New York office.  The playbook Gensler has been using at the SEC looks similar. Here, too, he’s been known for his hard-driving ethos. His two highest-profile issues, environmental disclosures and crypto, have earned him enemies in the Republican Party.  Under the SEC’s new rules around environmental disclosures, companies are required to disclose risks related to climate change. (Those rules have been paused in the face of an onslaught of lawsuits — part of a larger-scale attack on the regulatory state via the courts.)  “I don’t imagine a lot of voters are up in arms about public companies being forced to disclose the impact their policies have on the environment,” says Marc Fagel, who spent more than a decade at the SEC and who is now a lecturer at Stanford Law School. But because Republicans have been complaining about “ESG,” and “woke Wall Street,” this otherwise anodyne set of rules is now part of the culture wars.   But it’s Gensler’s record on crypto that makes his haters really froth at the mouth.  The division between the CFTC and the SEC is peculiar; in most other countries, there’s just one financial regulator. That division is a crucial part of the crypto story; the industry’s preferred regulator is the CFTC. But in the absence of a congressional mandate, a turf war has ensued, with the SEC filing enforcement actions against Coinbase and Binance, two of the largest exchanges, in 2023, claiming the exchanges allowed users to trade unregistered securities.  The SEC under both Gensler and his predecessor had some significant wins; it litigated or settled almost 200 crypto cases since 2017, Gensler told Barron’s in May. In March, a judge found that the suit against Coinbase could go forward — saying the SEC had sufficiently shown “that Coinbase operates as an exchange, as a broker, and as a clearing agency under the federal securities laws, and, through its Staking Program, engages in the unregistered offer and sale of securities.” Gensler has said outright that crypto is “rife with fraud, scams, bankruptcies and money laundering” Meanwhile, Gensler has said outright that crypto is “rife with fraud, scams, bankruptcies and money laundering” — not in and of itself a controversial opinion but one that maybe comes off a touch more outspoken than the typical federal bureaucrat. Maybe to drive the point home, he’s taken a number of crypto companies to task with enforcement actions, which include but are not limited to lawsuits. This is a sore point for the crypto industry, which has complained that the SEC isn’t making rules, just punishing companies, and doing so without providing clear guidance about how to avoid punishment. When the crypto exchange Coinbase requested that the SEC draft comprehensive rules for the crypto industry, the SEC rejected its petition. Coinbase then filed a legal challenge, saying the SEC’s denial was “arbitrary and capricious,” one of the legal standards for overturning an agency action.  Before I say more, let’s go over that again: one of the biggest crypto exchanges asked for more regulation, and then the regulatory agency in question — run by a man who says crypto is full of scams and frauds — said no. That seems pretty absurd on the face of it. Keep in mind, however, that there’s some weird legal crossfire in the timeline. Coinbase’s suit against the SEC over rulemaking was happening at the same time as the SEC’s suit against Coinbase over unregistered securities. And on top of that, there’s an additional complication: regulation just isn’t what it used to be. “The conservative judiciary has limited rulemaking,” says Fagel, the former SEC staffer. (The Supreme Court kneecapped regulators earlier this summer as part of an ongoing trend toward disempowering federal agencies.) “Yes, the SEC could spend three years concocting an entire regulatory regime for crypto. There would be a lawsuit in an hour.”  “Yes, the SEC could spend three years concocting an entire regulatory regime for crypto. There would be a lawsuit in an hour.” It might be more realistic to think of Coinbase’s suit as not asking for regulation per se, but as asking for regulation that Coinbase likes. Because if Coinbase doesn’t like said regulation, it’ll sue. Meanwhile, the courts have tended to back the SEC when it sues or takes enforcement actions — as opposed to rulemaking or other agency decision-making — so, rationally speaking, it’s just good sense for the SEC to focus on doing the things that judges let them do.  Gensler’s approach would be defensible, except that the SEC hasn’t abandoned rulemaking. In just the first eight months of 2022, the SEC proposed more than twice as many new rules as in 2021, and more than had been proposed annually for the last five years, according to an SEC inspector general report.  “There’s no question that the rulemaking initiatives have come fast and furious since he took over at the SEC,” says Pritchard. That means that the number of challenges to the rules has also spiked. Crafting rules that will withstand challenges is time-intensive, creating a feedback loop of more work for the staff, Pritchard says. This is the part that makes Gensler’s SEC start to look a lot like Gensler’s CFTC, and not in a good way. As a result of the pace of rulemaking, attrition rates at the SEC were the highest in 10 years, the 2022 inspector general report said. Managers told the SEC inspector general that it had been harder to hire people with experience, so the agency was relying on temporary workers, “in some cases with little or no experience in rulemaking.”  According to the SEC union, staff have been leaving “at more than twice the rate prior to Gensler’s arrival, and the pace of departures is continuing to accelerate.” The people who were most likely to leave were the most experienced. The SEC staff has experienced benefit cuts, which the union chalks up to “a series of budget decisions made by Chair Gensler,” who chose to increase spending, betting that Congress would increase the SEC’s budget. “In effect, Chair Gensler wagered with your compensation and benefits, knowing that his staff would suffer the consequences if he lost the bet,” the union told its membership. (Congress did not increase the SEC’s budget, and Gensler did in fact lose this bet.)  The union has also decried Gensler’s “irrational hostility” to remote work, adding that “the union is being forced to litigate issues like this more frequently under Chair Gensler than under any previous SEC Chairman.” Overwork and staff attrition have heavy consequences when you’re the literal government. In March 2024, SEC attorneys were sanctioned by a judge for “gross abuse of power” in a crypto case involving a company called Digital Licensing (or, more familiarly, Debt Box). Following the sanctions, the Salt Lake City offices of the SEC were closed because of “significant attrition” — and while the Debt Box fiasco wasn’t the only reason it closed, it did play a role. Attorney sanctions are relatively rare, and sanctions of government lawyers are even more so.  The SEC chair term lasts five years, meaning Gensler’s time is up in June 2026. But regardless of who is elected, Gensler’s tenure may not continue into the next administration. Gensler has said he would “absolutely” stay for a second term under Biden, when Biden was still the Democratic nominee. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has targeted him specifically, with the former president saying he would “fire” Gensler. Vice President Kamala Harris’ donors have also been pushing to get rid of Gensler. Her exact stance on Gensler as a regulator isn’t clear, but Gensler is closely associated with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and the relationship between Warren and Harris has been tense. Legally, the president can fire SEC chairs — but the chair then becomes a normal SEC commissioner. In that case, they can only be removed for cause, says Anne Joseph O’Connell, a law professor at Stanford Law School. (Typically, though, chairs resign when a new party is elected, while the regular commissioners carry on.) It’s unclear what would happen in the case of a Harris administration — intraparty transitions don’t happen very often. Gensler is a symptom, not the disease It’s funny. There’s reason to think that Gensler is, in fact, bad at his job. But when the crypto industry calls for Gensler to get fired, it’s probably not because it’s concerned about the work-life balance of the SEC staff. The same people who want Gensler’s head on a platter are the least likely people in America to find common cause with the SEC union. And given the polarization in American politics, when Gensler is demonized by the crypto industry (and lumped in with the actually effective Lina Khan by the business class), he comes out looking good to a certain set of half-informed liberals. The real story here is the paralyzed regulatory state. The legislative chambers that could have increased the SEC’s budget and mitigated its problems of too much rulemaking with too little staff are gridlocked. (Maybe Gensler’s chaotic leadership would have rendered that a null effort, but it’s hard to say for sure.) As for the problems with what is sometimes termed “regulation by enforcement,” that’s exactly the incentive structure the right wing has set up by kneecapping agencies’ abilities to set rules. Gensler is a symptom, not the disease. When the SEC makes rules, it gets tied up in court, and so even when the industry wants rules, it’s not going to get them. Strong regulation isn’t nearly as dangerous for corporations as unpredictability is. Go ahead and fire Gensler — who cares? The next SEC chair isn’t going to be able to set predictable guidelines, either.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "The government of Canada ordered TikTok Technology Canada to dissolve on Wednesday, citing national security concerns. TikTok Technology Canada is the business arm of the Chinese company ByteDance in the country. In a weird move, Ottawa did not order a ban on TikTok itself, and citizens will still be allowed to use the app. Canada, like the U.S., has been scrutinizing TikTok for a few years now. The argument is that because ByteDance is a Chinese company it’s beholden to the Chinese Communist Party. The app hoovers up the data of those in the West and makes it available to the Red Chinese. Lawmakers and observers have also argued that ByteDance tweaks the algorithm of TikTok in the West so it makes young people stupid while the Chinese version of the app makes them smart. Those perceptions have led to a string of hearings and legislative battles in the U.S. and Canada. In February of 2023, Ottawa banned TikTok from all government devices and then ordered a national security review of the app. This order to dissolve ByteDance’s Canadian arm is the result of that review. “We came to the conclusion that these activities that were conducted in Canada by TikTok and their offices would be injurious to national security,” Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne told CBC News. What, exactly, did Canada find during its national security review? Champagne said you’d just have to trust him. “I’m not at liberty to go into much detail, but I know Canadians would understand when you’re saying the government of Canada is taking measures to protect national security, that’s serious,” he said. But again, Canada isn’t banning the app outright. Anyone who wants to can still use it. Canada won’t block the app and it won’t stop Canadians from uploading anything to it. “The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,” Champagne said. The order means that ByteDance will have to shut down two of its offices in Toronto and Vancouver. A spokesperson for ByteDance told The Washington Post that the move would cost Canada hundreds of jobs. “We will challenge this order in court. The TikTok platform will remain available for creators to find an audience, explore new interests and for businesses to thrive,” ByteDance said. TikTok isn’t faring well in the U.S. either. In 2020, in the last days of his first presidency, Donald Trump signed a vague executive order that prohibited people from doing business with ByteDance. Trump also said he wanted to see another company, like Microsoft, buy the app. The order was challenged in court. The anti-TikTok sentiment continued during the Biden administration. In 2022, Biden banned TikTok on U.S. government devices. A few days later, he called on ByteDance to sell the app to an American company. Congress has attempted to pass multiple bills banning the app outright. TikTok has repeatedly said it won’t sell its U.S. operations off. Unless TikTok changes its mind, it’s scheduled to go dark on January 19, 2025—just one day before Trump will be sworn into office. The move against TikTok is part of a broader anti-social media sentiment building across the world. Once perceived as a boon to humanity that will connect the world, there’s a growing perception of social media as an illness at the heart of society. Evidence that it’s addictive and makes people miserable is growing. Concerns about TikTok feeding the Chinese Communist Party data are mirrored in concerns that American tech oligarchs like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg do the same with Facebook and X. Social media companies still largely have free reign in the United States, but many other countries are regulating the technology. In the EU, regulators have repeatedly fined and regulated Meta, YouTube, and X citing concerns about disinformation. In Australia, Parliament is set to consider legislation that would ban X, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook for anyone under the age of 16. “Social media is doing harm to our kids and I’m calling time on it,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said when he announced the proposed legislation. \nCanadaChinaSocial mediaTikTok  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Trump seems to have just two options.\n         \n          The why and how of leaving X.

            "content": "A few days before Halloween feels like the perfect moment for this update: that new Scary Movie entry, teased at CinemaCon earlier this year, is officially moving full steam ahead. Even better, the Wayans Brothers, who made the first two Scary Movie horror comedies but were absent for parts three through five, are back for the reboot. This news comes from Deadline, which notes the sixth Scary Movie will be a theatrical release through Miramax and Paramount and will start filming next year. Marlon, Shawn, and Keenan Ivory Wayans—the latter directed the first two Scary Movies; the former both co-wrote and co-starred—told the trade, “We couldn’t be more excited to be a part of the new Scary Movie and work with each other again. This is a franchise we created more than 20 years ago. We remember people laughing in the aisles and hope to see that happen again. We look forward to working with Jonathan Glickman and his team at the new Miramax to bring these laughs to theaters, where they belong. It’s a double reunion.” The most recent Scary Movie was released in 2013; it was a box-office disappointment after an established track record of hits. The 2000 original, which parodied the then-newly popular Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer slasher franchises, is still the top-grosser at over $278 million. Scary Movie 2 followed in 2001, skewering The Exorcist and House on Haunted Hill; Scary Movie 3, an oft-cited fan favorite, took on The Ring and Signs (with a dash of 8 Mile, too). Part four had more M. Night Shyamalan (The Village) and Japanese horror (The Grudge) to mock, along with Saw; part five’s diminishing returns took on Mama, Paranormal Activity, and Black Swan. So far there’s no word on what the new Scary Movie might skewer, but if you look at the past decade-plus of horror releases, there’s so much for the Wayans to riff on, including The Conjuring films, the entire scope of “elevated horror” (Get Out, Hereditary, The Witch), tech terrors (M3GAN is already campy, but imagine a Scary Movie version of her!), the new Universal Monster movies, and maybe even the meta idea of reboots and legacy sequels (The Exorcist, Halloween, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice). In particular, Scream and I Know What You Do Last Summer are active franchises again, so Scary Movie would also have good reason to check in with some old favorites. There’s also no word on who might star in Scary Movie part six, other than (presumably) the Wayans—but we’d love to see an Anna Faris-Regina Hall reunion as part of this new project.

            "content": "A Saudi-backed business school in Switzerland has launched a Doomsday Clock to warn the world about the harms of “uncontrolled artificial general intelligence,” what it calls a “god-like” AI. Imagine if the people selling offices on Excel spreadsheets in the 1980s tried to tell workers that the software was a pathway to birthing a god and used a ticking Rolex to do it and you’ll have an idea of what we’re dealing with here. Michael Wade—the clock’s creator and a TONOMUS Professor of Strategy and Digital at IMD Business School in Lausanne, Switzerland, and Director of the TONOMUS Global Center for Digital and AI Transformation (good lord)—unveiled the clock in a recent op-ed for TIME. A clock ticking down to midnight is a once-powerful and now stale metaphor from the atomic age. It’s an image so old and stayed that it just celebrated its 75th anniversary. After America dropped nukes on Japan, some researchers and scientists who’d worked on developing the weapon formed the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Their project has been to warn the world of its impending destruction. The Doomsday Clock is one of the ways they do it. Every year experts in various fields—from nuclear weapons to climate change to, yes, artificial intelligence—gather and discuss just how screwed the world is. Then they set the clock. The closer to midnight, the closer humanity is to its doom. Right now it’s at 90 seconds to midnight, the closest the clock has ever been set. Wade and IMD have no relation to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and the Doomsday Clock is its own thing. Wade’s creation is the AI Safety Clock. “The Clock’s current reading—29 minutes to midnight—is a measure of just how close we are to the critical tipping point where uncontrolled AGI could bring about existential risks,” he said in his Time article. “While no catastrophic harm has happened yet, the breakneck speed of AI development and the complexities of regulation mean that all stakeholders must stay alert and engaged.” Silicon Valley’s loudest AI proponents love to lean into the nuclear metaphor. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman compared the work of his company to the Manhattan Project. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA) wrote that America’s rush to embrace AI is similar to Oppenheimer’s pursuit of the atomic bomb. Some of this fear and concern might be genuine but it’s all marketing at the end of the day. We’re in the middle of a hype cycle around AI. Companies are promising it can deliver unprecedented returns and destroy labor costs. Machines, they say, will soon do everything for us. The reality is that AI is useful but also mostly moves labor and production costs to other parts of the chain where the end user doesn’t see it. The fear of AI becoming so advanced that it wipes humanity out is just another kind of hype. Doomerism about word calculators and predictive modeling systems is just another way to get people excited about the possibilities of this technology and mask the real harm it creates. At a recent Tesla event, robot bartenders poured drinks for attendees. By all appearances, they were controlled remotely by humans. LLMs burn a ton of water and electricity when coming up with answers and often rely on the subtle and constant attention of human “trainers” who labor in poor countries and work for a pittance. Humans use the tech to flood the internet with non-consensually created nude images of other humans. These are just a few of the real-world harms already caused by Silicon’s rapid embrace of AI. And as long as you’re afraid of Skynet coming to life and wiping out humanity in the future, you aren’t paying attention to the problems right in front of you. The Bulletin’s Doomsday Clock may be inscrutable on the surface, but there’s an army of impressive minds behind the metaphor churning out work every day about the real risks of nuclear weapons and new technologies. In September, the Bulletin put a picture of Altman in an article debunking hyperbolic claims about how AI might be used to engineer new bioweapons. “For all the doomsaying, there are actually many uncertainties in how AI will affect bioweapons and the wider biosecurity arena,” the article said. It also stressed that talk of extreme scenarios around AI helps people avoid having more difficult conversations. “The challenge, as it has been for more than two decades, is to avoid apathy and hyperbole about scientific and technological developments that impact biological disarmament and efforts to keep biological weapons out of the war plans and arsenals of violent actors,” the Bulletin said. “Debates about AI absorb high-level and community attention and … they risk an overly narrow threat focus that loses sight of other risks and opportunities.” There are dozens of articles like this published every year by the people who run the Doomsday Clock. The Swiss AI clock has no such scientific backing, though it claims to be monitoring such articles in its FAQ. What it has, instead, is money from Saudi Arabia. Wade’s position at the school is possible thanks to funding from TONOMUS, a subsidiary of NEOM. NEOM is Saudi Arabia’s much-hyped city of the future that it’s attempting to build in the desert. Among the other promises of NEOM are robot dinosaurs, flying cars, and a giant artificial moon. You’ll forgive me if I don’t take Wade or the AI Safety Clock seriously. \nAiElon Muskmanhattan projectNEOM  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Pitched as a mix of ‘Blade Runner’ and ‘Jurassic Park,’ Neom is the world’s biggest construction project.

            "content": "A Texas federal jury has awarded American Airlines a whopping $9.4 million in a lawsuit filed against Skiplagged.com, a website that helps travelers get cheaper flights by booking flights with a connection and then abandoning the connecting flight to the final destination. The airline industry loathes Skiplagged, even though there’s technically nothing illegal about the practice it’s promoting. Last week, the court awarded $4.7 million from Skiplagged’s revenue based on an estimate of lost fares and another $4.7 million for copyright infringement, as it was scraping American’s flight schedules in violation of the airline’s terms of service.  American also sued over trademark infringement, claiming that Skiplagged was using the American logo on its website to make it appear the site was endorsed by American; the judge disagreed on that one.  As of today, Skiplagged still returns fares and routes from American Airlines. It’s unclear if that will change or how this judgement will impact Skiplagged’s business. We have reached out for comment. Most airlines expressly prohibit skiplagging—effectively an exploit of the airline business model—and use technology to try and detect when customers are doing it. Travelers have reported being banned from certain airlines for years after being caught. The concept of skiplagging—and why airlines hate it—is somewhat complicated to understand. Let’s say you want to travel from Boston to San Francisco, and a search on Google Flights returns one-way trips costing $300. You could instead book a flight from Boston to Sacramento with a layover in San Francisco for $199. In essence, what Skiplagged is doing is revealing this “hidden” itinerary that gets you to San Francisco for $100 less (Skiplagged charges users a small fee, usually $10). All you do is book the flight to Sacramento, and when you land in San Francisco (your actual intended destination), just leave the airport and abandon the connecting flight.  It seems counterintuitive — why would flying to San Francisco and taking another flight to Sacramento be cheaper than just flying to San Francisco? Essentially, major airlines work on a model in which direct flights between every city would not make sense — how many people really want to fly from Boston to Sacramento? So in the interest of efficiency, the airlines use major cities like San Francisco as central connecting hubs for flights to other destinations with less demand. The airline is charging the passenger based on demand to Sacramento, offering a reduced fare to ensure it fills those seats to Sacramento and generates at least some revenue. Airlines also feel they can charge more for direct flights because of the convenience factor for passengers.  But skiplagging messes with the business model. In the case of skiplagging, airlines use algorithms to estimate how many passengers will miss their flight, and then intentionally overbook the flight to generate extra revenue. The airline gets revenue from the person who missed the flight, and additional revenue from someone else who in turn took that seat. When a passenger makes the first leg of a flight, they have to assume that the passenger will also make their connecting flight and cannot overbook that seat. That’s potential revenue left on the table for American Airlines.  It’s hard to feel sympathy for the airlines in this case. Anyone who travels regularly knows how gate agents constantly plead with passengers to change their flight when a plane has been overbooked and too many people show up. The airlines are playing games to maximize revenue and frustrate customers—skiplagging just turns the tables on them, returning some power back to the customer. But a judge decided that American’s terms of service against unauthorized scraping are clear, and Skiplagged decided to violate them anyway. It’s not dissimilar from the way in which AI companies have decided to ignore terms of service agreements to scrape content sites.  Fortunately, you don’t actually need to use Skiplagged to find these fares. If you’re clever enough, you can do it using any other travel booking site like Google Flights or Expedia. Just don’t do it too frequently on the same airline or you may well get caught. And keep in mind that you cannot travel with checked luggage using this method, as your luggage will be sent to the final destination. Traveling light is better anyway.  \nskiplagged  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n      Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Though Redbox, the DVD vending machine company, is officially dead, the company’s disc-dispensing kiosks are still strewn all over America. The machines still work and there are still hundreds of DVDs inside of them. Lately, those machines have been getting sold off to various hardware enthusiasts who have, in turn, been reverse-engineering them to figure out how they work, and to dispense the movies trapped inside. Well, with one exception: Twister. 404 Media reports that, for some weird reason, the army of amateur hardware enthusiasts who have been futzing with the company’s machines cannot figure out how to get the 1996 disaster flick out of them. To illuminate this bizarre conundrum, 404 cites a series of Reddit threads and Discord communities where the hardware pros have been posting about the issue. “Sorry, there was a problem with the purchased items in your cart. Please remove these items from your cart in order to continue,” an alert from the kiosk reads, whenever someone tries to rent Twister. This issue impacts “seemingly every Redbox kiosk and is not happening with any other movie,” the outlet writes. 404 Media writes that the machine’s refusal to dispense Twister “appears to be either a licensing dispute or software bug.” The outlet further states that one of the prevailing theories is that “Redbox’s licensing agreement for Twister ran out ahead of the release of its sequel, Twisters, and there is a hard-coded date where checking out with Twister in your cart was disabled.” That said, 404 notes nobody has been able to confirm this. Redbox swept onto the video rental scene in the early aughts, not long before the industry’s mom-and-pop store paradigm would be disrupted by the advent of Netflix and video streaming. Originally an offshoot of McDonald’s, the company expanded aggressively in the years after its founding. At one point, Redbox surpassed Blockbuster as the largest video rental retailer in the country. Now, of course, that’s all over, thanks to the dominance of streaming. Two years ago, a subsidiary of the company that publishes the Chicken Soup for the Soul self-help book series bought Redbox. Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment took on $325 million in debt when it acquired the company, with the plan of reinventing the ailing business. Instead, the company wracked up an enormous amounts of debt and was forced to file for bankruptcy this past August. As part of the bankruptcy deal, Redbox had to be liquidated. The Verge reports that when Chicken Soup filed for bankruptcy this summer, it had been “sued over a dozen times over unpaid bills.” \nRedboxtwister  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Hackers reveal the old Redbox kiosks can be easily hacked for users' names and some financial info.

This latest version of Microsoft’s renowned productivity suite is available for a limited time at $179, a significant $70 discount from its regular price of $249. See at StackSocial Office 2024 Home & Business represents a substantial update to the popular software package which hasn’t seen a major revision since 2021. This release is particularly noteworthy as Microsoft has been primarily focused on promoting its subscription-based Microsoft 365 service in recent years. However, for those who prefer a one-time purchase over a recurring subscription, Microsoft Office 2024 Home & Business offers is a great alternative. The package includes the latest versions of essential productivity applications: Word for document creation, Excel for spreadsheets and data analysis, PowerPoint for presentations, Outlook for email and calendar management and OneNote for note-taking and organization. These are full-featured desktop applications compatible with Windows 11, Windows 10, and macOS. One of the key advantages of this offer is that it provides a lifetime license for a single PC or Mac. This means users can enjoy the software indefinitely without the need for annual renewals or monthly payments. In the long run, this can prove to be significantly more cost-effective than subscribing to Microsoft 365, especially for users who don’t require the additional cloud-based features and regular updates offered by the subscription model. This deal for Office 2024 Home & Business should not be confused with the more basic Office Home 2024 which is priced at $149 but only includes Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The Home & Business edition provides considerably more value with the addition of Outlook and OneNote which makes it a more comprehensive solution for both personal and professional use. The software also comes with access to Microsoft support resources so that users can get assistance if they encounter any issues. Additionally, while it’s not a cloud-based service like Microsoft 365, Office 2024 Home & Business is designed to work seamlessly with Microsoft Teams and facilitates collaboration in today’s increasingly remote work environments. For sure, this StackSocial deal on Microsoft Office 2024 Home & Business is a great opportunity for individuals and small businesses looking to upgrade their productivity tools without committing to a subscription model. At $179 instead of $249, it offers substantial savings on a powerful, up-to-date software suite that will serve users well for the foreseeable future.

            "content": "A former researcher at the OpenAI has come out against the company’s business model, writing, in a personal blog, that he believes the company is not complying with U.S. copyright law. That makes him one of a growing chorus of voices that sees the tech giant’s data-hoovering business as based on shaky (if not plainly illegitimate) legal ground. “If you believe what I believe, you have to just leave the company,” Suchir Balaji recently told the New York Times. Balaji, a 25-year-old UC Berkeley graduate who joined OpenAI in 2020 and went on to work on GPT-4, said he originally became interested in pursuing a career in the AI industry because he felt the technology could “be used to solve unsolvable problems, like curing diseases and stopping aging.” Balaji worked for OpenAI for four years before leaving the company this summer. Now, Balaji says he sees the technology being used for things he doesn’t agree with, and believes that AI companies are “destroying the commercial viability of the individuals, businesses and internet services that created the digital data used to train these A.I. systems,” the Times writes. This week, Balaji posted an essay on his personal website, in which he argued that OpenAI was breaking copyright law. In the essay, he attempted to show “how much copyrighted information” from an AI system’s training dataset ultimately “makes its way to the outputs of a model.“ Balaji’s conclusion from his analysis was that ChatGPT’s output does not meet the standard for “fair use,” the legal standard that allows the limited use of copyrighted material without the copyright holder’s permission. “The only way out of all this is regulation,” Balaji later told the Times, in reference to the legal issues created by AI’s business model. Gizmodo reached out to OpenAI for comment. In a statement provided to the Times, the tech company offered the following rebuttal to Balaji’s criticism: “We build our A.I. models using publicly available data, in a manner protected by fair use and related principles, and supported by longstanding and widely accepted legal precedents. We view this principle as fair to creators, necessary for innovators, and critical for US competitiveness.” It should be noted that the New York Times is currently suing OpenAI for unlicensed use of its copyrighted material. The Times claimed that the company and its partner, Microsoft, had used millions of news articles from the newspaper to train its algorithm, which has since sought to compete for the same market. The newspaper is not alone. OpenAI is currently being sued by a broad variety of celebrities, artists, authors, and coders, all of whom claim to have had their work ripped off by the company’s data-hoovering algorithms. Other well-known folks/organizations who have sued OpenAI include Sarah Silverman, Ta-Nahisi Coates, George R. R. Martin, Jonathan Franzen, John Grisham, the Center for Investigative Reporting, The Intercept, a variety of newspapers (including The Denver Post and the Chicago Tribune), and a variety of YouTubers, among others. Despite a mixture of confusion and disinterest from the general public, the list of people who have come out to criticize the AI industry’s business model continues to grow. Celebrities, tech ethicists, and legal experts are all skeptical of an industry that continues to grow in power and influence while introducing troublesome new legal and social dilemmas to the world. \nArtificial intelligenceOpenAISam Altman  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          After seeing its stock fall 99%, there are doubts the online education company will be able to pay its debts.\n         \n          Identifying when animals are in pain is good for moral reasons, of course, but also for maximizing their productivity.\n         \n          OpenAI is going through a rough patch and it's Elon's turn to take revenge.\n         \n          A judge found that two media outlets alleging copyright violations hadn't demonstrated that they'd been harmed by OpenAI removing \"copyright management information\" from its training data.\n         \n          Conversational search will understand memory and context so you can talk to it like a person.\n         \n          Notepad is getting AI features that Microsoft claims will help you improve your writing.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

He’s one of those stars who seems to be always working, and to hear him tell it, that’s because he put the work in to become a reliable actor. Business Insider recently did a spotlight on Lillard, wherein he reminisced about the arc of his career. After breaking out in the ’90s, he became “caught up in this drive of trying to be ‘famous,’ and the success of what I was doing.” The critical and financial failure of Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed had him thinking he’d “never work again,” and later an offer to appear on Dancing With the Stars, made him realize he “really just wanted to be a great actor.” So he decided to reset his life by looking at non-acting ventures (like his liquor business) and teaching acting while taking on roles that he ffelt would best suit him as a performer. When he wasn’t voicing Shaggy in Scooby media, he spent the last decade in supporting roles on Good Girls, Twin Peaks, and Halt and Catch Fire. But it was last year’s Blumhouse hit Five Nights at Freddy’s that’s put bigger eyes on him, particularly with younger audiences. Lillard admitted to Business Insider that he wasn’t entirely sure what to make of his role as William Afton at first, since the original scripts only gave him about “two lines.” He called it a “leap of faith” role, and it was only after director Emma Tammi told him that Afton would be more central in a planned trilogy that he really got the picture. He, along with leading man Josh Hutcherson, are both returning for the sequel coming out in December 2025. Beyond that, Lillard will also appear in next year’s Life of Chuck from Mike Flanagan. But what about Scream, which has brought back surviving characters (and some not) for its newer sequels? He reiterated to Business Insider that he’d be fine to return if the conversation arose, and separately told GamesRadar the franchise is in a “really good place.” His feelings on the violence aside—to him, Ghostface shouldn’t have had a shotgun in Scream 6—he said he hopes director Kevin Williamson (who wrote the first and fourth movies) takes Scream 7 “in a brand new, brave, and exciting direction so that we can sort of find different colors and different joys.” Want more io9 news?

            "content": "In August, the Federal Trade Commission announced a ban on writing, buying, or selling fake reviews online. Under the new rule, anyone who participates in a fake online review could be fined up to $51,744. The commissioners voted in agreement and it’s now in effect. This mandate includes AI-generated reviews (which have recently invaded Amazon) and also encompasses dishonest celebrity endorsements as well as testimonials posted by a company’s employees, relatives, or friends, unless they include an explicit disclaimer. The rule also prohibits brands from offering any sort of incentive to prompt such an action. Suppressing negative reviews is no longer allowed, nor is promoting reviews that a company knows or should know are fake. Phony online reviews are harmful not just because they mislead consumers but because they create unfair competition. FTC Chair Lina M. Khan said in a statement: “By strengthening the FTC’s toolkit to fight deceptive advertising, the final rule will protect Americans from getting cheated, put businesses that unlawfully game the system on notice, and promote markets that are fair, honest, and competitive.” Recent developments point toward the fake reviews problem finally being taken seriously. Just last month, Google updated its review restrictions document with new business profile restrictions for policy violations. It stated that any Google Maps business profile caught with a fake review will be unable to receive new reviews for a given period, have its existing reviews or ratings unable to be published for a specific time period, and have the page show a warning message to users informing them about non-compliant reviews having been removed. Browsers have also experimented with solutions by offering proprietary services to weed out fake online reviews. Last October, Firefox began testing a new tool, Review Checker, powered by Firefox-acquired Fakespot, that is supposed to automatically filter out misleading reviews and counterfeit products as you shop. The tool is now available as a built-in shopping feature on the browser. \nFTC  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The farm equipment giant has fought against letting farmers repair their own equipment for years.\n         \n          If she wins in November, there are indicators that Harris will keep the controversial FTC head, a new report claims.\n         \n          Subscription providers will be required to inform customers what they're signing up for, obtain customer consent, and provide clear mechanisms to cancel.\n         \n          A scathing new report takes aim directly at Big Tech and alleged violations of privacy.\n         \n          1Health.io left its customers genetic information unsecured in unencrypted and publicly accessible AWS servers.\n         \n          The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is calling this a victory as it holds back the American worker.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Companies will soon have to make it as easy to cancel a subscription as they made it to sign up for one under a new Federal Trade Commission rule aimed at ending predatory business practices that lock consumers into paying for services they don’t want. If you sign up for an account online, the company must provide a simple way to cancel the subscription online. If you sign up in person, you must be allowed to cancel in person or over the phone. Additionally, the rule requires companies to provide clear and truthful information to subscribers about what they’re signing up for and obtain consent before enrolling them in a negative option feature, which is a subscription model in which the customer is signed up for a service and continuously charged unless they take additional—often hidden—steps to reject the subscription. “Too often, businesses make people jump through endless hoops just to cancel a subscription,” FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement. “The FTC’s rule will end these tricks and traps, saving Americans time and money. Nobody should be stuck paying for a service they no longer want.” The FTC approved the new rule on a 3-2 vote. Several provisions were removed from the agency’s earlier drafts of the rule, including a requirement that sellers remind customers of their ability to opt out of a subscription annually and a requirement that sellers obtain customers’ consent before offering them additional deals in order to entice them to stay in a subscription. Most of the new rule’s provisions will take effect 180 days after it is published in the Federal Register. Business groups seeking to kill the new rule had argued that they receive very few complaints from customers who are unable to cancel their subscriptions and that adding a simple click-to-cancel feature to websites would lead to customers accidentally canceling services they wanted. But in its announcement of the new rule, the FTC said the number of complaints it receives about difficult-to-cancel subscriptions has been on the rise, from an average of 42 per day in 2021 up to 70 per day in 2024. Over the past several years, the agency has also sued several prominent tech companies for operating predatory subscription services. It alleged Amazon “duped” millions of people into enrolling in Amazon Prime and then used dark patterns to make it difficult to cancel those subscriptions. The FTC also accused Adobe of making it difficult to cancel its services and hiding information about early termination fees that it charged customers when they did cancel. \nDark PatternsFTCLina Khan  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The FTC's ban on writing, buying, or selling fake reviews is officially in effect.\n         \n          The farm equipment giant has fought against letting farmers repair their own equipment for years.\n         \n          If she wins in November, there are indicators that Harris will keep the controversial FTC head, a new report claims.\n         \n          A scathing new report takes aim directly at Big Tech and alleged violations of privacy.\n         \n          1Health.io left its customers genetic information unsecured in unencrypted and publicly accessible AWS servers.\n         \n          The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is calling this a victory as it holds back the American worker.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "If you haven’t changed the password on your Ticketmaster account recently, you probably want to. The online ticket sales company is continuing to deal with the fallout from a data breach earlier this year affecting over 500 million customers, and customers are taking the brunt of impact. Business Insider reported yesterday about a string customers checking their emails only to discover that someone had broken into their Ticketmaster accounts and transferred their tickets away: In September, Vashti-Jasmine McKenzie noticed an event had mysteriously vanished from her Google Calendar. It was a reminder for an Usher concert in Dallas on October 5, synced with her Ticketmaster account. McKenzie opened her email to a shock: The night before, a stranger had broken into her account, accessed McKenzie’s two tickets, which she had paid $550 for, and transferred them out of her account. McKenzie was eventually able to get her tickets returned to her by Ticketmaster’s customer support. Others haven’t been so lucky: Business Insider identified another individual who had their tickets stolen, returned to them by Ticketmaster, only to visit their concert and encounter two individuals who discovered their tickets had been swiped only once they got to the gate. Reddit, similarly, is home to many complaints from users saying similar things had happened to them. Ticket scalping is big business these days, and so it’s no surprise that Ticketmaster accounts are of high value. It’s unclear how exactly customer accounts are being accessed—following Ticketmaster’s breach, security experts said that it didn’t appear passwords had been compromised. And you would think any tech company today uses hashing rather than storing passwords in plaintext. Either way, hackers seemingly have been able to run wild through Ticketmaster accounts, adding even more headache to a rough few years for the company. Live Nation, Ticketmaster’s parent company, was sued in May by the Department of Justice for antitrust, with the agency alleging the ticketing giant is behaving anti-competitively by requiring performers use Ticketmaster at venues it operates. Besides handling ticketing through Ticketmaster, Live Nation handles promotions for most major concert venues in the U.S., and also operates hundreds of venues on its own. Basically it offers the whole soup to nuts package. It’s not just the Justice Department mad at Live Nation and Ticketmaster. Concertgoers have been frustrated with the companies for years over the poor handling of ticket sales, including using frustration virtual lines and “dynamic pricing” to jack up the prices of in-demand tickets. It’s gotten to the point that some have been put off from even going to concerts at all if they have to deal with Ticketmaster—which is most of the time. The argument against these companies is that, because they control ticketing for nearly 70% of major concert venues in the U.S., they do not have incentive to improve, and have used their control to gouge venues and artists. In 2023, a Senate Judiciary Committee investigation concluded that Ticketmaster’s exclusive contracts create significant barriers to entry for competitors. Licensing, permits, and other regulatory barriers favor players like Live Nation and Ticketmaster that can handle the costs. From an NPR article written at the time: Klobuchar sees three main issues with Ticketmaster, as she explained in both the interview and her opening statement at the hearing: It controls more than 70% of the market for ticketing and live events, it controls much of the promotion of those events, and it either owns or has yearslong exclusive contracts with many large venues. Live Nation was permitted to acquire Ticketmaster back in 2010 after signing a consent decree saying, among other things, it would not retaliate against venues that chose other ticketing providers, meaning they can still promote through Live Nation. But again, Live Nation controls a vast swath of major venues, where it requires the use of Ticketmaster. Live Nation for its part, has argued that it’s operating in a free market, pointing to competitors like AXS and SeatGeek, and says that its scale has allowed it to offer better technology and lower prices to consumers. Its market share has declined somewhat since 2010 and its prices are comparable to to other ticket marketplaces, it has said. However things play out going forward, especially under another Trump administration, today the reality is that Ticketmaster is still dominant, so if you have to use it, we recommend changing your password, enabling two-factor authentication, and turning on account alerts for any attempted ticket transfers. \nHacksticketmaster  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Hackers made off with the info of 31 million users.\n         \n          The highly anticipated reunion tour started selling tickets over the weekend.

            "content": "Democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib recently sent a letter to Kroger over the grocery giant’s purported plan to introduce digital price tags that could be changed in an instant to raise or lower prices for shoppers based on the time of day, the weather, or any other number of factors. But one particular detail in Kroger’s plan is raising the most eyebrows: The company intends to put cameras in stores that would be used for facial recognition. News leaked over the summer that grocery giant Kroger was partnering with Microsoft to use electronic shelf labels, shortened in the grocery industry as ESLs, as part of an AI push to institute dynamic pricing at its grocery stores. The plan also includes so-called Enhanced Display for Grocery Environment (EDGE) shelf displays that would reportedly include cameras to capture customer information, including images of faces to better tailor ads. But Rep. Tlaib, whose home state of Michigan has 120 Kroger locations, expressed concern about these technologies in her letter dated Oct. 11 and shared Tuesday for the first time publicly. “Studies have shown that facial recognition technology is flawed and can lead to discrimination in predominantly Black and brown communities,” Tlaib said in her letter. “The racial biases of facial recognition technology are well-documented and should not be extended into our grocery stores.” Kroger is the largest grocery store chain in the U.S. by revenue and owns a number of different brands, including Ralphs, Fred Meyer, Pick’n Save, Food 4 Less, and Dillions, among a host of others. Tlaib is worried that ESLs will allow Kroger’s stores to “use customer data to build personalized profiles of each customer” in such a way that it will be able to “determine the maximum price of goods customers are willing to pay.” The plan for dynamic pricing and highly individualized advertising has drawn comparisons to the 2002 futuristic sci-fi movie Minority Report, in which Tom Cruise’s character gets served ads targeting someone with a Japanese surname because he’s been implanted with another man’s eyes. Kroger told Gizmodo in an emailed statement on Wednesday that the company’s business model “is built on a foundation of lowering prices to attract more customers,” claiming that “customers are shopping more with Kroger now than ever because we are fighting inflation and providing great value.” But Kroger didn’t agree with claims that ESLs would be used to raise prices. “To be clear, Kroger does not and has never engaged in ‘surge pricing.’ Any test of electronic shelf tags is designed to lower prices for more customers where it matters most. To suggest otherwise is not true,” the statement continued. That quote is identical to a statement CNN received from an unnamed Kroger spokesperson defending the technology in August. Tlaib’s letter isn’t the first from lawmakers expressing concern about facial recognition. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bob Casey, both Democrats, sent a letter to Kroger back in August asking questions about the company’s plans. As the lawmakers phrased it, facial recognition could be used to “exploit sensitive customer data.” The letter from Warren and Casey noted that analysts are worried dynamic pricing for grocery stores means food could soon be priced like airline tickets, creating a sense of urgency and scarcity that wouldn’t otherwise exist with static prices. It’s unclear whether Warren and Casey have received satisfactory answers to their lists of questions. Kroger is under increased scrutiny over the company’s $24.6 billion merger with Albertson’s, which is currently making its way through state courts in Washington and Colorado over anti-trust concerns. Two Kroger executives took the stand in Denver District Court on Tuesday arguing that it needs to acquire Albertson’s as a way to compete against Walmart’s grocery business, according to the Denver Post. The FTC has also challenged the merger, arguing that it would reduce competition and raise prices for consumers. \nAdvertisingdynamic pricingFoodgroceryKrogersurge pricingtargeted ads  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Vegetable breeders at Oregon State University have produced two new habanero peppers that they say pack all the flavor without the heat.\n         \n          \"I think this was orchestrated by deep state Harris supporters after Trump’s visit to McDonald’s,\" one Trump supporter wrote.\n         \n          USDA didn't have a list of products for consumers to avoid during the initial recall of 10 million pounds of chicken last week.\n         \n          The CDC warns it can take 10 weeks for some people to develop symptoms from listeria.\n         \n          Would you want to drive a truck that was constantly listening to you?\n         \n          It looks like a huge amount of advertisers are considering pulling out of Musk's site in 2025.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": " After the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in July, the merchandise started showing up on Facebook. Trump, fist in the air, face bloodied from a bullet, appeared on everything. Coffee mugs. Hawaiian shirts. Trading cards. Commemorative coins. Heart ornaments. Ads for these products used images captured at the scene by Doug Mills for the New York Times and Evan Vucci for the Associated Press, showing Trump yelling “fight” after the shooting. The Trump campaign itself even offered some gear commemorating his survival. As the Secret Service drew scrutiny and law enforcement searched for a motive, online advertisers saw a business opportunity in the moment, pumping out Facebook ads to supporters hungry for merch. In the 10 weeks after the shooting, advertisers paid Meta between $593,000 and $813,000 for political ads that explicitly mentioned the assassination attempt, according to The Markup’s analysis. (Meta provides only estimates of spending and reach for ads in its database.) Even Facebook itself has acknowledged that polarizing content and misinformation on its platform has incited real-life violence. An analysis by CalMatters and The Markup found that the reverse is also true: real-world violence can sometimes open new revenue opportunities for Meta. While the spending on assassination ads represents a sliver of Meta’s $100 billion-plus ad revenue, the company also builds its bottom line when tragedies like war and mass shootings occur, in the United States and beyond. After the October 7th attack on Israel last year and the country’s response in Gaza, Meta saw a major increase in dollars spent related to the conflict, according to our review. Tech advocacy groups and others question whether Facebook should even profit from violence and whether its ability to do so violates the company’s own principles of not calling for violence. The company said advertisers often respond to current events and that ads that run on its platform are reviewed and must meet the company’s standards. If you count all of the political ads mentioning Israel since the attack through the last week of September, organizations and individuals paid Meta between $14.8 and $22.1 million dollars for ads seen between 1.5 billion and 1.7 billion times on Meta’s platforms. Meta made much less for ads mentioning Israel during the same period the year before: between $2.4 and $4 million dollars for ads that were seen between 373 million and 445 million times.  At the high end of Meta’s estimates, this was a 450 percent increase in Israel-related ad dollars for the company. (In our analysis, we converted foreign currency purchases to current U.S. dollars.) The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a lobbying group that promotes Israel, was the major spender on ads mentioning Israel. In the six months after October 7th, its spending increased more than 300 percent over the previous six months, to between $1.8 and $2.7 million dollars, as the organization peppered Facebook and Instagram with ads defending Israel’s actions in Gaza and pressuring politicians to support the country. As the war has roiled the region, AIPAC paid Meta about as much for ads in the 15 weeks following October 7th as the entire year before. “Our effort is directed to encouraging pro-Israel Americans to stand with our democratic ally as it battles Iranian proxies in the aftermath of the barbaric Hamas attack of October 7th,” Marshall Wittmann, a spokesperson for AIPAC, said in an emailed statement. Other ad campaigns mentioning Israel supported different sides of the conflict. Doctors Without Borders, for example, used advertising to highlight the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Other ads defended and promoted Israel. The Christian Broadcasting Network tied the October 7th attack to a claim in an ad that Iran’s “final, deadly goal” was “to establish a modern caliphate—an Islamic-founded, tyrannical government—across the world.” Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, takes in the vast majority of its revenue from targeted advertising. The company tracks users online to profile their habits and, when a business or organization wants to reach them, lets those businesses pay to send ads to people who might be interested. Those ads might be tied to something perfectly wholesome, like gardening. But the company’s algorithms don’t distinguish between simple hobbies and something darker. Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton said in an emailed statement that Meta did not ultimately profit from political violence, as advertisers broadly back away from advertising during times of strife for fear their ads will be promoted alongside news of the violence. Clayton noted Meta’s chief financial officer recently said on an earnings call that it is “hard for us to attribute demand softness directly to any specific geopolitical event” but had seen lower ad spending “correlating with the start of the conflict” in the Middle East, and had seen similar at the start of the war in Ukraine. “Advertisers responding to current events are nothing new, and it’s seen across the media landscape, including on television, radio, and online news outlets,” Clayton said. “All ads that run on our platform must go through a review process and adhere to our advertising and community standards, and Meta offers an extra layer of transparency by making them publicly available in our Ad Library.” CalMatters and The Markup used Meta’s own tools to calculate how much Meta makes from spikes in advertising when instances of political violence happen, reviewing thousands of ads through both manual review and with the assistance of an AI model offered by Meta itself. (We also made improvements to Meta Research’s scripts for accessing the Ad Library API, and we’re sharing our changes.) To examine the assassination attempt merchandise, we ran a simple search of Meta’s Ad Library for ads that mentioned “assassination,” including any in our analysis that also mentioned “Trump” and hundreds of others that didn’t mention the former president by name but were clearly related to the shooting. “First they jail him, now they try to end him,” one ad read. A conspiratorial ad for a commemorative two-dollar bill claimed “the assassination attempt was their Plan B,” while “Plan A was to make Biden abandon the presidential campaign.” Some ads used clips from the film JFK to suggest an unseen, malevolent force was at work in the shooting. Gun advocates paid for ads, using the assassination attempt as a foreboding call to action. One ad promoting a firearms safety course noted that “November is fast approaching.” A clothing business said in an ad that, since “the government can’t save you” from foreign enemies, Americans “need to be self-reliant, self-made, and self-sufficient.” “Because when those bullets zip by, you are clearly on your own,” the ad read. Most of those ads did not appear to violate Meta’s policies, although some may have broken its ban against showing weapons while alleging “election-related corruption.” But even the ones that didn’t clearly violate Meta’s rules still place the company in an uncomfortable position, as the business takes in advertising dollars from posts tied to grim news cycles. CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself commented on the first Trump assassination attempt, saying in an interview that it was “one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen in my life.” Trump has now survived a second apparent assassination attempt, and Zuckerburg’s company has made millions of dollars through political advertising tied to these and other violent acts. Katie Paul, director of the Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit advocacy organization, said “it’s not a surprise” that ads around political violence would pop up after incidents “if Meta is not making any effort even on a good day to effectively enforce their policies.” “There’s huge problems with their advertising broadly,” she said. “They’re profiting off of a lot of harmful things, really without any sort of repercussions.” Many businesses paying for the assassination ads sold pro-Trump gear before the shooting — and some might have spent a similar amount on ads if the shooting never happened. But for some, the assassination attempt effectively became an entire business strategy, according to the review of Meta advertising data. A clothing company called Red First, which offers everything from customized shirts for pet owners to flags saying “Hillary belongs in prison,” offered assassination-related merchandise through a network of pages with names like 50 Stars Nation and Red White and Blue Zone. The company, which operates in California and Vietnam, according to Meta’s required disclosures, has spent more than $1.8 million since February 2023 to promote ads through its various pages. But in the wake of the shooting, the company pivoted to merchandise around the event. Red First’s ads were relatively innocuous compared to some that sprang up after the shooting – they promoted Trump, not the shooting, and not the idea of retaliation for it. One shirt showed an illustration of Trump, middle fingers in the air, and the words “you missed bigly.” The company has also offered Kamala Harris merchandise, recently launching a page dedicated to it as well. But the ads related to the shooting simultaneously sold products, promoted Trump, and let Meta reap advertising cash from the incident. Many of the thousands of ads posted by the company didn’t explicitly use the word “assassination,” but clearly referenced the event in other ways, using slogans like “he will overcome,” “fight fight fight,” “legends never die,” and “shooting makes me stronger.” To suss out which ads were related to the shooting, we reviewed more than 4,200 ads from the company’s different pages with the assistance of a large language model named Llama, a Meta AI model. We programmed the model to evaluate the text of each ad to determine whether it was related to the assassination attempt, then manually reviewed hundreds of its classifications to ensure it was working as expected. After our review, we determined that more than 2,600 of those more than 4,200 ads were related to the assassination attempt. The total Red First paid to Meta in the 10 weeks after the shooting for those ads: between $473,000 and $798,000. Red First lists a phone number and street address in Southern California, but didn’t respond to phone or email, and the listed address is for a mail-opening service. The advocacy organization the Tech Transparency Project has charted how the National Rifle Association has paid to promote pro-gun views on Meta and Google’s ad platforms after mass shootings. Despite calls from tech company executives for gun control, those companies profit from NRA spending that spikes after shootings, the group has pointed out. After the mass school shooting in Parkland, Fla., the NRA increased its spending on Google and Facebook ads, the Tech Transparency Project noted in one report. In 2018, the year of the shooting, Meta received “more than $2 million in advertising fees from the NRA starting in May of that year,” the report found, which also found that “NRA ad spending reached its highest levels on Google and soared on Facebook” following a week of mass shootings the following year that left dozens of people dead. Just days before the January 6th insurrection, the Tech Transparency Project found that Meta hosted ads offering gun holsters and rifle accessories in far-right Facebook groups. Internationally, Meta has often lapsed in its pledge to keep violent content off its platforms. Meta’s ad policies forbid calling for violence. But when faced with crucial tests of its content moderation practices, the company has repeatedly failed to detect and remove inflammatory ads. A 2018 report, commissioned by Facebook itself, found that its platform had been used to incite violence in Myanmar, and that the company hadn’t done enough to prevent it. Alia Al Ghussain, a researcher on technology issues at Amnesty International, said that as troubling as some ads might be in English, ads in other languages may be even more likely to pass Meta’s content moderation. “In most of the non-English-speaking world, Facebook doesn’t have the resources that it needs to moderate the content on the platform effectively and safely,” she said. Despite later admitting responsibility for violence in Myanmar, the company continues to be faulted for gaps in its international moderation work. Another advocacy organization found in a test that the company approved calls for the murder of ethnic groups in Ethiopia. More recently, a similar test by an advocacy organization found that ads explicitly calling for violence against Palestinians—a flagrant violation of Meta’s rules—were still approved to run by the company. “If ads which are presenting a risk of stoking tension or spreading misinformation are being approved in the US, in English, it really makes me fearful for what is happening in other countries in non-English-speaking languages,” Al Ghussain said.

            "content": "Proponents of the “Network State” seek to create privately owned, anarcho-capitalist, “autonomous” cities—the likes of which will be the urban planning equivalent of what cryptocurrency did to money. The endgame of this bizarre tech-fueled ideological movement is basically a high-tech version of Galt’s Gulch, the utopian libertarian society in Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged that rich nerds have long lusted after. One of the more prominent developments connected to it is a proposed new city dubbed “Praxis.” Dryden Brown, the 28-year-old founder and CEO behind the project, recently said that the urban development plan was an effort to “create a more heroic, more interesting place than anything we’ve seen”—whatever that means. Brown hopes to eventually create his new city in the Caribbean, though he hasn’t revealed a specific location yet and the details of the project have been kept under wraps. This week, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Praxis project had attained $525 million in new funding. A big part of that funding—$500 million—comes from crypto investment firm GEM Digital. The money from GEM is being offered as part a “drawdown financing facility,” a type of loan wherein capital is dispersed only after certain conditions are met by both parties. As part of this business arrangement, GEM will get crypto tokens from Praxis that amount to some approximation of ownership in the deal. In turn, money from the drawdown will be released to Praxis after it lists those crypto tokens on a public crypto exchange, the Journal reports. Praxis also recently secured another $25 million from financial lender Arch Lending, the paper writes. Despite now having access to hundreds of millions of dollars, it should be noted that Praxis is still basically just an idea. And it’s an idea being championed by an Ayn-Rand-loving guy (Brown) who, by his own admission (as reported by the New York Times), dropped out of college, somehow landed a job as a hedge fund analyst, was fired from said hedge fund, and then, at some point in his mid-twenties, decided that his life’s mission should be to build a new city. Despite having a limited list of accomplishments to his name, Brown seems to have lived a fairly charmed life that has involved parties, travel, hobnobbing with the 1 percent, and business deals of a vague and colorful nature. That would seem to make him a relatively good fit for the “Network State” movement, which is full of people who have big dreams but don’t seem tethered particularly tightly to reality. For instance, another advocate for the movement is Balaji Srinivasan, the former chief technology officer of Coinbase, who recently started his own school, the likes of which is dedicated to teaching people about the tenets of the Network State philosophy. “California Forever,” the quixotic effort to create a new, privately owned city on thousands of acres of Bay Area farmland, has also been accused of being part of the movement. The “Network State” worldview is obsessed with cryptocurrency and sees speculative digital assets as the key to the weird high-tech future it wants to see manifest. Such virulent, closely held beliefs lead to utopia-flecked sentences, culled from the Praxis website, like this one: “The next wave of crypto adoption, on the path to crypto civilization, requires crypto infrastructure’s integration into the core functions of society.” Or this one: “Large aligned communities in Network States will use on-chain infrastructure to power their payments, contracts, identity, communications, and physical infrastructure.” As you can see, we are dealing with a rare breed of political fanaticism here. This would be more funny than scary were it not for the fact that the people backing this movement have so much money that they have effectively begun to hijack the U.S. political system. The crypto industry has poured money into this election cycle, accounting for nearly half of the total corporate cash spent on political action committees this year. With that kind of dough, the crypto industry has sought to underwrite the U.S. presidential election (with ample cash thrown at its favored candidate, Donald Trump), while also taking aim at its political enemies—namely, Democrats, but they’re slowly moving to the other side. \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n      Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "It’s been a wild few days for tech billionaire Elon Musk. On Wednesday, the Justice Department warned him that his $1 million giveaway to swing state voters might be illegal. And then on Thursday The Wall Street Journal broke the news that Musk has been having private conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin for years. According to the Journal, Musk has been chatting with Putin since 2022. The Journal based its reporting on conversations with officials in the U.S., Europe, and Russia. It’s been an open secret in powerful political circles for years. What do the world’s richest man and a brutal authoritarian have to discuss? Quite a bit, as it turns out. They’ve reportedly chatted about business, personal issues, and the state of the world. Musk is an important government contractor with a security clearance and hands in a lot of different companies. SpaceX alone has billions in government contracts, and some of them are so sensitive that the very nature of them is classified, including one issued in 2021 for $1.8 billion. Musk’s Starlink has proved an incredible battleground tool. The satellite internet service has been instrumental in keeping lines of communication open in the war in Ukraine. Musk has donated more than a thousand Starlink terminals to Kyiv, and the Pentagon has footed the bill for hundreds more. But they don’t always work like they should. Last year, Ukrainian drone operators complained that the signal to drones above the Black Sea cut out as they approached Russian-occupied Crimea. Starlink has repeatedly said that its terminals are not meant to be weapons of war and should be reserved for civilian use. But the terminals keep popping up in Russia as well, arriving there from other countries. And Moscow has been using them for war. When Starlink catches the rogue terminals, it cuts them off. According to the Journal, Musk and Putin have chatted about Starlink during their various private conversations. Putin asked Musk to not activate Starlink terminals in Taiwan. He wanted the billionaire to do it as a personal favor to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Again, Musk has a security clearance. He’s an important military contractor whom the Pentagon relies on to efficiently conduct the business of war. He’s also a reckless fool who has involved himself with a foreign dictator and injected himself into domestic politics. The man is a national security risk, full stop. And though the Pentagon has investigated him and reprimanded him over his public and rumored drug use, it has yet to pull his security clearance. When Semafor asked NASA Administrator Bill Nelson about the story on Friday, Nelson said he’d mostly dealt with people other than Musk and that SpaceX had been “phenomenally successful.” “I don’t know if that story is true. I think it should be investigated.” Nelson added. “If it’s true there have been multiple conversations with Elon Musk and the president of Russia, then that would be concerning, particularly for NASA and the Department of Defense, for some of the intelligence agencies. Asked about the WSJ report on Elon Musk's conversations with Putin, @SenBillNelson tells @burgessev: \"[SpaceX] have been phenomenally successful … I don't know that that story is true. I think it should be investigated. If the story is true … that would be concerning.\" pic.twitter.com/5Mlo2AEDNx — Semafor (@semafor) October 25, 2024  None of it may matter if Donald Trump becomes the next president of the United States. And Musk is doing his damndest to make that happen. The billionaire has been spending money on the Trump campaign like it’s going out of style. He’s never been politically neutral, but he’s also never been this personally involved in a candidate. Through his America PAC and other offerings, Musk has shoveled an estimated $118.5 million into the campaign since the summer. Musk is also offering $47 to registered swing state voters willing to sign a petition saying they’re in support of free speech and the Second Amendment. Signing the petition also enters people into a lottery with the chance to win $1 million. Musk has promised he’ll give away a huge cash prize to one petition signer every day until the election as he attempts to make himself into the MrBeast of politics. If that sounds weird and illegal, you’re not the only one who thinks that. Only petition signers in the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, and North Carolina are eligible for the payday. And though the petition and its rules aren’t explicit about who those voters should cast a ballot for, it’s hard to imagine anyone signing doesn’t know who Musk would prefer. After Musk announced the sweepstakes, the Justice Department sent a letter of warning to his America PAC. The DOJ told the PAC that the lottery may violate federal election law. But Musk is still giving away prizes. Last night, just before 11 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, the America PAC published a picture of Jason Holland of Michigan holding a large novelty check. Holland grinned in his photo above a link directing people to sign the petition. \nelection 2024Elon MuskPutinStarlinkTrump  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The why and how of leaving X.

            "content": "I’ve been uncomfortable ever since I learned (via TechCrunch) about this toilet seat with a camera that takes pictures of your poop. Courtesy of an Austin-based health startup, Throne, this seat is currently available to preorder for $299 or $499 if you purchase it after the preorder period ends. It’s in beta mode at the moment. The concept is to photograph your feces so the seat can provide feedback on your gut health and hydration levels. It’s powered by an AI model that Throne calls “artificial gut intelligence.” According to the company, the AI is “trained by physicians to help you understand what your waste is trying to tell you about your health.” This makes the seat suitable for folks with gut health issues but could also help perfectly healthy people. Of course, the biggest concern here is privacy, which Throne has tried its best to defend. It has a dedicated privacy and security page on the site that outlines everything it’s done to ensure it. First, it promises the images to strictly capture the toilet bowl and nothing else, adding, “We use image recognition technology to automatically delete any non-relevant images” and “Any other data is irrelevant to our mission and could compromise our ability to provide accurate health insights.” It also mentions that you can contact the company here at any time to request access to your information or demand an account deletion. Throne clarifies that the images are all anonymized and not shared with third parties. Despite the many security measures, I’m unsure how I’d feel about this incredibly invasive tech clipping onto my toilet seat. As someone with no gut health issues, I don’t have much reason to go for it, but it’d be interesting to show this to my perpetually constipated sister and see if it’s something she’d ever consider. TechCrunch mentions that Throne started as a healthcare staffing marketplace but soon realized the space was overly saturated. It then pivoted to producing consumer tech and chose a camera-installed toilet seat as its debut. Toilet seats can really do it all these days. I recently checked out Toto’s new washlet that does a ridiculous number of things for you, including auto-opening and closing, pre-misting the bowl before use, heating up, washing and drying your butt and the seat, deodorizing the air when you’re done with your business, among many other functions. So maybe a toilet that’ll tell you if your poop is healthy doesn’t seem too much of a stretch. \nCamerasSmart Home  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Picture a HomePod with a display as big as two iPhones placed side by side.\n         \n          The Altas PT Ultra lasts more than a year on a single charge and retails for only $180.\n         \n          Google TV also has a new dedicated sports panel to see scores in realtime.\n         \n          Drone maker DJI plans to take on GoPro with its Osmo Action 5’s better low-light quality and improved sensor it claims rivals professional cameras.\n         \n          The future of drone warfare could hinge on the unique structures found in your laziest pet's peepers.\n         \n          This Wall-E style robot will do everything except take out your trash.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Hasbro’s awesome HasLab program just announced another release and this time around our first thought is “That’s a big Twinkie.” The toy company is once again back to the world of Ghostbusters and this time it’s bringing to life arguably the most iconic piece in the franchise, the Ecto-1. Oh, sure there have been Ecto-1s before. All kinds. But never in Habro’s sixth-scale “Plasma Series” like this. It measures almost 24 inches long, 10 inches high, and eight inches wide. It’s a beast and, as is the case with all HasLabs, this one is filled with all sorts of cool details, extra add-ons, and more. “The HasLab Lab worked directly with our partners at Ghost Corps to create the most authentic and movie-accurate 6-inch-scale Ectomobile possible,” the site writes. “Our design team was even able to visit and photograph an actual Ecto, and boy howdy, did they get all up in that car’s business, as indicated by the eerily insane amount of detail included in this six-inch-scale replica.” Two versions are available—the Ghostbusters Plasma Series Ectomobile (Anniversary Edition) [Base Model] at $325 and the Ghostbusters Plasma Series Ectomobile (Anniversary Edition) [Deluxe Model] for $400. Which, yes, is expensive, but look at this baby and tell us it isn’t worth it. These are just a few images. For the money though, it’s almost silly not to order the deluxe one. For an extra $75 you get—bare minimum—four brand new Ghostbusters figures that can go inside the Ecto-1. Each of those is worth $20-$25 each. Plus, you get a bunch of cool little trinkets that let you change it into the brighter, louder version from Ghostbusters II. But, if you don’t want to spend that much, both do come with the cool Librarian figure as well as the Slimer figure and, if the project gets fully funded in two weeks, a Louis Tully figure. Which, come on… that’s worth $400 alone. But, yes, this is HasLab so it’s big, expensive, and not guaranteed. It only gets made if 12,000 people back it in 45 days. But, since 3,000 people have backed it as we write this, and it’s only been up a few hours, we’d imagine it’ll hit that goal very soon.

Have you put much thought into what you’re getting your family and friends this year? If you have not, maybe first start with a gift for yourself. You can set yourself up with a Costco gold star membership and then get all your gifts this year at Costco. The place has pretty much everything after all. Right now, StackSocial is promoting a deal in which you can get a yearlong membership for just $65 and it will include a $45 digital gift card, which you might as well put toward your holiday shopping. See at StackSocial This past summer, StackSocial was running a similar deal, but it only granted new members a measly $20 gift card. Now the bonus has been more than doubled to $45. That’s so many more $1.50 hot dogs you can buy (30 of them total). And that price is not changing anytime soon, as many folks know, the the founder of Costco allegedly told a CEO who wanted to raise it, “If you raise the effing hot dog, I will kill you.” A Costco gold membership will allow you to shop at over 600 locations within the United States as well as over 800 locations worldwide. You’ll be able to use your card at Costco’s business centers, travel, gas stations, hearing aid centers, optical, pharmacies and, of course, Costco’s website. You can share the membership among anyone in your household. Just send them off with the household card and they’ll be permitted to shop at a Costco location. If you want even more perks for yourself, you can sign up instead for the executive membership. With that, you’ll gain all the perks that come along with the gold membership, but you’ll also be privy to additional benefits and greater discounts on select Costco services. These include lower prices on check printing and free roadside assistance through vehicles in the auto insurance program. You’ll also be granted an annual 2% reward (up to $1,250) on qualified Costco purchases. The Costco gold membership is going for just $65 while the executive membership is $130. Both come with the digital Costco shop card. Upon signing up, the $45 Costco card will be sent directly via email from Costco within two weeks after successfully redeeming. The digital credit is not just one-time use, so you don’t have to spend the $45 at once. This deal is valid for new members only  or for members whose memberships have expired more than 18 months ago.

With a standard listing price of $63, the additional 9% coupon brings this high-quality monitor within reach for budget-conscious shoppers just ahead of Black Friday. See at Amazon This 15.6-inch Full HD monitor boasts a resolution of 1920x1080px and ensures vibrant and sharp visuals that are perfect for both work and play. The advanced IPS matte screen offers a 178-degree viewing angle which means colors remain consistent and bright from various perspectives. This feature is particularly beneficial for collaborative environments where multiple people may need to view the screen simultaneously. The monitor’s design effectively reduces blue light radiation and minimizes eye strain during extended use. The MNN monitor also boasts a double Type-C ports for seamless plug-and-play connectivity. Users can connect the monitor to their laptops, PCs, phones, and gaming consoles like PS5, PS4, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch using just one USB Type-C cable for both power and display signal transmission. It’s an ideal companion for gamers and remote workers alike, and it’s so cheap that you don’t take any risks. Weighing in as an ultra-slim and lightweight device, this MNN portable monitor which is sold on Amazon is designed with travel in mind. Its compact size allows it to fit easily into backpacks or suitcases without adding significant weight, making it perfect for students, business travelers, or anyone on the go. The inclusion of a smart cover not only protects the screen from scratches but also serves as a stand. The extra MNN monitor supports multiple display modes—Copy Mode, Extended Mode, Second Screen Mode, and Portrait Mode—which enhances productivity by providing additional screen real estate. This flexibility is particularly useful during meetings or presentations where having a second screen can significantly improve efficiency. For gamers, switching to HDR mode elevates the visual experience by enhancing brightness and color depth, resulting in more immersive gameplay. In comparison to other monitors available during this early Black Friday season, the MNN Portable Monitor stands out due to its combination of quality features and affordability. Similar products have been seen at higher price points without offering the same level of versatility or performance. For instance, other monitors with comparable specifications often retail above $100 even during sales events.

Avoid all of that unnecessary, stress-inducing clutter by getting yourself one device that can charge all others! Anker’s MagSafe 3-in-1 charging station is designed for use with Apple products like the iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch and can wireless charge all three of them at the same time. Right now, its going for 20% off as part of a limited time deal at Amazon, meaning you’d save $18. The deal brings the price down from $90 to just $72.

The charger features three panels for wireless charging of differing sizes to match each of those three. As a wireless charger, it’ll support generations of iPhone from the 12 and up, the most recent generation of AirPods cases, and every Apple Watch. See at Amazon One of the most remarkable aspects of this wireless charging station is just how efficient it is in the space it takes up. It’s just the three connected panels that when not in use, can be folded up with the durable silicone strap into a pocket-sized 2.36 inch form to be taken with you wherever you go.

The charger comes with an included 40W Power Deliver adapter and USB-C to USB-C cable, capable of super fast charging so you don’t have to wait all day or night for you iPhone and additional accessories to fully charge up. and iPhone 15 Pro can reach 20% from zero in just 15 minutes. Likewise an Apple Watch Series 9 can reach 30% in 22 minutes. Right now, the Anker MagSafe Compatible MagGo UFO 3-in-1 charger is 20% off.

The NanoPhone — all 2.8 ounces of it — is anything but. It’s a fully functional Android smartphone with all the features and functions you need from your cellphone, and it’s just $100 at StackSocial right now — half off its usual $200 price. The NanoPhone’s amazingly small dimensions are 0.4 inches thick x 3.5 inches long x 1.8 inches wide. It’s not just pocket-sized, it can fit in that little change pocket in your pants. It’s the ultimate in small, easily carried, yet still powerful cellphones. See at StackSocial It’s been a long time — since the Apple iPhone 12 Mini, to be exact — that anyone has met the demand for a smaller phone that can still hang and bang with the bigger models. Since then it’s been all about bigger “Pro” and “Max” models that aren’t exactly pocket-friendly. The NanoPhone is most definitely pocket-sized, and it doesn’t deprive you of features or connections. It’s 4G and Wi-Fi connectable, running smoothly and speedily on the Android 10 OS. It somehow manages to have front- and rear-facing cameras and even a microSD slot while being roughly the size of a business card. It’s only natural to handle something this small very gingerly, as if it might break just from being held, but there’s no need for such concerns with the ruggedly constructed NanoPhone. And it has dual SIM card support so you can use separate cards for work and home, or bring it with you on international trips without huge roaming bills. Giving away bulk does not mean giving away social interactions when you downsize to the NanoPhone. Regular phone calls come through crisp and clear, and the cameras make video calling easy and high-quality. All your favorite social apps, from Instagram and TikTok to WhatsApp and YouTube, come through as easily as they would on any larger phone. The NanoPhone makes a great primary phone, or a handy emergency backup phone that can be easily stashed away thanks to its compact size and featherweight heft. It’s just $100 right now at StackSocial, a 50% off deal that’s perfect for anyone who misses the days when cellphones were designed to fit in a pocket instead of being slightly smaller tablets.

            "content": "Spare a thought for the people of Coulsdon, England, who say they’re being categorically oppressed by the heavy hand of algorithmic censorship for no reason other than the seemingly innocuous spelling of their town’s name. According to the local news blog Inside Croydon, business owners and neighborhood associations in the town have had content removed from their Facebook pages because the platform’s content moderation algorithms are picking up the “LSD” in Coulsdon as a reference to the psychedelic drug. The blog, quoting local sources who declined to be named, said that pages for local theaters, hardware stores, history groups, and residents’ associations had all been affected by the censorship and that Facebook has not fixed the issue despite multiple complaints. “As long as it has ‘Coulsdon’ in the title, you get the drug reference that there’s no way around,” one anonymous source told Inside Croydon. In a brief statement, Dave Arnold, a spokesperson for Facebook’s parent company, Meta, said “this was an error that has now been fixed.” It wouldn’t be the first time Facebook’s filters blocked posts containing harmless—or possibly life-saving—information. In 2021, Facebook apologized to some English users for censoring and banning people who posted about the Plymouth Hoe, a landmark in the coastal city of Plymouth. The Washington Post reported earlier this year that as wildfires raged across the West Coast, the company’s algorithms censored posts about the blazes in local emergency management and fire safety groups. In dozens of examples documented by the newspaper, Facebook flagged the posts as “misleading” spam. Facebook group administrators have also previously noticed patterns of posts in their communities that contained the word “men” being flagged as hate speech, according to Vice. The phenomenon led to the creation of facebookjailed.com, where users documented bizarre moderation decisions, like a picture of a chicken being labeled nudity or sexual activity. Facebook’s own data shows that its heavy reliance on algorithms to police content on the platform leads to millions of mistakes each month. According to its most recent moderation data, Facebook took 1.7 million enforcement actions on drug-related content between April and June of this year. About 98 percent of that content was detected by the company, compared to just 2 percent reported by users. People appealed the sanctions in 182,000 cases and Facebook ended up restoring more than 40,000 pieces of content—11,700 without any need for an appeal and 28,500 after an appeal. The algorithms targeting other types of banned content, like spam, result in even more mistakes. The platform restored nearly 35 million posts it erroneously labeled as spam during the most recent three-month period, more than 10 percent of the allegedly spammy content it previously removed. \nFacebook  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Donald Trump's victory was a bat-signal for Silicon Valley oligarchs.\n         \n          China’s People’s Liberation Army is using Llama 13B for military applications.

            "content": "Amazon Prime over the years has expanded to include a hodgepodge of benefits, and starting today members will begin receiving a new one: fuel discounts. Starting with gasoline, Amazon says that Prime members will receive a 10 cents per gallon discount at roughly 7,000 stations across the U.S. under the brands Amoco, AM/PM, and BP stations. The company estimates that members could save about $70 annually on fuel, which is half the price of an annual Prime membership of $139 (it’s a bit more if you pay by the month). Next year, the company will add electric vehicle charging through BP Pulse. Prime launched in 2005 offering free deliveries on Amazon.com, but today the membership program includes additional benefits like free streaming through Amazon Video, unlimited cloud photo storage, and Grubhub+ membership, to name a few. Prime has over 180 million subscribers globally and is estimated to have generated more than $40 billion in revenue for Amazon last year. Bundling has become more common in the subscription business these days as giants like Amazon seek to reduce churn and fend off competition. It’s long been in fierce rivalry against Walmart, which offers its Walmart+ membership program, which also offers similar perks to Amazon as well as free same-day delivery of groceries. By including lots of perks in the membership, Amazon hopes you’ll use a couple of them and decide it’s not worth the hassle to cancel and seek out replacements. Unfortunately, anyone who has tried shopping on Amazon in recent years knows that it’s something of a mess, with sponsored listings taking up much of the page, millions of Chinese knockoff brands of quality that is hard to discern, inconsistent product pages that make it hard to find the information you want, and fake reviews making for an overall poor shopping experience. It’s not far off from Temu or Shein at this point, and not somewhere to search for quality items. But hey, The Boys is a well-liked show, and those new Kindles look nice. Forgetting free shipping, the other perks are kind of the real reason to have a Prime subscription at this point. And if you drive a lot, the new gas discount certainly is a nice addition. \nAmazon Prime  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Across the globe, Prime packages will now be cushioned by paper.\n         \n          A few tips to save your money and your peace of mind.\n         \n          Amazon Prime Video is rolling out a redesign that leans heavily on AI recommendations in order to streamline your viewing experience so you can get down to enjoying a movie or TV series in a quicker fashion.\n         \n          Amazon Prime Video is turning into its own nuclear wasteland with the addition of pause ads all designed to get you to buy stuff on Amazon.\n         \n          A proposed class action lawsuit accuses the e-commerce company of deceptive practices and is seeking $5 million in damages.\n         \n          Streamers of the world should revolt against this most odious of price hikes.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Americans are rushing into voting booths across the country today to raise their hand for either Donald Trump (the fascist piece of shit who wants to do bad things) or Kamala Harris (the moderate Democrat who wants to do good things). But the presidency isn’t the only thing on the ballot. Voters will be deciding on local races as well as local issues, including everything from abortion rights to property taxes. And voters in four states will decide the fate of weed legalization, with an additional state even voting on legalizing psychedelics. Recreational cannabis is legal in 24 states, with 38 states allowing for medical use. And it’s impossible to overstate how big of a shift that is from 20 years ago. Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize weed in 2012 and new states have been added ever since, despite it still being illegal at the federal level. Kamala Harris has pledged to make cannabis legal on the federal level if she’s elected president. Meanwhile, Trump has promised to put Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in charge of all things health a the FDA and USDA. You may recall that he’s the guy who wants to ban junk food like Doritos. It seems like a clear choice for stoners, America. Voters in Florida will consider Amendment 3 today, which would legalize cannabis for recreational use for anyone 21 years of age and older. The measure would let people possess up to three ounces of cannabis or five ounces of cannabis concentrate. The measure needs 60% of the vote to be approved and the latest polling is encouraging, with 60% supporting it, 34% opposed, and 6% undecided. Gov. Ron DeSantis, a notorious dipshit who supports Trump, opposes Amendment 3 and has made a big push to campaign against legalization. DeSantis was in Orlando and Miami on Monday to make his case, trying to scare anyone around by using a variety of different angles. “If you’re not 100% convinced that this is a good idea, then you gotta vote no,” DeSantis said, according to local TV news channel WFLA. DeSantis also tried to insist that this measure would help weed businesses, falsely claiming that the measure would only be good for established companies and ban homegrown cannabis. “They do not give you the right to grow your own marijuana on your own property,” DeSantis said. “That’s by design because they’re trying to funnel business transactions to them.” It’s a funny argument coming from a supposedly pro-business “conservative,” of course. But it’s not really about homegrown weed or anything else reasonable or rational, obviously. Guys like DeSantis want recreational weed to stay illegal because the war on drugs is fundamentally a war on poor people and racial minorities. Rich Floridians with good lawyers don’t go to prison when they’re caught with cannabis. That’s for the people DeSantis hates so much. The latest polling average from 538 for Florida has Trump ahead 6.6 points over Harris. Both recreational and medical cannabis are legal in Massachusetts, but the Bay State could become the third state in the country to legalize some psychedelic drugs, following in the path of Oregon and Colorado. Known as Question 4, the ballot measure would legalize things like psilocybin mushrooms from licensed sellers. Five drugs would become legal dimethyltryptamine (DMT), mescaline, ibogaine, psilocybin, and psilocybin, as long as they were obtained by therapy centers for people 21 years of age and older. Retail shops for these drugs would still be illegal, but the bill would also decriminalize possession of these five drugs for personal use. Recent polling shows voters in Massachusetts evenly split on Question 4, with 43% opposing and 43% supporting, according to a recent survey conducted by the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and WCVB. The 14% of people who are undecided on the question are likely to decide how it goes. “This ballot question only enjoys majoritarian support among a small number of demographic and political groups in the state that include young people, Democrats, liberals and Biden voters,”  Tatishe Nteta, the director of the poll, said in a statement published online. “Older voters, independents, Republicans and parents are particularly opposed to this ballot question, and given the high turnout among these groups in particular, this does not bode well for those who seek to make Massachusetts the third state in the nation to make these substances legal,” Nteta said. The latest polling average from 538 for Massachusetts has Harris ahead 26.2 points over Trump. The good people of Nebraska will vote on two measures regarding cannabis today. Ballot Initiative 437 would let healthcare professionals recommend weed to patients while legalizing the possession and use of cannabis for those residents. And Ballot Initiative 438 would create a Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission to regulate the sale and distribution of the drug. How does it look in the Cornhusker State? According to the latest polling from Midwest Newsroom Emerson College, 59% say they’re going to vote yes, and 33% say they’ll vote no, with 8% unsure, reports Nebraska Public Media. A legal case has sought to throw out all the votes, arguing that there was some kind of fraud going on during the signature collection that allowed the marijuana measures to get on the ballot. But a judge recently ruled that the votes will be counted. A final ruling on the case isn’t expected for about two weeks, meaning that even if the initiatives pass, they could still be invalidated down the line, but at least people will get to have their say on the matter. For now. The latest polling average from 538 for Nebraska has Trump ahead 16.4 points over Harris. As one of the most politically conservative states in the country, it’s no surprise that it hasn’t legalized marijuana for recreational use yet, though it has been legal for medical purposes since 2016. Ballot measures to make recreational use legal failed in 2018 and 2022. But advocates are trying it again this year. North Dakota’s Initiated Measure 5 is appearing on the ballot and would legalize recreational use and possession for any residents 21 years of age and older. If it does pass, adults would be allowed to have up to one ounce of cannabis, four grams of concentrate, and 1,500 milligrams of edibles. How will the proposed change fare this time? The latest polling shows 45% support legalization, 40% are opposed, and 15% are undecided, according to the North Dakota Monitor, which notes that the measure is being supported by an organization called New Economic Frontier, which is trying to promote legalization as a good thing for business and tax revenue growth. But legalization has strong opposition from big conservative organizations like the North Dakota Medical and Hospital Associations, North Dakota Peace Officers, Chiefs of Police Association of North Dakota, and the North Dakota Sheriffs and Deputies Associations. FiveThirtyEight doesn’t have a polling average for North Dakota but the latest poll the outlet tracks has Trump ahead 27 points over Harris. South Dakota’s Initiated Measure 29 will be decided by voters on Tuesday, which would legalize the consumption of recreational weed for anyone 21 years of age and older, though it doesn’t legalize the sale of weed and has a special carve-out allowing employers to ban consumption by their employees. Medical cannabis is already legal in the state. But the latest polling does not look good for people who’d like to see recreational marijuana legalized in South Dakota. A disappointing 50% of voters in the state oppose the measure, with 45% supporting it, according to a poll conducted by Emerson College Polling/KELO-TV/The Hill. FiveThirtyEight doesn’t have a polling average for South Dakota but the latest poll the outlet tracks has Trump ahead 28 points over Harris. Nobody knows for sure what will happen on Tuesday, both for the presidency and these weed legalization measures. But if all four states considering weed today vote to legalize it in some form, there will be just 8 of the 50 states where marijuana is completely illegal. And any one of the four states legalizing would bring the number of states with recreational use up to a full half of the entire country, with 25. If you haven’t voted yet today, wherever you are in the U.S., make sure you do that.

Weirdly enough, it appears that Trump’s top campaign operative, Elon Musk, agrees that the candidate’s policies could damage the economy. For the second time in a week, Musk has weirdly implied that Trump will bring economic “hardship” to America, a claim that would be funny if it didn’t seem so likely. The first instance came during a “Telephone Town Hall” hosted on the tech billionaire’s website X, during which Musk said, cryptically: “We have to reduce spending to live within our means. And that necessarily involves some temporary hardship, but it will ensure long-term prosperity.” Musk, who was talking about reducing the national debt when he made the comments, didn’t elaborate on what he was referring to. If that may have spooked some voters, Musk did nothing to assuage their fears when, on Monday, the tech billionaire again seemed to affirm a vision of coming adversity for Americans. Musk did this by replying to a rightwing account on X, the likes of which had written a screed about a coming economic “tumble”: If Trump succeeds in forcing through mass deportations, combined with Elon hacking away at the government, As crazy as it sounds, firing people and reducing the deficit – there will be an initial severe overreaction in the economy – this economy propped up with debt (generating asset bubbles) and artificially suppressed wages (as a result of illegal immigration). Markets will tumble. But when the storm passes and everyone realizes we are on sounder footing, there will be a rapid recovery to a healthier, sustainable economy. History could be made in the coming two years. Musk replied: “sounds about right.” Plenty of economists have warned that Trump’s plans could spell disaster for the U.S. economy. His plans to deport millions of illegal immigrants, give huge tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, weaken the U.S. dollar, and institute global tariffs, have all been referred to as terrible ideas that could drive up the federal deficit, spur inflation, and cause chaos. Trump advisors’ have espoused plans—like making huge cuts to federal spending and firing tens of thousands of government workers—that would surely spur more chaos. That said, it is thoroughly bizarre to see Musk—a key Trump ally—admit this, whilst in the middle of one of the tightest presidential races in modern history. Why would Musk do this? It seems notable that one of Musk’s heroes is the current president of Argentina, Javier Milei, who has been credited with taking a “chainsaw” to the nation’s government. Milei, an avowed “free market,” “anti-woke” libertarian, took office in December of 2023, and has instituted what he calls an “austerity” budget, characterized by economic “shock treatment.” This strategy has involved making deep cuts to government spending on social welfare programs, devaluing the peso, and cutting thousands of government jobs, all in the hope of some vague libertarian glowup in the near to far future. The parallels between Milei’s government and the plans espoused by Trump’s allies are worth considering. While the U.S. and Argentina are two very different countries, the ideology animating Milei’s transformation of his government, and the ideology fueling many of Trump’s advisors is essentially the same. ProPublica recently revealed the espoused goals of powerful Trump advisor, and rightwing libertarian, Russell Vought, who is said to be a key figure in Project 2025, the anti-government effort promulgated by the Heritage Foundation. Vought has similarly said that he wants to drastically reorganize the federal government and put career civil servants “in trauma.” Musk, himself, has advocated for a “Government Efficiency” task force, the likes of which would “audit” public agencies to look for inefficiencies. Like Milei’s strategy, Trump advisors see a leaner, stripped-down bureaucracy as the key to long-term national wealth. That said, Argentina under Milei does not seem to be seeing a whole lot of wealth. In the first six months of his presidency, the nation’s poverty rates spiked by 10 percent and, last year, its inflation rate soared to 211 percent, the highest it had been in 32 years. Rates of homelessness and job loss have been seen to increase. Many Argentinians have been literally “scavenging” dumpsters to survive, Reuters reported in March. Inflation in the country is now slowing, but only after climbing to the highest rate in the world. When Milei took office last December, his comment, much like Musk’s, was: “We know that in the short term the situation will worsen.” Mission accomplished, I guess. For whatever reason, Trump’s supporters view him as a competent and successful businessman and have fond memories of the economy under his presidency. Despite these widely held beliefs, lots of credible economic data suggest that Trump actually inherited a strong economy (the likes of which had been in a period of sustained recovery ever since the 2008 financial crisis) from the outgoing Obama administration and that Trump’s policies actually served to undermine that strong economy, not help it. Ironically, Trump’s economic plans seem designed to harm his voter base—a situation his voters clearly do not understand. For instance, Trump has claimed he wants to end taxes on Social Security. Voters at a rally recently cheered for this proposal, ostensibly because they don’t like taxes. However, Social Security only continues to exist thanks to taxes. Trump’s suggestion is tantamount to a bank telling a small business that it’s going to cut off its line of credit; the business would flounder and die. Ending taxes on SS would starve and ultimately bankrupt the program in a matter of years, leading to tens of millions of Americans being thrown into poverty. Conversely, Harris has announced plans to save the program by raising taxes on the top 1 percent of Americans. The silver lining to all of this is that should Trump win the presidency and should he try to cram through many of his team’s screwball, rightwing economic proposals, he would obviously need the approval of Congress to pass them. It is unlikely that he would receive such approval. That said, the very fact that such harmful policies are being floated is scary enough. \nDonald TrumpElon Musk  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Trump seems to have just two options.\n         \n          The head of one of the world's largest oil companies has had it with government flip-flopping.\n         \n          The why and how of leaving X.

            "content": "The Federal Trade Commission is investigating tractor manufacturer John Deere over long standing allegations that Deere makes its farm equipment hard to repair. The investigation has been ongoing since 2021, and we know more about it now thanks to a court filing made public on Thursday. A data analytics company called Hargrove & Associates Inc (HAI) who works for the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM), of which John Deere is a prominent member, filed a court brief in an attempt to quash the FTC’s investigation. The FTC wants HAI to turn over data submitted from AEM about sales, but HAI is saying that the FTC’s request is too broad and could hurt its business. Court drama aside, HAI spelled out exactly what the FTC is looking for. “The stated purpose of the FTC’s [investigation] is ‘[t]o determine whether Deere & Company, or any other person, has engaged in or is engaging in unfair, deceptive, anticompetitive, collusive, coercive, predatory, exploitative, or exclusionary acts or practices in or affecting commerce related to the repair of agricultural equipment in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act,’” HAI said in the court records. John Deere has been notorious for years for making its farm equipment hard to repair. Much like today’s cars, John Deere’s farm equipment comes with a lot of computers. When something simple in one of its tractors or threshers breaks, a farmer can’t just fix it themselves. Even if the farmer has the technical and mechanical know-how to make a simple repair, they often have to return to the manufacturer at great expense. Why? The on-board computers brick the machines until a certified Deere technician flips a switch. Farmers have been complaining about this for years and Deere has repeatedly promised to make its tractors easier to repair. It lied. John Deere equipment was so hard to repair that it led to an explosion in the used tractor market. Old farm equipment made before the advent of onboard computing sold for a pretty penny because it was easier to repair. In 2022, a group of farmers filed a class action lawsuit against John Deere and accused it of running a repair monopoly. Deere, of course, attempted to get the case dismissed but failed. Last year, the company issued a “memorandum of understanding.” The document was a promise to farmers that it would finally let them repair their own equipment, so long as states didn’t pass any laws around the right to repair. Chief among Deere’s promises was that it would provide farmers and independent repair shops with the equipment and documentation they needed to repair their equipment. The promises of the memorandum have not come to pass. Senator Elizabeth Warren called Deere out in a letter about all of this on October 2. “Rather than uphold their end of the bargain, John Deere has provided impaired tools and inadequate disclosures,” Warren said in the letter. Now we know, thanks to HAI’s court filing, that the FTC has been investigating John Deere for at least three years. That’s good news for farmers and anyone who buys groceries. “We are grateful that the FTC has taken our complaint seriously and is investigating Deere’s conduct. We should be able to fix our own stuff. When farmers can’t access the proprietary software tools which are required to diagnose or complete repairs, that means they have to wait for an authorized technician before they can finish their work,” Nathan Proctor, U.S. PIRG’s senior right to repair campaign director, said in a statement. “The weather doesn’t wait on a dealership’s schedule—a delay could mean the loss of your harvest.” \nFTCJohn Deere  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The FTC's ban on writing, buying, or selling fake reviews is officially in effect.\n         \n          If she wins in November, there are indicators that Harris will keep the controversial FTC head, a new report claims.\n         \n          Subscription providers will be required to inform customers what they're signing up for, obtain customer consent, and provide clear mechanisms to cancel.\n         \n          A scathing new report takes aim directly at Big Tech and alleged violations of privacy.\n         \n          1Health.io left its customers genetic information unsecured in unencrypted and publicly accessible AWS servers.\n         \n          The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is calling this a victory as it holds back the American worker.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "The Microsoft Surface Laptop has its fans. It’s thin, it’s fast, and it works. The latest rendition of the laptop also bears the flag for a new generation of Qualcomm’s ARM-based Snapdragon Elite chips on Windows PCs. But it seems Microsoft might have a surprise for all those wanting an Intel x86 Lunar Lake chip that can go toe-to-toe in performance and battery life without sacrificing software compatibility. A Microsoft Surface laptop… surfaced on the Chinese website Goofish bearing an Intel’s Lunar Lake chip made for ultra-small notebooks. Redditors and Windows Central first picked up on the leak, but it’s not something Gizmodo can independently confirm since the entry has since been deleted. Based on anonymous sources; Windows Central noted that Microsoft is testing Lunark Lake Surface Laptops. These new models could arrive as soon as 2025 if the anonymous sources are to be believed. Leak: Lunar Lake Surface Laptop 7 on Chinese eBay byu/Akaza_Dorian inSurface    We don’t know if Microsoft would simply repeat the Surface Laptop 7 or launch a new Surface Laptop 8, but we’re far more curious about how this specific Surface bore an Intel Core Ultra 7 268V. That’s a significant step up from many of the first sub-16-inch laptops with Lunar Lake, like the Asus Zenbook S 14, which contained either a Core Ultra 7 256V or a 258V, while larger laptops like the still-unreleased Acer Swift 16 AI are supposed to have the Core Ultra 9 288V. If Microsoft is considering releasing a next-gen Surface Laptop, it would be at the top of its class. The 268V has four cores and four threads, plus a 5.0 clock speed and the second highest-frequency Arc 140V GPU in the Ultra 2 lineup. It has the same memory as the top-end Core Ultra 9 288V, though it doesn’t have nearly the same base TDP. That specific listing on Goofish noted that the price of this supposed Surface Laptop was 19,000 CNY, or $2,600 U.S. You should take that price with a grain of salt, though the specs are interesting. It was packing 32 GB of RAM and 1 TB of storage, so it would be one of the top-end configurations. A current 13.8-inch Surface Laptop 7 with the Snapdragon Elite CPU, 32 GB of RAM, and 1 TB SSD starts at $2,000, while the 15-inch version goes for $2,100. The previous version of the Surface Laptop with the first-gen Meteor Lake chips was only available in the company’s business line. Enterprise laptops are usually more expensive than consumer-grade devices, so there may be a reason why the price shown on Goofish was as high as it was. While we at Gizmodo weren’t nearly as thrilled with the Surface Pro 11’s form factor and battery life, the Qualcomm Snapdragon Elite chip is no joke. It handily beats Meteor Lake and Apple M3 Chips in several benchmarks in multi-core settings. Intel’s Arrow Lake chips were hoping to prove ARM isn’t the future, but we’re still waiting for the top-end chips in an actual laptop to prove that point. \nIntelLunar LakeMicrosoftQualcomm  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          How about pizza parties next?\n         \n          Google accidentally leaked its AI agent on the Chrome extension store but quickly removed it.

            "content": "Since The Office ended, Brian Baumgartner—who played the show’s subdued, perfunctory “Kevin Malone”—has made a second career for himself as one of the top earners on Cameo, the website that allows celebrities to leave personalized messages for fans. A report in 2021 claimed that Baumgartner had made over a million dollars through Cameo videos alone. Weirdly enough, it would appear that, in one case, Baumgartner’s friendly online videos accidentally contributed to an aggressive disinformation campaign aimed at toppling the current president of Moldova. A new report from Wired claims that Baumgartner was one of a number of celebrities who recently made a Cameo video decrying the President Maia Sandu. “We, Hollywood stars, support the people of Moldova in their desire to overthrow you, Sandu,” the actors said. That video was subsequently tied into what has been described as a “tide of disinformation unprecedented in complexity and aggression” aimed at the tiny eastern European nation. To find evidence of this development, Wired dug through a web archived report from DFRLab, a research group attached to the Atlantic Council, that had written about the video. Wired also cites a previous report from NPR that notes the unfortunate trend of celebrities being unwittingly tied into online propaganda campaigns. The reason that Moldova may be getting targeted with disinformation is that it is currently in the middle of a contentious presidential election. Sandu, the current president, is seeking re-election against her opponent, Alexandr Stoianoglo, a candidate who has been described as more “Russia-friendly.” The country has also been readying for a referendum on whether it should join the European Union or not. On Monday, early returns showed that Moldovans had backed the referendum by a very thin margin. Russia has consistently sought to keep the nations along its border (Moldova is one) from joining Western coalitions. Some observers of the Ukraine war have claimed that Russia was primarily motivated to invade the country because of ongoing conversations around it joining NATO. Seeing as Baumgartner is one of the top-earning stars on Cameo, it stands to reason that he may not have known what he was getting into. Gizmodo reached out to the actor through AAE Speakers, which purports to represent him for speaking events. We also reached out to Cameo. Disinformation has become a key weapon governments use against vulnerable populations. The West has repeatedly accused Russia of using digital propaganda to manipulate the politics of liberal democracies. That said, it is hardly a practice contained to Russia. Last year, employees of an Israeli psychological war contractor were caught on camera bragging that their business had been involved in as many as 30 elections all over the world. A research report published in 2021 suggested that as many as 81 different countries were engaged in spreading disinformation campaigns, including the U.S. \nBrian BaumgartnerCameoMoldovaThe Office  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Krasinski's fantasy film starring Carell as well as Ryan Reynolds opens May 17.\n         \n          If  stars Ryan Reynolds, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Emily Blunt, Steve Carell, and more, and opens May 17, 2024.\n         \n          Sinclair Daniel  (Insidious: The Red Door)  stars in the surreal new series based on Zakiya Dalila Harris' best-selling novel.\n         \n          It was a tough year to be a financially-responsible adult who's still obsessed with plastic building blocks.\n         \n          Eddie Munson himself will star alongside Lupita Nyong'o in  A Quiet Place: Day One ,   set for release in 2024.\n         \n          Meta announced new virtual spaces from NBC and Peacock at its Connect conference on Tuesday.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

After winning an Oscar for his action-packed comeback role in Everything Everywhere All At Once, Quan landed the lead in Universal’s 2025 action film Love Hurts and now he’s signed on for a Lionsgate action film called Fairytale in New York. Yup, the Ke Huy Quan Kicks Ass genre is just getting started. Fairytale in New York takes place “on Christmas Eve in New York City,” where “an unassuming cab driver takes one last ride before going to celebrate the holiday with his estranged son. After a run-in with a gang of criminals, he embarks on a relentless pursuit to retrieve his kid’s priceless Christmas gift.” So, part Jingle All the Way, part John Wick, and part A Christmas Story. We love it. Plus, it’s directed by Jalmari Helander, who released an incredible action film earlier this year called Sisu. “As soon as we watched Sisu, we knew Jalmari was a filmmaker we wanted to be in business with again,” the chairman of Lionsgate, Adam Fogelson, said in a press release. “Fairytale in New York is a wildly entertaining, thrill ride of an action film and an emotionally resonant story about family. And every once in a while, an actor hits their prime—Ke Huy Quan is having that moment right now and his deep experience crafting action in front of and behind the camera as well as his exceptional likability make him the perfect actor for this project.”  Rory Haines and Sohrab Noshirvani (Black Adam) wrote the film. And while Fairytale in New York doesn’t seem to be about a fairy tale, the past few years for Ke Huy Quan have been exactly that. After instantly rising to stardom in the 1980s with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom as well as The Goonies, the actor found himself largely out of Hollywood. He kept active though, working as a stunt coordinator and more, before finally landing a nice, big role in that eventual Best Picture winner. From there, he joined the MCU in Loki and, in 2025, he’ll play a similarly unassuming guy action guy in Love Hurts, out in February, as well as a role in the Russo Brothers’ sci-fi Netflix movie, The Electric State. No word on a release date for Fairytale in New York but it would be wild if it wasn’t in theaters for the 2025 holiday season. Want more io9 news?

            "content": "Warner Bros. Discovery under the guiding hand of CEO David Zaslav has made a series of puzzling decisions that seem antithetical to meeting fan demands. Key among its highlight reel of letdowns include unceremoniously canceling daring animated show Scavengers Reign and scrapping the completed Batgirl film for tax write-offs. While Warner Bros. has often opted to breeze past its lowlights as a natural part of the entertainment business, Zaslav owned up to the fact that Todd Phillips’ Joker: Folie à Deux was a big letdown. Earlier today, in a Warner Bros. earnings call (first reported by IGN), Zaslav singled out the sequel while expressing his disappointment in the company’s uneven theatrical performance. “Inconsistency also remains an issue at our motion picture studio, as reinforced recently by the disappointing results of Joker 2,” Zaslav said. Zaslav’s comments come following Joker 2 bombing at the box office. On its opening weekend, the gritty DC musical made $37.8 million; it’s since grossed less than $60 million domestically. Suffice it to say, not many people went out of their way to watch Joker 2 in theaters. This isn’t helped by the fact that the film earned a CinemaScore of D, the lowest grade given to a comic book movie. To put things into context, the previous title holder was Fantastic Four, which earned a C-. Even grading on the curve of its 2019 Oscar-winning predecessor, which has 68% positivity from critics and 89% from fans on Rotten Tomatoes, Joker 2 currently sits at 32% from both groups. When put against the film’s outlandish $200 million budget, it wasn’t surprising to witness the movie swiftly receive a digital and video-on-demand release a little over two weeks after its October 29 theatrical release. As IGN notes, Warner Bros. Discovery reported its Q3 revenue of $9.6 billion, which for the pedestrians among us means the media conglomerate is down 3% year-over-year. Likewise, its theatrical revenue is down 40% year-over-year. According to IGN, this financial dip is due to the lower box office performance of films like Beetlejuice Beetlejuice and Twisters against the success of 2023’s Barbie. IGN also reports that Warner Bros. Discovery is “substantially underperforming” in gaming as well. In short, things aren’t looking too hot for the company. In io9’s review, we wrote “Joker: Folie à Deux is less about Arthur than it’s a stand-in for him. It’s a movie and a character that isn’t quite sure what it wants to be, or even what it is, so it messes around and ultimately decides it doesn’t want to be anything at all. At least the first Joker left you with some things to think about. Here you’re just left frustrated at everything that could have been or never was.” Not everyone is down on Joker 2, however. The film has found supporters in folks like Quentin Tarantino and Death Stranding game developer Hideo Kojima, who thinks the film will be looked upon fondly in the next decade. I watched \"Joker: Folie à Deux.” The beginning of the film is an animation sequence, reminiscent of the nostalgic \"Looney Tunes\", depicting a story of Joker and Joker’s shadow. In the trial that follows, the question of his multiple personality is argued from beginning to end.

            "content": "Lina Khan, the head of the Federal Trade Commission, has proven to be a contentious figure—arguably because, unlike some of the FTC chairs who came before her, she seems intent on actually doing her job. Under her chairmanship, the FTC has aggressively pursued actions against some of America’s largest tech companies, ruffling the feathers of Silicon Valley C-suites. As a result, there are more than a few people who want to see her gone when the next administration—be it Trump or Harris—enters the White House. A new report suggests there’s a good chance that Harris will keep Khan, should she win the presidency. The political outlet NOTUS writes that one of Harris’ top economic advisers, Brian Deese, has “advocated” for Harris to keep the young federal official in her role. The outlet cites two sources familiar with the campaign. Gizmodo reached out to the Harris campaign for comment. The list of tech executives that have taken shots at Khan is long. Earlier this year, LinkedIn billionaire and Democratic Party donor Reid Hoffman made waves when he publicly suggested that, should she win the presidency, Harris should fire Khan. Hoffman said that Khan was “not helping America” and that he hoped that “Vice President Harris would replace her.” Notably, Hoffman is a major investor in Microsoft, which has been under fire from Khan’s agency over its various business deals. Hoffman later appeared on Jake Tapper’s show on CNN and tried to defend himself against accusations of influence peddling. Other tech companies have also been critical of the regulator. Last summer, lawyers for the company then known as Twitter accused Khan’s agency of being biased against the platform and its new owner, Elon Musk. According to Jon Stewart, he was instructed by officials at Apple not to interview Khan during his short-lived Apple TV show, The Problem with Jon Stewart. Amazon once accused Khan of having unfairly “made up her mind” about “Amazon’s antitrust culpability.” It isn’t hard to imagine that other corporate goliaths who have been the subject of FTC scrutiny (like Meta, for instance) are also, presumably not fans of hers. As FTC head, Khan has initiated a number of aggressive actions against the tech industry’s biggest players. Last September, Khan sued Amazon, alleging it had exerted illegal monopoly power over markets that allowed it to inflate prices and reduce product quality. Last year, the FTC under Khan proposed a blanket prohibition on Meta’s monetization of youth data. In 2022, Khan’s FTC sued to disrupt the merger between Microsoft and Blizzard-Activision, though her efforts were ultimately thwarted by a federal judge. The FTC has also sought to unwind Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp (though that effort predates Khan’s tenure with the agency, it has continued under her leadership). Khan has also probed the relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft and expressed concerns for the growing concentration of power within the AI industry, and has sought to spotlight the vast growth of consumer surveillance via adtech in the United States. \nFTCkamala harrisLina Khan  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Musk has spent at least $120 million to get Donald Trump elected.\n         \n          The ads are tied to a dark money group that receives millions from Elon Musk.\n         \n          Trump is currently up just 0.2% over Harris in 538's polling average for Nevada.\n         \n          A social media account claiming to be run by a Black veteran was allegedly tied to a white guy from upstate New York.\n         \n          When her lawn signs kept disappearing, one Missouri woman turned to innovative measures.\n         \n          The FTC's ban on writing, buying, or selling fake reviews is officially in effect.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Polymarket, the platform that allows web users to earn or burn cash via political bets, got spanked by a federal regulator two years ago, which accused it of providing illegal trading services. Since then, as part of its settlement with the government, the site hasn’t allowed Americans to bet on its platform. However, given all the betting related to the U.S. presidential election that’s been happening lately, the business now claims to be investigating whether its anonymous, crypto-swapping users are—as they claim to be—based outside of the U.S. A new report from Bloomberg notes that a “handful of accounts” have “spent millions of dollars worth of crypto on bets in favor of Trump’s return to the White House.” Indeed, the Wall Street Journal recently ran a story on four highly active Polymarket accounts that have been exuberantly betting on the U.S. presidential election. Some observers suspect the accounts may all be run by the same person or group. The accounts are rabidly pro-Trump and have been betting millions of dollars on the U.S. presidential election, thus creating a sense of a surge of popular support for Trump. One source interviewed by the paper intimated that the accounts may be attempting to “generate a sense of momentum for Trump going into Election Day.” Now, Polymarket is beginning to investigate some of its biggest bettors (accounts with names like “Fredi9999” and “FozzyDiablo”) to ensure that there isn’t some irregularity going on. Just how Polymarket plans on ensuring that the people on its platform are, in fact, outside the U.S., is unclear. Frankly, it seems like the site’s defenses would be really easy to fool. Indeed, Bloomberg notes that the platform’s “system for blocking US users can be circumvented by using virtual private networks, and social media is full of instructions on how to do it.” Gizmodo reached out to Polymarket for comment. There are many different political bets on Polymarket, though the most closely watched is the U.S. presidential election. The consensus on the site, of late, has been that Trump will retake the White House. As I write this, the predictor scale at Polymarket shows that 64 percent of the platform’s bettors believe Trump will win, while 35 percent say that Harris will win. There has been more than $2.2 billion in trading activity related to the presidential election this year, Bloomberg writes. However, as should be obvious, the prediction market is only based on online (and, presumably, foreign) sentiment, not on any sort of authentic insider political knowledge or polling information. While they’ve been right in the past, they’ve also been wrong a lot. One critic, Steven Tian, research director of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute, claims that political prediction markets are also “rife with unchecked foreign manipulation,” writing that they can be easily warped by big money and that it is “extremely easy for deep-pocketed foreigners to single-handedly move markets.” \nDonald TrumpPolymarket  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Trump seems to have just two options.\n         \n          The head of one of the world's largest oil companies has had it with government flip-flopping.\n         \n          Biden reversed a controversial decision to relocate the U.S. Space Command to Alabama, but Trump is expected to follow through with his original plan.\n         \n          Time to get your grifts ready.\n         \n          Bryan Johnson recently posted a photo of himself with Robert F.

            "content": "It was going to happen eventually; Gemini AI is making its way to Google Maps. This will give Maps two major capabilities: curating your activities and answering your queries. Suppose your friend is in town, and they message you to link up. To take some pressure off of being the perfect host, you can now ask Google Maps for “things to do in New York City at night with friends” and have it curate and present a list of places that seem most appropriate for your prompt. The list will provide all the important details, such as business hours and pricing. You can always modify your prompt and have it generate new lists. Suppose you spot a place from the list you want to visit. Clicking on it previously gave you its details and a long list of reviews you could scroll through. Now, the Gemini Assistant on Google Maps will summarize all the reviews posted about the establishment. So, you can save time reading people’s sentiments in a few lines at the top of the page. Google Maps can also talk to you like a regular AI assistant does. You will now see a question field where you can ask about a location, such as “Does it have parking?” “Does it have outdoor seating?” or “What is the atmosphere like?” and have it answer all your queries in real-time. This is meant to save you the effort of skimming through the info page of a bar or, worse, scrolling through the reviews to have your query answered. The features above will roll out in the U.S. on Android and iOS this week. The company says review summaries and the option to ask detailed questions about locations will also be coming to Google Search “in the coming months.” To clarify, the Gemini results on Google Maps will be different from if you ask Gemini on its app. The Maps experience is grounded in Maps’ detailed information utilizing insights from millions of contributors to make suggestions for where to go. Those sick of seeing AI recently being stuffed everywhere will not be happy about these updates. But, of course, Google had to inject the greatest app of all time with its AI chatbot. This update also includes a few navigation-based changes. Now, when you enter your destination, you’ll instantly see all the top landmarks, attractions, scenic spots, and dining options along the way. This should save the effort of manually looking those up. Google will now be better at letting you know about upcoming lane merges when you’re out driving. It claims it’ll help you spot crosswalks and road signs with its “enhanced navigation.” You’ll also be able to see and report weather disruptions, such as flooding and unplowed or foggy roads. This one is coming right in time for the winter months ahead. Google is also introducing arrival guidance in its new updates. Arrival guidance is supposed to make sure the route from your parking spot to the door of your destination is sorted. It’ll show you where to park, remind you to save your parking so you don’t forget it, and once you’ve parked, provide walking directions on how to get to the entrance of your destination. The feature to explore your route in advance, see and report weather hazards, and arrival guidance will all start rolling out globally on Android and iOS this week. Expect to see the enhanced navigation feature on Android and iOS next month in over 30 U.S metros, with “plans to expand to more places over time.” Correction: “The Gemini results on Google Maps will be the same as if you ask Gemini on its app. The only big update is that the AI assistant will now live on Maps, so you don’t have to switch between apps.” was changed to “To clarify, the Gemini results on Google Maps will be different from if you ask Gemini on its app. The Maps experience is grounded in Maps’ detailed information utilizing insights from millions of contributors to make suggestions for where to go.”  \nGeminiGoogleGoogle GeminiGoogle Mapsmaps  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          You can say goodbye to the dreaded \"🥲 to 'why the hell aren’t emoji reacts working?’” from iOS to Android with RCS.\n         \n          Conversational search will understand memory and context so you can talk to it like a person.\n         \n          Google accidentally leaked its AI agent on the Chrome extension store but quickly removed it.

            "content": "NASA’s International Space Station (ISS) has been dominating low Earth orbit for more than 25 years, housing groups of astronauts in the microgravity environment. The orbital lab’s time in space, however, will soon come to an end, and NASA is looking for a replacement. California-based company Vast Space recently unveiled its plans to take over the coveted spot left behind by the ISS, revealing the design of its Haven-2 space station. The company is set on proposing its private space station for the second phase of NASA’s Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destinations program (CLD), with plans to launch the first module of Haven-2 in 2028, according to Vast. Vast has been working on Haven-1, which it plans on launching in 2025. The company claims its single-module Haven-1 will be the world’s first commercial space station, capable of hosting short-duration missions for up to four astronauts at a time. But even before its first space station launches, Vast is eyeing that NASA contract to build another one as a commercial successor to the ISS. “Our focus this decade is to win the NASA CLD contract and build the successor to the [ISS],” Max Haot, Vast CEO, said in a statement. “To achieve this, we will first demonstrate our capability by building and operating the world’s first commercial space station, Haven-1.” NASA is planning on retiring the ISS by 2030, sending it flying through Earth’s atmosphere where most of it will burn up from the heat of reentry. In 2021, the space agency created its CLD program to recreate the success of the ISS, but NASA is no longer in the business of building space stations. Instead, it simply wants to be a customer, helping its commercial partners build and operate a space station that NASA can use. Should NASA select Vast to build Haven-2 as the commercial replacement for the ISS, the company plans to launch the first module aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket as early as 2028. With that timeline, there would be a two-year overlap with the ISS in orbit. Following the launch of the first module, Vast wants to build and launch three additional modules over a two-year period. The plan is for the first four modules to be docked in a row, with Vast aiming to launch a larger core module and four additional Haven-2 modules between 2030 and 2032, forming a familiar T-shape in orbit. Haven-2 will feature a lab for microgravity research and in-space manufacturing, as well as a cupola window similar to the one found on the ISS, a robotic arm, an airlock to support the docking of payloads, and another airlock for spacewalks. Vast also intends on dedicating an entire module to international partners. To put its space station design in orbit, Vast will have to compete against other companies also working on their own ISS-replacement, including Axiom Space, Blue Origin, and Northrop Grumman. The company seems confident in its ambitious timeline to operate Haven-2 within the next few years, but NASA will have to be the final judge. Growing Air Leak in Russian Segment Now Deemed Greatest ISS Risk, Report Reveals The space agency is already struggling with the aging space station currently in orbit, with a recent report highlighting the wear and tear all those years of being exposed to the harsh environment of space have had on the ISS. \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n      Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "In between running the most powerful AI company in the world, tech billionaire Sam Altman has a number of side projects. One of them is Worldcoin, the crypto-laced effort to scan the global population’s eyeballs. Why does this need to happen? Worldcoin envisions a new global economic system in which people use unique digital IDs, culled from their iris scans, to pay for stuff online and verify their identities. In a world of bots and AI content, digital IDs will help verify who is human and who isn’t, the project’s backers say. If that sounds cool, it also sounds pretty funny, since it would appear that Altman’s other company, OpenAI, is—by fueling the spread of AI-generated digital fakery—helping to cause the very problem that Worldcoin purports to solve. Anyway, this week, Worldcoin announced a revamp to its business. Not only is the company changing its name (it’s simply called “World” now, the firm’s website states), but it’s also rolling out a brand new “Orb” that is smaller, less bulky, and supposedly faster and more efficient. “The Orb is the incluse, secure and anonymous device that enables World ID holders to verify their humanness and uniqueness,” the company’s blog reads. “In its newest iteration, the Orb is equipped with the most advanced NVIDIA Jetson module with nearly 5x the AI performance over the previous version to enable even faster, more seamless proof of human verifications.” In other words, this version of the Orb is faster and works better. Still, that doesn’t rid the company of its chief problem, which is that people probably don’t want to surrender their biometric data (if only temporarily) to a company that has the same aesthetics and PR tenor as the Delos corporation from Westworld. The updates to the company were announced this week at an event in San Francisco, where Rich Heley, an executive connected to the project said: “To provide access to every human, we need more Orbs. Lots more Orbs. Probably on the order of a thousand times more Orbs than we have today. Not only more Orbs but more Orbs in more places.” More Orbs! When the project first debuted, Gizmodo reviewed the experience of signing up for Worldcoin and found the enterprise to be “boring,” “unquestionably dystopian” and “cynical” —a sentiment others seem to agree with. Worldcoin (er, World now) really hasn’t caught on with the masses quite yet, despite the fact that the company claims it has over 2 million sign-ups, which it achieved by paying people small amounts of crypto. That said, World plans to expand. The company announced this week that it will roll out its dystopic hardware to a number of new countries, including Costa Rica, Brazil, Indonesia, Panama, the UAE, Morocco, Taiwan, Australia, Hungary, and Romania. Despite the company’s promises that it doesn’t store your biometric data and despite the nice and friendly tenor of the company’s advertising materials, and despite the fact that World currently isn’t asking for anything but your participation… it’s still just hard to shake the nagging feeling that we’re all being buttered up for something weird and bad. \nSam Altmanworldcoin  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          OpenAI is going through a rough patch and it's Elon's turn to take revenge.\n         \n          Can thousands of pounds of sulfur dioxide pumped into the stratosphere reverse global warming?

This year, there’s an opportunity to get ahead of the game and set yourself up for significant savings with a Costco Gold Star membership: StackSocial is currently offering a deal that’s hard to resist: a one-year Costco Gold Star membership for just $65, sweetened with a $45 digital gift card. It’s like getting your membership for a mere $20. See at StackSocial This offer is a substantial upgrade from StackSocial’s summer promotion which only included a $20 gift card. The current deal more than doubles that bonus and gives you $45 to spend on anything from Costco’s vast inventory – perhaps even 30 of their famous $1.50 hot dogs, a price point that’s become legendary for its immutability. A Costco Gold Star membership is your key to unlocking savings at over 600 locations across the United States and more than 900 worldwide. This card grants you access to Costco’s treasure trove of deals including their business centers, travel services, gas stations, hearing aid centers, optical departments, pharmacies and their extensive online store. The membership extends its benefits to your household and allows you to share the savings with family members. For those looking to maximize their Costco experience, the Executive membership is available at $130 on StackSocial and offers additional perks and greater discounts on select Costco services. Executive members enjoy benefits like lower prices on check printing and complimentary roadside assistance through the auto insurance program. Perhaps most enticing is the annual 2% reward on qualified Costco purchases up to $1,250. Both membership tiers come with the $45 digital Costco shop card which will be emailed within two weeks of successful redemption. This digital credit isn’t restricted to a single use and you’ll be able to spread your savings across multiple purchases. It’s important to note that this offer is exclusive to new members or those whose memberships have lapsed for more than 18 months. With access to Costco’s competitive pricing on everything from electronics to groceries, members are poised to make substantial savings during the biggest shopping event of the year. The warehouse giant is known for its Black Friday deals often beating out competitors like Amazon or Walmart on popular items like TVs, laptops, and home appliances. Moreover, Costco’s year-round low prices mean that even outside of major sales events, members can consistently save on everyday purchases. From bulk groceries to discounted gift cards for restaurants and entertainment, the potential for savings extends far beyond the holiday season. For those concerned about the upfront cost, it’s worth considering the long-term savings potential. Regular Costco shoppers often find that their membership pays for itself through accumulated savings over the year. With the added $45 gift card in this offer, the break-even point comes even sooner.

            "content": "Walk into the grocery store and check the back of a container of food. Chances are, you’ll see a small box with instructions on how to dispose of the packaging when you’re finished with it: “empty & replace lid,” for example, or “recycle if clean and dry.” These labels are made by How2Recycle, a program operated by the nonprofit GreenBlue, which sells them to more than 700 big food and consumer goods companies to put on their products. The idea behind creating them was to mitigate confusion among consumers about what to do with all the boxes, jars, jugs, and bottles that their purchases are packed in. In recent years, however, companies have come under scrutiny for being too liberal with their use of the iconic “chasing arrows” recycling symbol: It makes plastic bags and other products seem more recyclable than they really are. Regulators have taken notice. At the national level, the Federal Trade Commission is preparing an update to its “Green Guides” for the use of sustainability labels, including the recycling symbol. And in California, state law is expected to restrict the chasing arrows for most packaging made of plastic, unless there’s evidence that the plastic is widely collected and turned into new products within the state. How2Recycle’s program, created to help clear up this mess, is coming under fire now, too Earlier this month, GreenBlue announced it was revamping its more-than-a-decade-old How2Recycle labels. During a presentation at SPC Advance, a conference organized by one of GreenBlue’s subsidiaries, Paul Nowak, GreenBlue’s executive director, said the labels need to “evolve with the world around us,” taking into account factors like “policy” and “recycling rates.” Based on a sample image of the new labels, however, it’s not clear whether GreenBlue’s updates will address concerns that they’re tools for so-called greenwashing, or that they comply with state law. Because there’s no evidence that some of the products set to feature the new designs are actually recycled most of the time, the labels might violate California’s rules against deceptive advertising and put GreenBlue at risk of lawsuits from state regulators and consumer advocacy organizations. The proposed labels are “an obvious and transparent attempt by industry to circumvent California law,” said Howie Hirsch, a retired lawyer in California who has worked on several recycling-related deceptive advertising lawsuits. Hirsch specifically objects to GreenBlue’s label for “store drop-off,” which instructs customers to deposit plastic bags in grocery store take-back bins so they can be collected for recycling. Currently, this label features the words “store drop-off” inside a triangular chasing arrows symbol — giving the inaccurate impression that this plastic is likely to be recycled. A revised version of that label, shared in Nowak’s presentation, simply changes the arrows’ path: Instead of chasing each other around a triangle, they now chase each other around a circle. According to Hirsch, that small change isn’t enough to comply with California law. First, one section of the California Business and Professions Code says that the chasing arrows triangle is functionally equivalent to — and subject to the same truth-in-labeling restrictions as — the circular version proposed by GreenBlue. The law applies to any variant of the symbol that is “likely to be interpreted by a consumer as an implication of recyclability” — including “one or more arrows arranged in a circular pattern or around a globe.” Another part of California’s law referring to the FTC’s Green Guides requires the corroboration of recyclability claims: Companies that label their products with the chasing arrows have to provide evidence that they are, in fact, widely collected for recycling and turned into new products within California. Plastic bag manufacturers have not provided such evidence, and they are under investigation from the California attorney general’s office after failing to do so. The circular chasing arrows “seems to be just the kind of thing that we were hoping to push back against,” said California State Senator Ben Allen, a Democrat who sponsored a landmark bill to reign in the misleading use of the recycling symbol that became law in 2022. A separate law passed last month will phase out plastic grocery bags offered to California shoppers at checkout. But many other types of plastic bags and thin-film plastic will still be allowed. Jan Dell, an independent chemical engineer and founder of the nonprofit The Last Beach Cleanup, would like to see How2Recycle’s store drop-off labels disappear altogether. Store drop-off is “a hoax,” she told Grist via email. “All credible data, independent experts, and many tracker studies prove that it is impossible to collect, sort, and recycle post-household consumer flexible plastic waste” on a meaningful scale. According to an analysis Dell conducted in 2020, California only has the capacity to sort and recycle about 1 percent of its waste generated from plastic bags and film. Nationwide tracker studies from Bloomberg and ABC News — using Apple AirTags or similar devices — have shown that plastic bags deposited in store drop-off receptacles are more likely to end up in a landfill or incinerator than at a recycling facility. Allen’s truth-in-labeling law will soon add even more specific requirements for the chasing arrows and other symbols like it. Starting 18 months after the state’s recycling agency publishes a report on the recyclability of various materials, companies will have to show that products labeled as recyclable through a non-curbside program — like at a grocery store — are collected at a rate of 60 percent or higher, and then sorted and recycled within the state. That threshold will bump up to 75 percent in 2030. Recent analyses suggest it’s unlikely that any types of plastic bags or film will meet those high standards. In 2020, the Flexible Packaging Association said the U.S. recycling rate for post-consumer film and flexible plastic packaging was just 2 percent. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for a circular economy, estimates that “near 0 percent” of flexible plastics sold to consumers around the world is recycled; what little recycling that does happen involves turning polyethylene film into “applications of lower material quality” like plastic decking and trash bags. “As soon as flexible packaging waste is generated it is incredibly hard to deal with,” the foundation’s report says. As a first order of business, it recommends eliminating “unnecessary” plastic products. In response to Grist’s request for comment, a spokesperson for GreenBlue said the organization is reviewing its proposal for new labels with government agencies, including the FTC and state attorneys general, “to ensure that pairing the label’s symbol with additional clarifying information would constitute a thoroughly substantiated claim.” “If regulators deem the label not in compliance with California’s SB 343,” the spokesperson added, “How2Recycle will pursue a different label design.” A spokesperson for the California Attorney General’s office declined to comment on the How2Recycle labels and would not confirm whether the office had spoken with GreenBlue. The FTC did not respond to Grist’s request for comment. Allen, the California state senator, said the plastics industry’s time would be better spent redesigning products and eliminating unnecessary packaging to comply with recent laws, instead of fiddling with labels. In addition to the truth-in-labeling regulation, as of 2022, California has an extended producer responsibility law requiring companies to meet elevated recycling targets for certain types of products. “If they’ve got a real plan to fundamentally revamp recycling in this space, then I’m interested in hearing about it,” Allen said. “But claiming recyclability or encouraging people to do something that they know they’re never going to do in a meaningful way” — like dropping off bags at a store — “it’s greenwashing and it’s a joke, and I just don’t want us to allow for it.

            "content": "TurboTax’s parent company Intuit has stepped in it after its CEO Sasan Saeedi got into a somewhat confrontational exchange during an interview with The Verge for its Decoder podcast.  Saeedi was pressed by the outlet’s editor-in-chief Nilay Patel over Intuit’s efforts to prevent a simplification of tax filing in the United States. It’s a pretty obvious thing to ask about: Intuit is one of the most notorious lobbyists in Washington because of its efforts over the years to prevent tax filing from becoming simpler and cheaper.  Following the interview, however, Intuit’s head of communications contacted The Verge to ask that the testy exchange be cut from the interview, or otherwise heavily edited to make it seem less confrontational, such as by removing portions where they are talking over one another.  Here’s one excerpt from the controversial exchange (Patel’s comments bolded):  Wait. The simplest version of taxes is the government just sends you a return and it’s done, and Intuit has lobbied against that. Would you support the government just doing the taxes for people and sending the refunds? At the end of the day, you have — Many countries in the world do that. Yeah, but you have to change the tax system. It’s not about software. So if we change the tax system, where — Are you going to lobby to change the tax system to let the government do a filing for you and send people checks? If government wants to change the tax system — But I’m asking you, you’re spending the dollars, would you lobby for it? Lobby for the government changing the tax system? The simplest version of the tax system would be to just have the government do it and send people their refunds or ask people for money. I have more important things to do than to lobby the government to send a tax bill. But you have lobbied against that. That’s what I’m saying. That reporting is clear. You’ve lobbied against… Intuit, it is not you. Intuit has lobbied against that very specifically. Well, I am Intuit, right? And so it’s okay to put me and Intuit in the same verse. We have very much focused on simplifying taxes. That’s what we lobbied for: simplify the tax code. That’s simply what we’ve lobbied for. Any outside observer can understand that the request to cut this interview portion would only draw more attention to that section of the interview. It’s really the only thing people will likely take away from the interview now, even though it’s only a small portion of the episode and Saeedi’s responses weren’t terrible. He effectively said that TurboTax is always looking to raise awareness of its free product, and that it won’t lobby to eliminate tax filing entirely because why would it?  The head of communications for a $171 billion company should know that this request was a bad idea, and The Verge published an article specifically about the situation. Sometimes tougher questions feel more contentious than they actually are. But for readers, the interview probably feels more genuine and relatable with that back-and-forth exchange that hasn’t been smoothed over or approved by a public relations team trying to make its CEO look good. It’s too heavy-handed. And running TurboTax as CEO is Saeedi’s entire day-to-day job, he should be able to handle some questions about its practices.  For a little more context, TurboTax partnered with the IRS years ago to make free tax filing software available to low-income Americans, in a sort of goodwill gesture intended to maintain the current tax filing regime. Intuit, of course, does not want all tax filing to be automated away as TurboTax is one of its most profitable offerings. But it was ostensibly willing to make filing free for low-income Americans so it could continue to charge upper-class and small business customers.  Unfortunately, any goodwill Intuit may have earned was thrown out when it was discovered the company tried to deceive the American public through a technical sleight of hand. It famously got slapped with a major fine in 2022 after reporting found Intuit was using robots.txt files to prevent Google from indexing links to its truly free product, instead sending low-income consumers through the funnel to a paid offering. After that, the IRS basically threw up its hands and decided to make its own software.   Intuit has been strongly opposed to the IRS making its own software for free tax filing. The company spent $3.8 million in 2023 lobbying against the IRS’s Direct File software, which was made available for the first time in 2024 in a limited number of states. For now, the software is limited to lower-income Americans who do not have complicated taxes.  Early on the in year, Intuit sent a scathing statement to OpenSecrets about Direct File: “Direct File is not free tax preparation, but rather a thinly veiled scheme where billions of taxpayer dollars will be unnecessarily used to pay for something already completely free of charge today — free to the taxpayer and actually free for the government,” Intuit’s spokesperson Tania Mercado told OpenSecrets, emphasizing that the program “could end up wasting billions of taxpayer dollars.” The software that’s “already completely free of charge today” is, of course, TurboTax. But Intuit is not a charitable organization, there’s a reason it offers free tax filing to some Americans. It’s a cover to continue a regime of charging others for tax preparation when what everyone really wants is free, automated filing. Anyone who’s worked a regular 9-5 job understands that the IRS knows how much you make anyway. Just automate it already. \nSasan Saeediturbotax  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n      Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

Disney is continuing with its trend of nice, 4K UHD steelbook releases of its original streaming shows, just in case the House of Mouse ever decides to go on another Disney+ deletion spree. Bad news! The time has come to ask ourselves the most enduring of questions: is The Mandalorian season 3 worth more of your hard-earned dollars beyond a Disney+ subscription? Today Disney announced that its latest round of UHD steelbook releases will bring another four seasons of TV to physical release later this year. The latest round includes two Star Wars and two Marvel offerings: The Mandalorian completes its current run with the arrival of season 3 alongside Ahsoka‘s debut season, while the MCU offers Hawkeye season one and Loki season 2. As has been the trend with these releases, the steelbooks come with new artwork, art cards, and a round of bonus features for each release (with plenty more on offer for the two Marvel shows, including deleted scenes). Here’s the individual breakdown for each release: It’ll be nice, at least, that ahead of The Mandalorian & Grogu‘s release next year the complete story of Din and Grogu will be available physically (well, give or take a few episodes of The Book of Boba Fett). That’s just about the only nice thing about the prospect of revisiting The Mandalorian‘s aimless third season at least, as the show wandered around reverting many of the interesting choices it had made across its first two seasons to deliver a show that left us with a lot more questions than any tangible answers, including if this was all worth ultimately scuppering the narrative of two shows to get us ready for what’s next. That will be a question we ultimately see answered on the big screen, but for now, you can prepare yourself when the 4K UHD releases of The Mandalorian Season 3, Ahsoka Season 1, Hawkeye Season 1, and Loki Season 2 go up for pre-order on October 31, ahead of a US release December 3.

A feature in Bloomberg goes deep into the technology, who is funding it, and what the consequences might be. The planet is getting hotter and the disastrous effects of that warming are no longer theoretical, they’re here now. Worse, climate experts have warned that we may be well past the point of no return. Any action by the world’s governments to fix this problem would need to be immediate and dramatic. That’s probably not going to happen. Faced with that kind of dilemma, rich people are thinking about taking matters into their own hands—and soon. “I wish the world were studying solar geoengineering more,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a post on X. “Clearly have misgivings about it, but it’s so relatively cheap that I think some country is just going to do it if/when the climate crisis gets bad enough as a temporary patch. Would be great to learn more before then.” Bill Gates, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, VC execs Matt Cohler and Chris Sacca, and Bay area billionaire Rachel Pritzker are all investing in companies that seek to block out the sun. According to a spokesperson, former Meta CTO Mike Schroepfer is funding the non-profit Outlier Projects which supports “research on sunlight reflection, alongside other climate research, all with the aim of understanding what options might help mitigate the worst effects of climate change.” How, exactly, would this work? As Altman pointed out in his post, it’s cheap and easy. A startup called Make Sunsets is already out there doing it. “Some may call it solar engineering—we call it an opportunity to reverse global warming,” its website says. Make Sunsets’ solution is solar radiation management (SRM), which involves reflecting sunlight to cool the planet. There are a couple of ways to do this, but one of the easiest is called stratospheric aerosol injection. It involves flying a jet around the planet that dumps sulfur dioxide into the air. In theory, the SO2 would blanket the stratosphere, reflect sunlight away from the planet, and gradually cool the Earth. According to its website, this solution mimics the effects of a volcanic eruption. “Emissions from volcanic eruptions have been cooling the Earth for millions of years, like Mt. Pinatubo in 1991. We are simply mimicking Mother Nature,” the site says. What are the downsides to this? There are many. According to the company’s FAQ, the effect is uncertain, it may deplete the ozone layer, if it’s ever stopped the Earth may rapidly heat back up, it could lead to a perception that the world has “fixed” climate change, and it “could lead to geopolitical tensions and disagreements about its deployment, regulation, and potential side effects.” Right now they’re doing it with balloons. Interested individuals and companies can purchase “cooling credits” from Make Sunsets at $10 a pop or at a subscription rate of $30 a month for 30. “One Cooling Credit offsets one ton of CO2 warming for a year. The average American generates 16 tons of CO2 per year,” Make Sunsets says on its website. “By purchasing a Cooling Credit, your funds will be used to release at least 1 gram of our ‘clouds’ into the stratosphere on your behalf, offsetting the warming effect of 1 ton of carbon dioxide for 1 year.” According to Bloomberg, other cooling startups and NGOs see Make Sunsets as a bit ridiculous. “You need a regulatory function that works and you need lots of science. Right now, we don’t have either of those things,” Kelly Wanser, the founder of SilverLining—a nonprofit that’s tackling climate change—told Bloomberg. As the planet heats up, the plots will only get more ridiculous. It’s hard to blame the world’s billionaires for wanting to spend some part of their vast fortune to protect their investments. The governments of the world have made it clear that they aren’t up to the challenge. As Altman said, it’s possible that someone with a lot of money will be persuaded to do something very big and very weird after a major climate event in the near future. Andrew Lockley, a UK-based independent researcher in geoengineering told Bloomberg: “To get started it only takes one person to say, ’I have 100 million quid, I have a business jet, let’s go.’” There’s no shortage of startups and NGOs out there willing to take their money for a radical and unproven solution. In Highlander II, protagonist Connor MacLeod is filled with the sum of all human knowledge. He uses that power to solve a pressing problem, the Earth’s rapidly diminishing ozone layer. He does this by building a giant shield encasing the entire planet. It saves us but dooms the world to darkness, heat, and humidity. It’s miserable. In the end, he destroys the shield and gives the world back the sky. Highlander II sucks. It’s a bad movie. And it’s awful that years of dragging our feet on climate change have created the conditions where some of its ludicrous plot points may become reality. Correction October 29: A previous version of this article identified former Meta CTO Mike Schroepfer as an investor in a for-profit solar geoengineering company. Schroepfer funds the non-profit Outlier Projects.

            "content": "Have you ever watched a TV series and, about halfway through an episode, instantly knew this was special? That this was the episode where a show you were enjoying leveled up to become a modern classic? The Last of Us did that. Battlestar Galactica. Lost. All the great ones do it. And now The Penguin has done it too. The show’s fourth episode, “Cent’anni,” flips the entire emotional resonance of the show with a shocking, horrific, but brilliant episode of television centering on Sofia Falcone (Cristin Milioti) and, holy crap. It’s amazing. Before this episode, we weren’t quite sure what to think of Sofia. We knew that she was in Arkham because she’d been accused of killing several women, which earned her the nickname “The Hangman.” We knew Oz (Colin Farrell) was afraid of her, but we assumed it was mostly because she was the head of the family he was trying to take over. And, we thought, Oz had successfully convinced her he didn’t kill her brother, even though he did. Basically, The Penguin wanted us to see Sofia as an intimidating but emotionally unstable and malleable villain. No more. Now that we’ve learned exactly who she is and how she got there, she’s clearly become the most interesting character on the show.  At the end of the last episode, “Bliss,” we saw Victor smash his car to save Sofia and Oz from the Maroni crime family. Only, Oz told Victor to leave Sofia, which at the time seemed weird because they’d been aligned. Well, in the first fantastic bit of storytelling in episode four, we learn that Sofia is finally told it was Oz who killed her brother, so his abandoning her becomes a whole other thing. It’s a revelation we assumed was coming at some point but to find out this way added some interesting context. But that was just the beginning. From there, we dive into the past where we meet a younger, happier Sofia along with her father, crime boss Carmine Falcone (played here by Mark Strong, who took over for John Turturro who played the character in The Batman), and her brother, Alberto (Michael Zegen). The family seems pretty happy and Carmine even tells Sofia that, despite her older brother, he’s going to leave the family business to her. Big House of the Dragon vibes. Of course that doesn’t go to plan. Sofia finds out that someone—later revealed to be her father—has been killing women and covering up the crimes as suicide, going all the way back to Sofia and Alberto’s mother. Sofia learns this in what she assumes to be private but her driver, Oz, rats her out. It’s a betrayal to be sure—but at this point, you’re still seeing it from Oz’s perspective. It’s not until later that we realize Oz was the one who started an unfathomable chain of events for Sofia. Based on Oz’s intel, Carmine confronts Sofia about her findings and, when she even hints that maybe her dad killed the women, everything changes. He frames her for the murders, sends her to Arkham, and makes it so she’ll never ever get out. Having her father betray her so quickly and brutally was pretty bad. But when we learn that Sofia’s entire family—minus her brother—lied about her mental condition to keep her there, you truly feel terrible for her. Then, you feel worse and worse as the episode goes full Requiem for a Dream with the doctors and inmates of Arkham also seemingly in on the plan to make the levelheaded, smart Sofia into the violent, crazy murderer her father lies about. The violence and betrayal seem never-ending and, later, we learn it went on for 10 years. As we watch the innocent Sofia endure both mental and physical horrors—all of which started with Oz—your perspective starts to shift. Is Oz really the main character of this story because he’s a famous Batman villain? He’s just a former driver grasping for power. Or is the main character the rightful heir to the throne, betrayed by almost everyone she loved, who fights her way out of hell to come back? That’s, by far, the more interesting story. And once The Penguin comes out of the flashback and back to the present, it’s a different show. Now we are on Sofia’s side. We want to see her get revenge. We’re enraged that Oz killed Alberto, the one family member who believed in and fought for Sofia. We’re desperate for her to get revenge on her aunts and uncles, and boy does she, with a fantastic final scene as she murders almost everyone in the house without lifting a finger. Chef’s kiss. Written by John McCutcheon and directed by Helen Shave, “Cent’anni” isn’t just the best episode yet of The Penguin, it’s one of the best episodes of TV of the year. This write-up barely scratches the surface of all the fantastic choices it makes (the wallpaper! The fork! The cake!) or, most importantly, Milioti’s performance which is absolutely award-worthy. In fact, the episode was so good, I’m now fully Team Sofia. They should rename the show “Falcone.” The Penguin is now streaming on Max. Want more io9 news?

            "content": "In the latest news of surprise business acquisitions and mergers that make sense at first glance, Toho Animation, the self-proclaimed leader in Japanese entertainment, has announced its acquisition of Gkids, a North American animation producer and distributor. Earlier today, Gkids published a press release describing its acquisition by the Los Angeles-based Toho as one where Toho would acquire 100% equity from Gkids. At the same time, the other would maintain its independence (and folks in power as CEOs and whatnot) while utilizing Toho’s connections to bolster its commerce and further its reach in the entertainment world. What does all that mean to the average fan of Japanese entertainment and anime? Two mega powers in the industry are combining forces to compete against other companies that are jockeying for our precious attention, such as Disney. A key motivator behind Toho and Gkids’ partnership is the winning success both companies experienced at the box office this past year with Godzilla Minus One and Hayao Miyazaki’s The Boy and the Heron. As Gkids states in its press release, both films earned significant achievements within a week of each other, with the former earning the highest box office revenue for a Japanese live-action film in the states and the third largest-grossing foreign film in U.S. history, and the latter becoming Studio Ghibli’s highest-grossing film in the U.S. And even beyond that, the two aren’t strangers to one another, having collaborated with the theatrical releases of animated films like Spirited Away: Live on Stage, Makoto Shinkai’s Weathering With You, and animation Studio Trigger’s Promare. Reading between Gkids’ press release lines, the two likely decided to perform a fusion dance of sorts after making their presences felt during the most recent awards season (including the Oscars). To put one’s capitalistic cap on, the two aim to have their combined forces lead to a repeat of their individual successes with the aforementioned award-winning films as a united front. “Gkids will continue to operate as we always have—with the same team, the same passion, and the same mission—but now with the backing of a highly complementary and legendary parent company,” Gkids founder Eric Beckman and president David Jesteadt wrote in a joint statement. “This partnership will empower us to bring even more amazing films to North American and global audiences, while we continue to champion animation as a cinematic artform and push the limits of what the medium is capable of. We could not be more excited about the opportunities in front of us. The best is yet to come.” While Toho has become a household name for many an anime fan thanks to big marquee shonen series like Dragon Ball Z and Jujutsu Kaisen, Gkids has become a bit of a rising star in the cultural zeitgeist. Its North American theatrical distribution and home video releases of Look Back, Dan Da Dan, The First Slam Dunk, and Arcane season one are the most recent money-move examples of Gkids putting itself on the map for fans of Japanese entertainment and animation. Likewise, Toho has been on a future-sighted acquisition spree, recently taking on Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, Dan Da Dan, and Devilman Crybaby animation studio Science Saru. “Through their hard work, vision, and integrity, Gkids has built a unique position in the U.S. market, which dovetails perfectly with Toho’s own strengths and strategic mission,” Toho president and CEO Hiro Matsuoka wrote in the press release. “This partnership accelerates Toho’s goals to prioritize animation, develop international markets, and support IP creation, while bringing exceptional Japanese and animated content to global audiences.” Hopefully, this no-brainer acquisition doesn’t lead to an influx of layoffs across Toho or Gkids, as we’ve seen countless times in the video game industry. In the meantime, the likes of Disney and Netflix can look forward to steep competition at both the box office and during awards season. Want more io9 news?

            "content": "Taking a firm stance against tech companies’ unlicensed use of its authors’ works, the publishing giant Penguin Random House will change the language on all of its books’ copyright pages to expressly prohibit their use in training artificial intelligence systems, according to reporting by The Bookseller. It’s a notable departure from other large publishers, such as academic printers Taylor & Francis, Wiley, and Oxford University Press, which have all agreed to license their portfolios to AI companies. Matthew Sag, an AI and copyright expert at Emory University School of Law, said Penguin Random House’s new language appears to be directed at the European Union market but could also impact how AI companies in the U.S. use its material. Under EU law, copyright holders can opt-out of having their work data mined. While that right isn’t enshrined in U.S. law, the largest AI developers generally don’t scrape content behind paywalls or content excluded by sites’ robot.txt files. “You would think there is no reason they should not respect this kind of opt out [that Penguin Random House is including in its books] so long as it is a signal they can process at scale,” Sag said. Dozens of authors and media companies have filed lawsuits in the U.S. against Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, and other AI developers accusing them of violating the law by training large language models on copyrighted work. The tech companies argue that their actions fall under the fair use doctrine, which allows for the unlicensed use of copyrighted material in certain circumstances—for example, if the derivative work substantially transforms the original content or if it’s used for criticism, news reporting, or education. U.S. Courts haven’t yet decided whether feeding a book into a large language model constitutes fair use. Meanwhile, social media trends in which users post messages telling tech platforms not to train AI models on their content have been predictably unsuccessful. Penguin Random House’s no-training message is a bit different from those optimistic copypastas. For one thing, social media users have to agree to a platform’s terms of service, which invariably allows their content to be used to train AI. For another, Penguin Random House is a wealthy international publisher that can back up its message with teams of lawyers. The Bookseller reported that the publisher’s new copyright pages will read, in part: “No part of this book may be used or reproduced in any manner for the purpose of training artificial intelligence technologies or systems. In accordance with Article 4(3) of the Digital Single Market Directive 2019/790, Penguin Random House expressly reserves this work from the text and data mining exception.” Tech companies are happy to mine the internet, particularly sites like Reddit, for language datasets but the quality of that content tends to be poor—full of bad advice, racism, sexism, and all the other isms, contributing to bias and inaccuracies in the resulting models. AI researchers have said that books are among the most desirable training data for models due to the quality of writing and fact-checking. If Penguin Random House can successfully wall off its copyrighted content from large language models it could have a significant impact on the generative AI industry, forcing developers to either start paying for high-quality content—which would be a blow to business models reliant on using other people’s work for free—or try to sell customers on models trained on low-quality internet content and outdated published material.  “The endgame for companies like Penguin Random House opting out of AI training may be to satisfy the interests of authors who are opposed to their works being used as training data for any reason, but it is probably so that the publishing company can turn around and [start] charging license fees for access to training data,” Sag said. “If this is the world we end up in, AI companies will continue to train on the ‘open Internet’ but anyone who is in control of a moderately large pile of text will want to opt out and charge for access. That seems like a pretty good compromise which lets publishers and websites monetize access without creating impossible transaction costs for AI training in general.” \nAiBooksPenguin Random House  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          'I would love to say that it’s going to make things cheaper, quicker, better, or easier to make hits.
