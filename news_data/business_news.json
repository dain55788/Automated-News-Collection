The “True Sensation” dildo is a fleshy, silicone tool that measures exactly 7 inches and has the ability to vibrate (three different frequencies), thrust (seven different speeds), and self-heat (up to 105 degrees Fahrenheit). It’s just like the real thing, James Guo, the founder of Our Erotic Journey, assures me from his office in Irvine, California. Best of all—everything is controlled through the app AMZ. “It connects to someone that’s oceans away,” he says of its potential for creating all kinds of sexual fantasies. Teasingly, he adds: “There’s also music that can match the intensity of the vibration.” True Sensation is just one offering featured among the wide inventory of Our Erotic Journey, the sex toy brand Guo launched in 2019. Its online store, which boasts more than 200 products, is a pleasure chest of sexual self-amusement. Take your pick: There’s the lipstick-shaped vibrator, a remote-controlled rotating butt plug, various cock rings, something called the “Gravity Rocket” (a clitoral suction vibrator with seven massage modes), and a smattering of glow-in-the-dark accessories. “Those are for the ravers,” Guo jokes. The sex tech market is estimated to triple by 2030, exceeding $100 billion globally in sales. The demand for products, from AI-assisted companions and personal wand massagers to sexual wellness apps, sits at an all-time high. At a moment when industry trends favor artificial intelligence and remote sex exploration, Guo just wants to make eccentric, high-quality vibrators. He’s betting big on toys. In the years since launch, Guo has built Our Erotic Journey into a quietly influential brand through intentionally whimsical designs and an insistence on quality products. “I know production,” Guo says. His family, he tells me, owns an auto-parts factory in China, and what he learned from the business—how the factory system runs, the science of machines, what style of packaging attracts customers—he leveraged for OEJ. Guo admits that the initial product line—about 20 toys, of which the Sec Duo vibrator for couples remains a company best-seller—was devised to “fit the market.” “We self developed the first batch through modding, R&D, scaling, all that stuff,” he says. “Everything since that represents more of who we are.” That’s how OEJ’s six themed collections came to be. The Cristal collection is for glass toys while the Space, Thrillz, and Lit collections are for truly uninhibited pleasure seekers (one features a dildo called “The Girthquake,” that exploits a specific, if sometimes worn out, racial fantasy). But where Guo, who is 35, sometimes falls short in imagination, he more than makes up for in vigilance. “Users expect and deserve products that meet stringent safety standards, and any deviation can damage a brand’s reputation irrevocably,” he posted in an XBIZ editorial in September. “Partner with trusted white-label manufacturers rather than gamble on the unknowns.” When I ask Guo about the editorial, he stresses that the success of sex tech is determined as much by the innovation involved in the products as the quality. “We want to be more of a bridge from human to human,” Guo says, “not just from toy to human.” Even with promising market projections—another estimate goes so far as to predict sales could surpass $121 billion by 2030—industry analysts are not convinced that the future of sex tech is in toys. It’s a “very oversaturated market that is now avoided by many,” says Olena Petrosyuk, a partner at the consulting firm Waveup. This year, she adds, investors “are looking away from ‘commoditized’ trends”—sex toys, but also sex content and social platforms. “Many failed to prove the economics and scale. The category is still fairly stigmatized,” she says. “OnlyFans being a massive exception.” So what do consumers want? Petrosyuk says wellness, AI, and immersive realities are hot right now. “Practically every new sex tech startup is thinking in terms of AI use cases,” she says. “If it’s AI toys—companies are looking into how they can anticipate and respond to the user’s needs. If it’s robotics—we see companies looking into sex bots. If it’s content—it’s hyperpersonalized sex personas.” Guo tells me he is not phased by talk of AI sex robots—“a low-volume business,” in his estimation—because many people cannot afford the high price tag. Steady growth, he believes, will happen by expanding on the company’s themed collections. Next year, OEJ plans to launch a Zodiac collection, crafting 12 unique toys for each astrological sign. It’s an appeal to the Co–Star fanatics of Gen Z. “Every generation is different,” he says. The company’s mostly nonexistent social media presence only seems to add to their Wonka-like mystery. “We’re just bad at it,” Jerry Chen, an operations assistant, admits. “We’re really focused on production.” OEJ works directly with US and Canadian distributors; it is not a direct-to-consumer business, though Guo says customers do occasionally order via the online store. Even as ecommerce has become the industry standard in retail and electronics, taking more of an old-school approach works for Guo. For now, that business model seems to be a hit. Our Erotic Journey recently won the “Best Pleasure Product Manufacturer—Small” prize at the 2023–2024 AVN Awards in Las Vegas, a litmus test for newbie brands in the adult content world. OEJ also received the O Award for Outstanding New Product for “Sexy Pot,” a marijuana-leaf-shaped vibrator, and a customer favorite. Clearly wanting to capitalize on its unexpected success, Guo says, “It’s time we gave it a sister or brother.” In your inbox: A new series of tips for how to use AI every day Meet the masked vigilante tracking down billions in crypto scams Deep dive: This app set out to fight pesticides.

            "content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Ambition is not a dirty word—especially if you’re Bertrand Piccard. The explorer, psychiatrist, and environmentalist aims to “promote sustainability through spectacular actions” to prove that a cleaner future is possible. During 2015 and 2016, he famously circumnavigated the globe in a solar-powered airplane, Solar Impulse, to show off the potential of renewables. But even more ambitious was what he attempted after he landed. He tasked his foundation with demonstrating that environmental protection and economic profit can go hand in hand. The goal was to find 1,000 interventions that can protect the planet while also making money, shattering the argument that pursuing sustainability must come at a cost. “The goal is really to show that we can be much more efficient, that we can develop the economy, but in a clean way,” Piccard says. It’s going well. Since the foundation started its project eight years ago, it has logged 1,650 solutions—processes, products, materials, and devices—that can make an environmental difference at a profit. They encompass nearly every field—from water and energy to agriculture and IT—and the foundation is working to bring them to governments, cities, and businesses. Ahead of speaking at the WIRED x Octopus Energy Tech Summit in Berlin on October 10, Piccard sat down with WIRED to discuss how Solar Impulse’s program works, who’s responsible for making positive change happen, and why the narrative around net zero needs to change. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. WIRED: Tell us about these profitable solutions. They sound almost too good to be true. Bertrand Piccard: Sure. To be selected, a solution needs to exist already. And it needs to be credible, scalable, and profitable, and to protect the environment. So for example, there is a system of steel staples produced by a Belgian company called Bekaert. Mix these inside concrete when building and you don’t need all these heavy and expensive iron armatures. With the staples you keep the concrete more compact and end up using less concrete and metal, producing less CO2 and pollution, and making more profit. Another example are LED lamps that you can use for public lighting, where you can have a solar panel and battery. The lighting is then off-grid. You don’t need to dig along the street to put in wires. If you do that, you save 37 percent of the energy bill of the city. You have interesting ways to take the unrecyclable waste of a city and turn it into construction stones. You have ways to recover the lost heat from factory chimneys and give it back to the factory—it’s then 20 to 40 percent less on the energy bill. In a city, you can dig channels for geothermal heat, and connect big buildings with heat pumps in the center of the city to this network. This was not possible five years ago; now you can do it. Once you’ve discovered these ideas, how do you get them adopted? Is it about spreading knowledge? Providing funding? We give our label—the Solar Impulse Efficient Solution label—to those that deserve it. It’s the only label that certifies the economic profitability of an ecological product, material, system, or device. This helps these companies developing solutions find investors, customers, and partners. We help the companies directly, too. We put them in contact with investors. We also have created two investment funds, with BNP Paribas and Rothschild Five Arrows, to bring investments in to help companies develop. We also organize meetings between public authorities and innovators, so that companies can find customers—we bring together the people providing solutions with those needing them. This approach suggests we can innovate our way out of trouble, but some argue that behavior change is really what’s needed to stop environmental destruction. Flying is a good example—that instead of banking on carbon-free flights becoming possible, some say we should just fly less. What do you think of this argument? I think we need to always reconcile both ways of thinking. You have to clearly degrow pollution, waste, and consumption of resources and energy. But you cannot degrow the economy. You need to pay for education, health, social protection. It can seem to be a paradox—but it’s not. We are in a quantitative economy where we produce and waste too much. We need to move to a qualitative economy, where you replace what is polluting with what is protecting the environment, by selling efficiency. If you sell systems that reabsorb the heat from the chimney or public parking or subways to heat houses, you save energy, but at the same time, you create jobs and you help startups to develop. What you always have to aim for is efficiency: Do better with less. This is possible in a lot of fields. Now, you asked me a specific question about aviation. There is too much consumption here because the cost is so low. A lot of people fly because it is cheap. And again, we have massive quantitative consumption. We have to go back to a more selective, qualitative way of flying. But at the same time, we need to develop decarbonized aviation, because the world is not ready to stop flying completely. What other big areas still need grappling with? There are solutions for every field, but the problem is we don’t use them. You can have construction that is almost carbon-neutral, but a lot of buildings are still made in an old-fashioned way. Decarbonization of construction is completely possible, but you need 10 percent more investment at the beginning. Of course, you recover this over the years because the operating costs are much lower. But you need a model where constructors receive an incentive to build with higher initial investment to the lower operating cost. Mobility can be electric. But to really justify electric cars that drive only 5 percent of the day, you need to use their batteries to store energy off the grid, and then when there’s a peak of demand, have them discharge their batteries. For this, you need to clearly give an advantage to all EV drivers to be able to store energy and sell it back to the grid. This is not done yet. You could use data centers to heat a city. But it’s not done. So everywhere, solutions exist, and we need to push the knowledge that these solutions are profitable, they exist, and they protect the environment. What role do governments play in this? It is still allowed today to be inefficient. It’s still allowed to put CO2 in the atmosphere and plastic into the oceans. So, we need to modernize the legal framework in order to really push the legal need to be efficient. If it is a necessity to use all these solutions, people will use them, and they will come much more onto the market and it will help the startups grow, produce all these solutions for everybody, and it will be a major advantage. So governments have a very important responsibility. What about finance? That must be important too. Something that’s key, I think, are new business models that sell use and not property. So, for example, you have people who want to install a heat pump system in a building—they will make a contract with a producer of heat pumps to buy heat over 20 years, but the pump still belongs to the producer, not the final client, which means that there needs to be a financial institution that pays for it. And this is a business opportunity. There will be much more leasing than direct sales in the future. Another example that I love very much is a company called Pragma Charge. Big transport companies usually use diesel trucks; Pragma Charge, instead of trying to sell these companies replacement EVs, which are more expensive, sells a service: kilometers of transport with electric trucks. So the company doesn’t have to handle the energy transition, it just gets the final product? Exactly, yes. India has done it too with electric buses. The government has bought 50,000 electric buses and put them in different cities and villages. But these places don’t have to buy the vehicles, they only buy the kilometers driven—and this works out 25 percent cheaper than it would be using diesel buses. We have the goal of getting to net zero by 2050. How confident are you that we’ve got the tools to achieve this? We are not on the path to get there. And I think the narrative used is wrong. We hear it’s going to be difficult. We hear it’s going to be expensive, that people will have to make sacrifices and renounce a part of their comfort and mobility. I think it’s the wrong narrative because it is not attractive. In Europe, a lot of political parties and individuals are resisting this goal of decarbonization, thinking it’s detrimental for them, for their business. But if instead you tell people we are going to modernize our country, have more efficient infrastructure and systems, they will be enthusiastic. Instead of speaking of the cost of the energy transition, you have to speak about the profitable investment, new jobs, new business opportunities. People need to understand that it will be an advantage, it gives a better quality of life. We really have to present it this way, otherwise we will miss the target. Finally, what’s next for you? I’m launching a new project, which is about flying around the world with a hydrogen-powered airplane. It’s very good to speak about solutions, but to actually make solutions known, we need to attract people’s interest. And in climate action, we also need to restore hope. For that, we have to go beyond the obvious, get out of our comfort zone, and really start to work clearly on new technologies. I believe hydrogen has a future for heavy transport, where batteries would be too heavy. But it’s not enough to say it—we have to demonstrate it. If we manage to fly around the world nonstop with a hydrogen-powered airplane, people will want to do more with hydrogen. It will make hydrogen more popular. And this is what we need, because today, it’s niche. There’s not enough demand because there’s not enough offer, and there’s not enough offer because there’s not enough demand. The plane now is under construction. It’s called Climate Impulse. It should make a test flight in 2026, and then hopefully fly nonstop around the world, with zero emissions, in 2028.

These plans for militia activity in the wake of the US election are not from a private conversation on an encrypted platform. It was unfolding on a public Facebook profile. Anti-government militia movements have been continuing to use Facebook to recruit, coordinate training, promote ballot box stake outs, and prepare for a civil war that many militants believe will break out after election day. And in some cases, the movement is attracting people who don’t appear to have any prior background in a militia. Meta is even doing the work for extremist movements by auto-generating some group pages on their behalf. Data shared exclusively with WIRED by the Tech Transparency Project shows that these groups have only continued to grow on Facebook, despite WIRED previously flagging this lapse in Meta’s moderation. The brazen proliferation of paramilitary activity on the social media platform days before the election highlights Meta’s lackadaisical approach to enforcing its own bans against groups it has labeled dangerous extremists. Militias require platforms like Facebook to grow: It’s a tool for the paramilitary movement to strengthen and radicalize its network. It also helps them facilitate local organizing, state by state and county by county, and boost their membership. The American paramilitary movement is much less visible than it was in 2020. Militias largely retreated from the streets after the January 6 Capitol riot exposed them to intense public and legal scrutiny, which was intensified by the prosecution of dozens of Oath Keepers. Some groups tried to distance themselves from the movement altogether by dropping any language about a “militia” from their websites, opting instead for more euphemistic names like “civilian guard” and “patriot group.” But after the dust settled following the Capitol riot, the movement began quietly rebuilding on Facebook. And they ramped up training and began coordinating, across counties and states. The Tech Transparency Project has compiled a list of 262 Facebook public and private groups and 193 Facebook pages for militia and anti-government activists that were created since January 6, 2021. Nearly two dozen of those groups and pages have been created since May, according to the TTP. Some make minimal effort to conceal their affiliations to extremist networks: One new public group created in May is called The Michigan III%. Increasingly, the movement is also relying on individual profiles associated with leaders of local militia, the TTP says. Moderation has put a dent in the presence of American Patriots Three Percent (AP3), one of the largest active militias that Facebook explicitly banned in 2020 as a “militarized social movement” and “armed militia group.” Meta, Facebook's parent company, says it carried out a “strategic network disruption” of AP3 in 2020 and again earlier this year in June, removing from Facebook and Instagram a total of 900 groups, pages, and accounts associated with members. \"Adversaries are constantly trying to find new ways around our policies, which is why we continually enforce against violating groups and accounts by investing heavily in people, technology, research, and partnerships,” a Meta spokesperson told WIRED in an email. “We will continue to remove any groups and accounts that violate our policies.” Meta says the company is investigating some of the screenshots of groups that WIRED shared and will remove any content that violates its policies. But WIRED reviewed posts from AP3 groups and profiles that are still on the platform, including examples where members and leaders brandish AP3 insignia and share photos from their in-person training sessions. There have also been some recent instances where Facebook has even auto-generated pages for militias. In May, Facebook auto-generated a page for AP3’s Arizona chapter. In June, Facebook auto-generated a page for “AP3 NM [New Mexico] Training Range.” If you hover over the information widget on the page, Facebook’s explainer reads: “This unofficial page was created because people on Facebook have shown interest in this place or business. It’s not affiliated with or endorsed by anyone associated with AP3 Training Range.” WIRED sent Meta two examples of auto-generated pages. In a statement, the company said: \"One of the two auto-generated Pages had one follower and has been removed, and we couldn’t even verify that the second example of an auto-generated Page exists on the platform.\" Meta has repeatedly come under fire in the past for auto-generating pages for extremist, white supremacist, and terrorist organizations; a whistleblower first flagged the issue in 2020 in a supplement to an earlier petition filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Nearly four years after the January 6 attack on the capitol, Facebook remains a significant recruiting and organizing tool for militias like the AP3, despite creating policies that ban them,” said Katie Paul, director of the Tech Transparency Project. “How can Meta be trusted to effectively thwart extremists that have a record of engaging in and stoking political violence when its own systems create business pages for them?” In a video from 2022 that was recently published as part of a leak to Distributed Denial of Secrets, AP3 leader Scot Seddon stressed the importance of Facebook to his group’s operational success. “We’ve always used Facebook, Facebook has been our greatest weapon. It has gotten us where we are today,” Seddon told the camera. “We need to use the tools that are in front of us to achieve the goals of where we want to be. Our goal is to network, be as big as possible, have as many like-minded patriots in our states that we can rely upon should shit hit the fan.” Extremist groups need access to mainstream platforms like Facebook to reach and radicalize people. When those groups are banned from larger platforms and relegated to fringe sites, their reach and recruitment opportunities are limited and their numbers can become stagnant or start dropping. “We know the power of Facebook as an organizing platform, to pull in people who have fallen down rabbit holes and radicalize them further,” says Jon Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. “We should be concerned that actual organized domestic extremist groups have free rein on platforms that millions of Americans use.” Now, as the election fast approaches, the paramilitary network on Facebook has been a hive of people looking to link up, train, and prepare. A review by WIRED of recent Facebook posts in a number of these militia groups also suggests that the paramilitary movement has lately been attracting individuals who don’t have previous experience of being part of a militia. “I’m looking for a group of people that see and understand the dire situation our country is in,” wrote one poster in the Facebook group U.S.A. Militia We The People last month. “A group of people that understand that civil war is at our doorstep if Kamala makes it into office. Am I in the right place?” In another post earlier this month in a group for a county-level militia in Virginia, a member shared that he and his wife were interested in joining up, before asking for more information about how to do so. Also earlier this month, a new member of a militia group in Oklahoma introduced himself as a military veteran and said he was a member of a militia from 2015 to 2017 but wants to get involved again. “My battle rattle is ready to go any time,” he added. Two county-level militias in Virginia have created Facebook pages in the past month, which they’ve used to coordinate their inaugural “musters” (militia speak for a meetup) in recent weeks. Another local Virginia militia has organized a meeting for two days after the election. The “commander” of a Three Percenter group in Kentucky—who posed for a photograph viewed by WIRED with Representative Thomas Massie last summer while wearing full gear and insignia—has used his profile to share images from training sessions and regularly makes inflammatory statements. In a recent post, he suggested that state militias ought to rally at their chosen state parks: “Three national base camps could be state or national parks … (for example) west in NV or CO, central Missouri and east WV or VA. Then get comms established.” In a “Patriot Group” in Barron County, Wisconsin, a recent lively discussion led by a “top contributor” urged members to “organize and monitor” ballot drop boxes. Several members of the group proposed planting small cameras in the vicinity of the boxes. Ballot drop surveillance has continued to be a hot topic of discussion among election deniers and paramilitary groups. Militias also teamed up with election deniers to conduct covert surveillance of ballot drop boxes during the midterm elections, recent leaks published by Distributed Denial of Secrets and reported by WIRED show. A recent DHS intelligence memo warned law enforcement agencies that domestic extremists could try to sabotage or attack ballot boxes. The administrator of a New Hampshire–based group called the MAGA Continental Army claims that he recently met with the local police chief to discuss preparations in the event that a civil war breaks out. “He told me if it came to civil war that he will be directing his officers to defend the people—they will not be coming after your guns,” he wrote. He added that the chief said all members should come to the police department if conflict broke out. In one public group called The Party of Trump, with 171,000 members, a discussion about ballot drop box monitoring prompted someone to suggest that Trump supporters come armed with their AR-15s to stand guard. In another public group called We Fight for Our Lives, someone urged others to get organized ahead of the election and suggested enlisting bikers and militia. “I’m ready to fight,” one person responded. “I’ll pull the fuckin trigger fo sho” the original poster added. In another public group called SAVE THE FLAG AMERICA, someone put the stakes of the election in bleak terms: “In a matter of days, we will ascertain our financial capacity to procure essential commodities such as groceries and fuel, or, alternatively face the prospect of engaging in armed conflict.” “Trump 2024,” someone responded. “God is always in control.” This story has been updated with additional comment from Meta.

They’d gathered after a website called MySpiritHalloween.com published an AI-generated article promoting the festivities. The post promised “spectacular floats to thrilling street performances” and described the route in detail. The parade never came—but the spectacle of throngs of people milling around for nothing became an event unto itself. Afterward, the incident went viral as an example of AI slop seeping into the real world. Since the generative AI boom began, a class of SEO entrepreneurs has started pumping out AI-generated content on websites and across social platforms, in efforts to make money off online advertising and affiliate marketing. MySpiritHalloween.com owner Nazir Ali is one of them. WIRED spoke with Ali via Google Meet to get his side of the story. He insists it’s all just a big misunderstanding. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Nazir Ali: Ask anything. Kate Knibbs: Well, how are you doing? I am actually good, but we are highly embarrassed. We are highly depressed that everyone is reporting against us. They're calling us scammers, saying that we scammed. This was not on purpose! Can you explain what happened? The thing is, we are the content creators. I am the owner of a SEO agency. We make websites and we rank them on Google. We hired some content writers online, and they helped us out on all the Halloween events throughout the world: in the USA, in UK, and most importantly, Ireland. If there are any mistakes, for example you see an event and it was moved—there were some events in Dubai, but hotel management texted us and said that the event was not listed, so we removed it immediately. But no one reported that this one wasn’t going to happen. As soon as we knew, we changed it. We even wrote this has been canceled, but it was too late. I want to ask about the AI of it all— I’ll explain it to you. You can easily write a whole website with AI. But it is not easy to rank on Google’s first page, and our site was ranked on the first page. It was even on the first position of the first page. Okay, AI was involved. We asked ChatGPT to write the article for us, but it wasn’t ChatGPT by itself. So we took help from AI, we took help from ChatGPT, but we optimized that ourselves. So there was a human editor? Exactly, yes, we humanized it. Definitely. You cannot rank through AI content alone. AI was involved 10 percent or 20 percent. We were 80 percent involved. And we apologize to our Irish brothers. We are highly disappointed, highly embarrassed, and honestly, we are feeling bad. Dubliners awaiting a Halloween parade that never showed up. How many other websites do you have? I own five websites. And actually, I want to tell you one more thing. Are you familiar with St. Patrick’s Day? Yes. We wrote a lot of events this year, on the 17th of March, St. Patrick’s Day—and they were ranked. People even congratulated us. They thanked us for listing events about St Patrick's Day. No event was reported as bogus, or AI-generated, or anything like that. We try our best to give people authentic content. We don't actually want to mislead any of our Irish brothers. This was just a mistake. And you guys should not say that we are the scammers, unless you actually know it, unless you ask us. This is why I am here to clarify things. I appreciate that. We own this mistake. So your name is Nazir Ali, but when you say “we”— We are not going to give you any personal information that might be harmful for us. Everyone is writing about us, and they are telling us that we are scammers. Would you be comfortable telling me about the reports that you’re based in Pakistan? Is that true? We hire some of the content creators, and one is from Pakistan, and others are from some other countries. But I don't want to actually reveal their nationalities. People will blame the country if I say I'm from Dubai, then whenever you write an article, if you say that a guy from Pakistan, a guy from India, guy from Ireland, a guy from the UAE, it actually hurts some of the citizens of that country. Would you be comfortable telling me how long you’ve had this Halloween website? You will be shocked to know that we ranked our site in three months on the Google first page. So you've only been in operation for three months? Yes. Why holiday events? It’s a huge topic, but only for one day. So it is easy for us to generate revenue for that one day—then we don't have to put in effort throughout the year. We just do work for three or four months, and then we'll get the revenue. Could you explain more about your business model. How do you make money? Our business model is Google Ads. Google Ads and affiliate marketing. Has this made you reconsider the ways that you operate? Will you change how you use AI going forward? It is our mistake. We should double check it. Not only double, but triple check it. One more thing I want to add is that people should not consider Google as the standard. Google is just a search engine, and any person can post anything on it. Don't just believe it. Just cross check! Are you concerned that Google will downrank you now? Definitely. We are expecting Google will derank. Is there anything you could try to do to prevent that? No, there is nothing. And this is because of all the misinformation provided by the journalists. They don't actually know what our intentions are, but they are showing that our intentions are wrong. But right now the guys are very depressed. Listen to me. If we wanted to scam people, we can easily do so by selling fake tickets. But we never mentioned any tickets on the website. That would be very simple, but we didn't even mention the ticket thing. Well, I’m glad you didn’t do that. Then we would be scammers, but we don’t do it, because it is illegal and prohibited. How much money do you make off SEO? It is very personal, and it depends on the traffic. Ballpark? One more thing is that we posted around 1,400 articles. It is not easy to post 1,400 articles in three months and to make them rank in Google. This shows that this is a mistake. This is not a scam. We have other articles, we have other websites. We never had this type of issue before. In addition to the St. Patrick's Day websites, what are some of the other websites you’re running? Actually, there are few others about animals. Another niche is about SEO, and how you can be an SEO expert, but I’m not going to reveal those. OK. Is there anything else you think people have gotten wrong about you? I just want to say that people should not judge so soon. They should go through some of the processes—they can contact me, contact our team. They should ask us questions. They can be harsh, they can be rude. But we are not wrong, and we are not scammers. That’s it.

Late in his team’s game against the Green Bay Packers on September 15, Indianapolis Colts tight end Kylen Granson caught a short pass over the middle of the field, charged forward, and lowered his body to brace for contact. The side of his helmet smacked the face mask of linebacker Quay Walker, and the back of it whacked the ground as Walker wrestled him down. Rising to his feet after the 9-yard gain, Granson tossed the football to an official and returned to the line of scrimmage for the next snap. Aside from it being his first reception of the 2024 National Football League season, this otherwise ordinary play was only noteworthy because of what Granson was wearing at the time of the hit: a 12-ounce, foam-padded, protective helmet covering called a Guardian Cap. Already mandatory for most positions at all NFL preseason practices, as well as regular-season and postseason practices with contact, these soft shells received another vote of confidence this year when the league greenlit them for optional game use, citing a roughly 50 percent drop in training camp concussions since their official 2022 debut. Through six weeks of action this fall, only 10 NFL players had actually taken the field with one on, according to a league spokesperson. But the decision was easy for Granson, who tried out his gameday Guardian Cap—itself covered by a 1-ounce pinnie with the Colts logo to simulate the design of the helmet underneath—in preseason games before committing to wear it for real. “I was pleasantly surprised that it didn’t affect anything for me,” the 26-year-old told WIRED a few days before facing the Packers in week two. “I thought, even if it looks kind of silly, it’s worth it.” There is no ignoring the goofy aesthetics of the puffy, blobby Guardian Caps. The product’s parent company, Guardian Sports, even has staff T-shirts that declare, LOOK GOOD, FEEL GOOD, PLAY GOOD—with LOOK GOOD crossed out. “Condom caps, mushroom heads—we’ve heard them all,” says Erin Hanson, cofounder of Guardian Sports alongside her husband, Lee Hanson. “We just laugh, because we agree.” It can be tough to square the reality that the apparent future of football headgear resembles something out of a ’60s-era sci-fi movie. But the fact that Guardian Caps are now allowed at all in games in the NFL—a league known for policing every inch of player equipment to protect its image—doesn’t just speak to their lab-tested utility (even if published, peer-reviewed on-field data remains lacking). It also reflects the urgency of the moment for football at large. The dangers of strapping on a helmet have never been clearer, given the link between repeated blows to the head—whether concussion-causing or not—and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (otherwise known as CTE, a brain disorder associated with cognitive issues like depression and progressive dementia that can only be diagnosed posthumously). Not coincidentally, the race to find answers has become faster and more lucrative than ever, between the NFL’s funding of private research efforts and a rapidly innovating football headgear industry. And at the center of it all, on the sport’s biggest stage, is a literal mom-and-pop shop that, less than a decade and a half ago, was struggling to find a foothold in football as anything but a joke. The story of the Guardian Cap starts in 1996, some 15 years before its invention. Settled in the Atlanta area with their then-four children, Erin, a former middle-school math teacher, and Lee, a chemical engineer, teamed up to found The Hanson Group, a business-to-business provider of chemical materials. Specializing in polyurethanes and epoxies, the company has since built, among other things, transparent body shields for the US Army, coatings of fuel tank plates for Boeing airplanes, and the outer layers of multiple brands of golf balls. Then, in 2010, the Hansons were contacted out of the blue by an industrial designer named Bert Straus, who decades earlier had created a padded helmet attachment, the ProCap, that was worn in games by a handful of NFL players. Explaining that he was working on a new type of headgear, a hard-shell helmet with interior padding as well as a ProCap-esque soft shell mounted on top, Straus enlisted The Hanson Group to make the integral skin foam for this cushioned outer layer. That winter, the trio traveled to a hotel ballroom in Manhattan and presented their product to NFL officials as part of a special league committee meeting on helmet safety. Even with live testimony provided by former Buffalo Bills safety Mark Kelso, who wore a ProCap for four-plus seasons in the early ’90s, the attempt to convince the NFL of the potential of soft-shell technology was not well-received, the Hansons recall. “That lit a fire under us,” Erin says. Convinced that the best market opportunity lay with a one-size-fits-all option that could retrofit existing helmets at every level of football, as opposed to the brand- and model-specific ProCap, Erin and Lee struck out on their own. But the biggest difference in their eventual prototype had to do with how it was attached to the helmet in the first place: Its straps looped around the facemask and fastened to themselves, thereby loosely “floating” on top of the helmet rather than affixing directly via sticky-backed tabs. The result was what the Hansons would later summarize in their United States patent request as a “protective helmet cap” with “a durable energy absorbing outer shell, which lessens the initial impact to the helmet … [and] an inner surface that allows the outer shell to slide over the surface of a helmet thereby reducing forces applied to a wearer.” As development continued throughout 2011, Erin and Lee used money from The Hanson Group to send the caps away for independent drop testing—a longtime headgear industry standard in which a helmet-wearing dummy head is dropped onto a modular elastomer pad for measuring impact and shock absorption—at accredited sites like Oregon Ballistic Laboratories, ICS Laboratories, and the Southern Impact Research Center. They also shelled out for additional outside testing to ensure that the caps wouldn’t affect neck torque and that they maintained a lower coefficient of friction relative to the usual football helmet’s polycarbonate shell, to ensure that crucial “sliding” effect. “Over the years, we’ve spent a couple hundred grand on testing, because we did so much before we put them on the field,” Erin says. “The whole goal was to help, and it was certainly to not hurt, so we had to vet the product.” Initially branding themselves as POC Ventures—the acronym stood for “protecting our children”—the Hansons launched publicly at the January 2012 convention of the American Football Coaches Association in San Antonio. The goal was to sell caps and eventually attract an established sports equipment company to buy them out. Instead, Erin says, what few attendees dared approach their booth weren’t exactly warm. “You’re sissifying football,” Erin says, recounting one reaction. “That’s the stupidest thing in the world,” Lee says of another. But they soon found their first big believer. That year, at a medical conference in Destin, Florida, the Hansons met Jeffrey Guy, a physician for the University of South Carolina athletic department, who later looked at the caps’ testing data and came away impressed enough for the Gamecocks football team—including future first-overall NFL pick Jadeveon Clowney—to start using them in their 2013 summer practices. Naturally it wasn’t long before one of South Carolina’s biggest rivals, Clemson, had placed orders too. “It really was one team giving it a shot, and it just kept spreading,” Erin says. Along the way, the Hansons abandoned the POC Ventures name after receiving a strongly worded letter from the Swedish cycling and snow sport helmet manufacturer POC, settling on Guardian and a halo logo as reflections of their religious faith. (They later switched the latter, too, to an angel’s wing.) Their belief in their business mission was soon rewarded in April 2017, when the rechristened company was anointed as a winner of an NFL-sponsored research competition for protective football equipment, the HeadHealthTECH challenge, receiving $20,000 to fund future biomechanical testing for their Guardian Caps. The Hansons were back in the door. Technically speaking, Erin and Lee never saw their grand prize. Rather, the money ended up being routed directly to Biokinetics, an Ottawa-based laboratory that partners with the NFL for helmet testing. The results were then analyzed by Biocore, a biomechanical engineering firm out of Charlottesville, Virginia, that also acts as a league consultant for player equipment, including helmets. At the time, the lone model of the Guardian Cap was the Guardian XT, a 7-ounce soft shell then already popular with a growing handful of elite college programs and hundreds of high school teams nationwide. But the results didn’t measure up under lab conditions simulating the higher speeds and masses of professional football hits. “We didn’t really find that it had much of an effect on the NFL impact environment,” says Ann Bailey Good, a senior engineer at Biocore. So the Hansons added an extra layer of padding to the XTs to create a beefier version, the 12-ounce Guardian NXT (with the N standing for NFL). It fared much better. For a 2021 article published in Annals of Biomedical Engineering, five authors—Bailey Good, two Biocore colleagues, and two other engineers who regularly consult for the NFL Players’ Association—subjected their crash dummy helmets to two main tests. The first involved hitting them with a pneumatic ram at speeds and points of impact that were determined in part through video review of concussion-causing plays among linemen during past NFL games. The second, for which the collision sites were picked to minimize face mask interaction and thus maximize helmet-on-helmet exposure, saw dummies with NXTs crash into each other with the aid of an electric belt-driven sled. The results were assembled using the Head Acceleration Response Metric (HARM), a formula that Biocore, the NFLPA's engineering consultants, and several other researchers helped develop. for measuring the severity of an impact and how that correlates to helmet safety and performance. On average, as the study found, the addition of a Guardian NXT was reduced HARM by 9 percent over control helmets with no caps; by comparison, its competition in the study, the ProTech—a modernized version of the ProCap—only reduced HARM by an average of 5 percent. Two aggregate scores were also calculated, by weighing test conditions based on how often those types of impacts occurred to actual NFL linemen and how many reported concussions were sustained due to those impacts. The NXT performed similarly well here, leading the study to conclude that the “Results … suggest that using the GC NXT may reduce the head impact severity exposure for linemen.” “That’s really when it started to become a thing in the league,” Bailey Good says now. The NFL soon brought the Guardian Cap to its Health and Safety Committee, a group of mostly team-, league-, and union-affiliated doctors, and to its Competition Committee, a rules-making body of coaches and team executives appointed by commissioner Roger Goodell. “We talked about the benefits we saw,” says Jeff Miller, an NFL executive vice president overseeing health and player safety. The next year, in 2022, the caps were rolled out for something of a trial period as the Competition Committee recommended that club owners vote to mandate them at preseason practices for select positions that according to league data had sustained the “most frequent head impacts” (offensive and defensive linemen, tight ends, and linebackers) during practice, Miller says. The mandate also only lasted for a four-week stretch when the “greatest density of concussions” had historically occurred—from the start of training camp to the second preseason game. As the Guardian Caps gained more exposure thanks to the NFL’s endorsement, increasing outside research helped shed more light on how they function. “I think it seems logical to most folks: If you cover your whole head in a massive pillow, maybe that’d help you more,” says Nicholas Cecchi, a colead author on a 2023 study at Stanford University that in part performed similar lab impact tests on a version of the Guardian XT as Biocore did with the NXT several years prior. “But there’s more to how it works that didn’t seem intuitive.” In particular, Cecchi, who was a PhD student in bioengineering at the time of the study, cites the “sliding” effect produced by the Guardian Caps’ design. “It really did seem like their main effectiveness was coming from the reduced surface friction on the exterior, and then also the decoupling of different layers,” he says. In other words, the Guardian Cap isn’t just a hat on a hat; the two-part, add-on system has its benefits. When a helmet hit happens, says Cecchi, “you’ve got linear forces and rotational forces. Linear are going to be reduced by compression of the materials. Rotational forces will be reduced by the shearing and sliding of the different materials. The more that happens, the more it’ll absorb the rotation, so less rotation will be experienced by your head. “From the lab tests, it seemed very clear, in almost all scenarios, the Guardian Cap reduced the magnitude of those rotational accelerations, and other metrics linked to football-related injury risks, by a good amount.” Less conclusive is the data regarding how the Guardian Caps perform on the actual field. In addition to their lab component, Cecchi and his colleagues used instrumented mouth guards to look at helmet-to-helmet impacts sustained by a handful of linebackers on Stanford’s football team in practices over two seasons: in 2019, when players wore bare helmets, and in 2021, when Guardian Caps were mandatory. “We did not observe any significant reductions in any measure of impact severity after implementation of the padded helmet shell cover,” the study concluded. Similarly, in 2022, at the University of North Carolina, sensor-equipped helmets logged 14 full-contact practices among 10 players: five with Guardian Caps and five who opted to not wear them. As researchers later wrote in a late-2023 report for the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, the coverings “did not affect head impact kinematic outcomes.” But these studies also categorized their on-field findings as “preliminary” and “pilot,” respectively, in part due to the obvious small sample sizes. Here again, Biocore, backed by the NFL, is leading the way: According to Bailey Good, a paper unpacking the Guardian Caps’ effect in their first two years of preseason practice use—in particular the league’s touted 50 percent drop in concussions among linemen, tight ends, and linebackers, from an average of 35 in 2018, 2019, and 2021 to 18 during this last postseason—was submitted “a few months ago” and is currently being peer reviewed. “We certainly considered other things like number of practices, practice intensity, et cetera,” Bailey Good says. “But looking at the results that we saw in the preseason related to concussions, it was very promising.” Meaningful game data will take even longer to surface; the NCAA has yet to formally approve Guardian Caps for games at the college level, and while the National Federation of State High School Associations has allowed them in both practices and games since 2013, few examples of the latter exist. But the Hansons reject the idea that further testing is required to judge the credentials of their creation. “We didn't just develop this three months ago—it’s been out on the field for 12 years,” Lee says. “I know it's anecdotal data, but what everyone tells us is that they feel better, they play better, and they have reductions in the numbers of injuries.” At the same time, the Hansons are sensitive to what they see as a common overstatement of the caps’ capabilities. “We do not talk about reducing concussions,” Erin says. “Science can only measure reduction of impact, reduction of forces. How that relates to brain injuries—there's a lot of unknowns that are still out there. Is it responsible to say this is the panacea for all? No, it's not going to fix everything. “But do we know they’re making a difference? Hell yeah.” More and more appear to be agreeing every day. Sitting in a conference room at the Guardian Sports offices in late August, Erin hits Play on a voice memo that a new client from Denver recently sent to Guardian’s national sales manager. “This is a good one,” she says, as a familiar southern twang comes through the speaker: “Hey … this is Peyton Manning calling … I coach an eighth-grade youth football team … and I was thinking I wanted to maybe ask about ordering some Guardian Caps … I feel like it’s the right thing to do.” Two football helmets bake in the afternoon sun atop a picnic table, one wearing a Guardian Cap and the other bare. The Hansons put them here, outside the entrance to their company’s headquarters in a suburban business park northeast of Atlanta, as a practical demonstration of how the coverings, at 90-plus degree temperatures, can help insulate the helmet from outside heat. (Miller says that NFL testing has backed this up.) Bearing an angel’s wing logo on the front, the black-walled building is a 90,000-square-foot facility that Guardian Sports splits with The Hanson Group. Together it is a family operation in the most literal sense: Out of close to 50 employees between the two sides, 10 are members of the Hanson clan, including three of Erin and Lee’s now-five children and two sons-in-law. It took almost a full decade for Guardian Sports to become financially self-sustaining, and even longer to finish paying back The Hanson Group for the seven-figure costs of external lab testing and an early bulk purchase of more than 100,000 caps—that happened just last year. But the bustling scene suggests that business is good today. In the warehouse, towering stacks of Guardian Caps inventory have overtaken what was once an employee exercise area, like cubed cardboard weeds. In the loading dock, a truck drops off a fresh supply of green and maroon caps air-shipped from the company’s factory in Dongguan, China after their stockpile of those colors ran out. When it comes to the Guardian Cap, the XTs sell for about $70 at retail stores and online but less than $55 in group orders for teams, while the NXTs are only sold direct to teams at an average of $100 apiece. According to the company, some 77 percent of its overall sales happens in bulk. But only a small portion of that total—about 200,000 caps sold this year, the company projects—comes from the NFL’s 32 teams, each of which typically stocks about 100 per season, replacing them every one to two years depending on the position and wear. Not counting the cost of NFL testing through Biocore, though, Erin says Guardian has “never received a dime” directly from the league. Adds Lee, “They own the data too—only when they publish it, we get to see it.” But the benefit of having a public stamp of approval in the shape of the NFL shield is obvious. “We had to have outside validation, and that’s what the NFL has done for us,” Erin says. “You can’t put a value on the marketing that you get from your product. But they’re not writing us checks, that’s for sure.” On the flip side, the company has already done more for the NFL than its owners ever imagined. “The last thing we ever wanted to be in was the customization business,” Erin says, referring to the nine months it took to create the Guardian Cap pinnies that matched the helmets of every team so they could be worn in games this season. Between designing the concepts, conducting testing through Biocore, enlisting two college teams (Colorado and Georgia) to pilot them at spring practice, and ensuring the proper pantones and logos—all but four sent the initial batch back, including the Carolina Panthers, who requested that the silver pinnie “sparkle more,” Erin says—every step was geared toward aesthetic goals. Asked if it was a necessary headache to collaborate with the league, Lee replies immediately: “Yes.” Adds Erin, “If it allows a player who feels like he's getting the same benefit in a game as in practice, then it's worth it.” To this end, Guardian recently completed production on versions 2.0 of both the XT and NXT caps, featuring flatter, more helmetlike exteriors onto which teams can iron on logo decals. “The barriers to gameplay, I think, are the lack of gameplay testing data and the aesthetics,” says chief operating officer Jake Hanson, Erin and Lee’s son. “The more we can get at those with the 2.0s, the better.” Given the relative lack of caps in NFL stadiums so far this season, it seems unlikely that they can catch on as a widespread gameday add-on. But even their future in practice remains uncertain. “The Guardian Cap could be a transition as we move from good helmets to better helmets, as that technology continues to improve,” Miller says. That time might already be here: Entering this season, Biocore approved six new helmet models that would allow any player who wore one to be exempt from the Guardian Cap practice mandate. And more than 200 players have already taken advantage of the carve-out, “an unprecedented rate of adoption for a new piece of equipment,” NFL chief medical officer Allen Sills said on a media call in early October. To both the lab and the league, the decision here boiled down to incentivizing players to use better-performing helmets. “Decreasing benefit to wearing it, to the point where some of the technology that the helmets have now made the addition of a Guardian Cap on top of it of less utility than it would’ve been with one of the other helmets,” Miller says, when asked why the coverings were made optional at all. “And eventually you get to the plus-minus of, well, you’re adding a bunch of ounces to your head.” Should the Hansons buck the odds once more and become a bigger NFL game-day presence down the line, it might be former players turned coaches leading the way. Like Manning. Or former running back and fellow Hall of Famer Jerome Bettis, an early proponent who bought Guardian Caps for an Atlanta-area youth football league that he and ex-Pittsburgh Steelers teammate Tim Lester started for their sons in the mid-2010s. “You'll get these comments about, how can you put these things in the game?” Erin says. “Then you have interactions with people who are actually living the repercussions, it's a whole different thing.” As for one of the few current players to have embraced the Guardian Caps in games, the Colts’ Granson doesn’t see himself stopping anytime soon. “A big hit’s gonna happen—that’s the inevitability of the game,” he says. “But if I can reduce the contact of the little hits, then that’ll spare me down the road.” In your inbox: A new series of tips for how to use AI every day Meet the masked vigilante tracking down billions in crypto scams Deep dive: This app set out to fight pesticides.

For months, billionaire and X owner Elon Musk has used his platform to share election conspiracy theories that could undermine faith in the outcome of the 2024 election. Last week, the political action committee (PAC) Musk backs took it a step further, launching a group on X called the Election Integrity Community. The group has nearly 50,000 members and says that it is meant to be a place where users can “share potential incidents of voter fraud or irregularities you see while voting in the 2024 election.” In practice, it is a cesspool of election conspiracy theories, alleging everything from unauthorized immigrants voting to misspelled candidate names on ballots. “It's just an election denier jamboree,” says Paul Barrett, deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University, who authored a recent report on how social media facilitates political violence. Since endorsing former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump following the first assassination attempt against him in July, Musk has become one of Trump’s most important financial backers, pouring more than $100 million into the America PAC since July. The PAC has also been a pillar of the Trump campaign’s ground game in swing states. WIRED reporting found that Blitz Canvassing, a contractor for the PAC, was threatening canvassers in Michigan, and transporting them in U-Hauls. Earlier in October, Musk appeared at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he repeated false claims that Democrats would allow undocumented immigrants to vote illegally, and encouraged Trump’s supporters to vote. In January 2021, the company then known as Twitter banned Trump’s account for incitement to violence during the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. But since taking over and rebranding it as X, Musk has fired many of the people on the teams that worked to keep mis- and disinformation off the platform. Last year, X fired much of what remained of its elections integrity team. After the news broke, Musk posted on X, saying, “Oh you mean the ‘Election Integrity’ Team that was undermining election integrity? Yeah, they’re gone.” Barrett says that the America PAC’s Election Integrity Community group augments the work of other election-denying groups, like former Trump adviser Cleta Mitchell’s Election Integrity Network. “This is a parallel anti-election, anti-democracy campaign designed to sow confusion and lay the groundwork for baseless objections to elections after Election Day. This is going on all across the country, and it's extremely dangerous,” says Barrett. “And we're going to see the results of it almost immediately when the polls close on November 5th.”  Inside the group, multiple accounts shared a viral video of a person ripping up ballots, allegedly from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, which US intelligence agencies have said is fake. Another account shared a video from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones alleging that unauthorized immigrants were being bussed to polling locations to vote. One video shared multiple times, and also purportedly from Buck County, shows a voter confronting a woman with a “voter protection” tag on a lanyard who tells the woman filming that she is there for “early vote monitoring” and asks not to be recorded. Text in the accompanying post says that there were “long lines and early cut offs” and alleges election interference. That post has been viewed more than 1 million times. Some accounts merely retweet local news stories, or right-wing influencers like Lara Loomer and Jack Posobiec, rather than sharing their own personal experiences. One account merely reshared a post from Sidney Powell, the disgraced lawyer who attempted to help Trump overturn the 2020 election, in which she says that voting machines in Wisconsin connect to the internet, and therefore could be tampered with. In actuality, voting machines are difficult to hack. Many of the accounts reference issues in swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. But Barrett says that the real value of this group, and others like it, is not necessarily to collect or verify actual issues at polling places or with voting machines—things that can, and do, happen in a normal election. Instead, it is a way to bolster claims that the election is being stolen, amassing thousands of “examples” that will serve to support an argument that Trump lost by fraud if he is defeated at that ballot box. “This is another cynical and destructive step that Musk and many, many others on the political right are taking to undermine faith in elections, because of their anxiety that if elections are just held in a conventional, straightforward way, their side loses,” he says.

With only a few days left until the US presidential election, Donald Trump is claiming that some of Silicon Valley’s most powerful billionaires and tech leaders are seeking him out. Many of these leaders, like Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, became figureheads for Trump’s ire over what he believed to be censorship of conservative speech online. Now, as some of the most powerful people in Silicon Valley appear to be quietly sitting out the presidential election cycle, Trump is saying they’ve grown more complimentary of the former president as polls continue to show Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris neck and neck. Influential business leaders are hedging their bets and preparing themselves and their interests just in case Trump wins, according to the Washington Post. Of course, it’s not all just hearsay—Tesla CEO Elon Musk has explicitly thrown his money and support behind the former president in recent weeks. Here’s a running list of the Silicon Valley CEOs Trump says are courting him in the lead-up to the election: On Joe Rogan’s podcast on Friday, Trump claimed that Google CEO Sundar Pichai called to congratulate the former president on his viral McDonald’s stunt. “This McDonald’s thing, I want to tell you, it’s one of the biggest things we’ve seen on Google,” Trump said Pichai told him. Trump repeated the claim again during a Saturday rally in Pennsylvania: “I actually got a call from Sundar, Sundar, who’s great, from Google, he’s a great guy, very smart. The head of Google,” he said. “And he said, ‘Sir, I just want to tell you, what you did with McDonald’s was one of the single biggest events we’ve ever had at Google.’” Trump once again described the alleged call during a Sunday evening rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Pichai has not publicly confirmed if this conversation took place. Google has not responded to requests for comment from WIRED. Earlier this month, Trump said that Cook had called him to complain about a multibillion-dollar fine Apple received from the European Union this year. “[Cook] said something that was interesting,” Trump said. “He said they’re using that to run their enterprise, meaning Europe is their enterprise.” I said, ‘That’s a lot … But Tim, I got to get elected first, but I’m not going to let them take advantage of our companies—that won’t, you know, be happening.’” Trump’s relationship with Apple CEO Tim Cook is one of the most congenial the former president has shared with a Silicon Valley leader. Cook maintained a relationship with Trump during his time in office, often meeting with the president and serving on advisory panels influencing policy decisions that affect Apple’s business, such as tariffs and immigration. Cook has not publicly confirmed that this most recent call took place. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED. Shortly after the assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, this summer, the former president claimed that Zuckerberg called him. In an interview with New York magazine, Trump claimed that Zuckerberg said, “‘I will never vote for people running against you after watching what you did.’” A Meta spokesperson contested what Trump told the magazine, saying, “As Mark has said publicly, he’s not endorsing anybody in this race and has not communicated to anybody how he intends to vote.” (Zuckerberg did not endorse any candidate in the 2016 and 2020 elections and has said that he won’t this cycle either.) While Meta wouldn’t detail the contents of the call, Zuckerberg confirmed he had called Trump after the assassination attempt, calling the former president “bad ass” in July. “Seeing Donald Trump get up after getting shot in the face and pump his fist in the air with the American flag is one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen in my life,” Zuckerberg said. Under Trump, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sustained countless attacks from the Trump administration and conservative lawmakers over censorship allegations. In 2020, Zuckerberg donated $350 million in pandemic support to election departments around the country. Republicans accused these “Zuckerbucks” donations of being unfairly distributed to Democratic districts. In 2021, following the January 6 riot at the Capitol, Trump was banned from Facebook and Instagram. Former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has been under fire in recent days after he decided that the Washington Post would no longer endorse presidential candidates, despite the paper having a Harris endorsement in the works. Trump has long criticized Bezos for his ownership of the Washington Post, but Trump said that Bezos had called him after this summer’s assassination attempt. “It is the most incredible thing I’ve ever watched,” Trump said Bezos told him. “I said, ‘Despite the fact you own the Washington Post, I appreciate it.” Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, reportedly called Trump after the July shooting as well. Much of Bezos’ and Amazon’s business interests rely on government contracts, especially with Amazon Web Services, Amazon’s cloud computing arm, and Blue Origin. Amazon and Blue Origin did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Two years after acquiring Twitter to bring “free speech” back to the platform, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has gone full MAGA. Musk formally endorsed Trump on X after the July assassination attempt, writing, “Last time America had a candidate this tough was Theodore Roosevelt.” Since then, Musk has become one of Trump’s largest donors, spending more than $110 million to bolster the former president’s campaign. The Musk-backed America PAC is aggressively canvassing across battleground states to turn out the vote for Trump. Musk has also joined Trump on the campaign trail, spending the past few weeks stumping for Trump in states like Pennsylvania. Musk has also been using X to support Trump’s campaign, frequently reposting campaign material and links for users to register to vote. X CEO Linda Yaccarino has not endorsed Trump, but has tweeted messages of support after the July shooting and previously served on a Trump administration council promoting public health.

            "content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. As digital scamming explodes in Southeast Asia, including so called “pig butchering” investment scams, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) issued a comprehensive report this week with a dire warning about the rapid growth of this criminal ecosystem. Many digital scams have traditionally relied on social engineering, or tricking victims into giving away their money willingly, rather than leaning on malware or other highly technical methods. But researchers have increasingly sounded the alarm that scammers are incorporating generative AI content and deepfakes to expand the scale and effectiveness of their operations. And the UN report offers the clearest evidence yet that these high tech tools are turning an already urgent situation into a crisis. In addition to buying written scripts to use with potential victims or relying on templates for malicious websites, attackers have increasingly been leaning on generative AI platforms to create communication content in multiple languages and deepfake generators that can create photos or even video of nonexistent people to show victims and enhance verisimilitude. Scammers have also been expanding their use of tools that can drain a victim’s cryptocurrency wallets, have been manipulating transaction records to trick targets into sending cryptocurrency to the wrong places, and are compromising smart contracts to steal cryptocurrency. And in some cases, they’ve been purchasing Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite internet systems to help power their efforts. “Agile criminal networks are integrating these new technologies faster than anticipated, driven by new online marketplaces and service providers which have supercharged the illicit service economy,” John Wojcik, a UNODC regional analyst, tells WIRED. “These developments have not only expanded the scope and efficiency of cyber-enabled fraud and cybercrime, but they have also lowered the barriers to entry for criminal networks that previously lacked the technical skills to exploit more sophisticated and profitable methods.” For years, China-linked criminals have trafficked people into gigantic compounds in Southeast Asia, where they are often forced to run scams, held against their will, and beaten if they refuse instructions. Around 200,000 people, from at least 60 countries, have been trafficked to compounds largely in Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos over the last five years. However, as WIRED reporting has shown, these operations are spreading globally—with scamming infrastructure emerging in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and West Africa. Most prominently, these organized crime operations have run pig butchering scams, where they build intimate relationships with victims before introducing an “investment opportunity” and asking for money. Criminal organizations may have conned people out of around $75 billion through pig butchering scams. Aside from pig butchering, according to the UN report, criminals across Southeast Asia are also running job scams, law enforcement impersonation, asset recovery scams, virtual kidnappings, sextortion, loan scams, business email compromise, and other illicit schemes. Criminal networks in the region earned up to $37 billion last year, UN officials estimate. Perhaps unsurprisingly, all of this revenue is allowing scammers to expand their operations and diversify, incorporating new infrastructure and technology into their systems in the hope of making them more efficient and brutally effective. For example, scammers are often constrained by their language skills and ability to keep up conversations with potentially hundreds of victims at a time in numerous languages and dialects. However, generative AI developments within the last two years—including the launch of writing tools such as ChatGPT—are making it easier for criminals to break down language barriers and create the content needed for scamming. The UN’s report says AI can be used for automating phishing attacks that ensnare victims, the creation of fake identities and online profiles, and the crafting of personalized scripts to trick victims while messaging them in different languages. “These developments have not only expanded the scope and efficiency of cyber-enabled fraud and cybercrime, but they have also lowered the barriers to entry for criminal networks that previously lacked the technical skills to exploit sophisticated and profitable methods,” the report says. Stephanie Baroud, a criminal intelligence analyst in Interpol’s human trafficking unit, says the impact of AI needs to be considered as part of a pig butchering scammer’s tactics going forward. Baroud, who spoke with WIRED in an interview before the publication of the UN report, says the criminal’s recruitment ads that lure people into being trafficked to scamming compounds used to be “very generic” and full of grammatical errors. However, AI is now making them appear more polished and compelling, Baroud says. “It is really making it easier to create a very realistic job offer,” she says. “Unfortunately, this will make it much more difficult to identify which is the real and which is the fake ads.” Perhaps the biggest AI paradigm shift in such digital attacks comes from deepfakes. Scammers are increasingly using machine-learning systems to allow for real-time face-swapping. This technology, which has also been used by romance scammers in West Africa, allows criminals to change their appearance on calls with their victims, making them realistically appear to be a different person. The technology is allowing “one-click” face swaps and high-resolution video feeds, the UN’s report states. Such services are a game changer for scammers, because they allow attackers to “prove” to victims in photos or real-time video calls that they are who they claim to be. Using these setups, however, can require stable internet connections, which can be harder to maintain within some regions where pig butchering compounds and other scamming have flourished. There has been a “notable” increase in cops seizing Starlink satellite dishes in recent months in Southeast Asia, the UN says—80 units were seized between April and June this year. In one such operation carried out in June, Thai police confiscated 58 Starlink devices. In another instance, law enforcement seized 10 Starlink devices and 4,998 preregistered SIM cards while criminals were in the process of moving their operations from Myanmar to Laos. Starlink did not immediately respond to WIRED’s request for comment. “Obviously using real people has been working for them very well, but using the tech could be cheaper after they have the required computers” and connectivity, says Troy Gochenour, a volunteer with the Global Anti-Scam Organization (GASO), a US-based nonprofit that fights human-trafficking and cybercrime operations in Southeast Asia. Gochenour’s research involves tracking trends on Chinese-language Telegram channels related to carrying out pig butchering scams. And he says that it is increasingly common to see people applying to be AI models for scam content. In addition to AI services, attackers have increasingly leaned on other technical solutions as well. One tool that has been increasingly common in digital scamming is so-called “crypto drainers,” a type of malware that has particularly been deployed against victims in Southeast Asia. Drainers can be more or less technically sophisticated, but their common goal is to “drain” funds from a target’s cryptocurrency wallets and redirect the currency to wallets controlled by attackers. Rather than stealing the credentials to access the target wallet directly, drainers are typically designed to look like a legitimate service—either by impersonating an actual platform or creating a plausible brand. Once a victim has been tricked into connecting their wallet to the drainer, they are then manipulated into approving one or a few transactions that grant attackers unintended access to all the funds in the wallet. Drainers can be used in many contexts and with many fronts. They can be a component of pig butchering investment scams, or promoted to potential victims through compromised social media accounts, phishing campaigns, and malvertizing. Researchers from the firm ScamSniffer, for example, published findings in December about sponsored social media and search engine ads linked to malicious websites that contained a cryptocurrency drainer. The campaign, which ran from March to December 2023 reportedly stole about $59 million from more than 63,000 victims around the world. Far from the low-tech days of doing everything through social engineering by building a rapport with potential victims and crafting tricky emails and text messages, today’s scammers are taking a hybrid approach to make their operations as efficient and lucrative as possible, UN researchers say. And even if they aren’t developing sophisticated malware themselves in most cases, scammers are increasingly in the market to use these malicious tools, prompting malware authors to adapt or create hacking tools for scams like pig butchering. Researchers say that scammers have been seen using infostealers and even remote access trojans that essentially create a backdoor in a victim’s system that can be utilized in other types of attacks. And scammers are also expanding their use of malicious smart contracts that appear to programmatically establish a certain agreed-upon transaction or set of transactions, but actually does much more. “Infostealer logs and underground data markets have also been critical to ongoing market expansion, with access to unprecedented amounts of sensitive data serving as a major catalyst,” Wojcik, from the UNODC, says. The changing tactics are significant as global law enforcement scrambles to deter digital scamming. But they are just one piece of the larger picture, which is increasingly urgent and bleak for forced laborers and victims of these crimes. “It is now increasingly clear that a potentially irreversible displacement and spillover has taken place in which organized crime are able to pick, choose, and move value and jurisdictions as needed, with the resulting situation rapidly outpacing the capacity of governments to contain it,” UN officials wrote in the report. “Failure to address this ecosystem will have consequences for Southeast Asia and other regions.” In your inbox: A new series of tips for how to use AI every day Meet the masked vigilante tracking down billions in crypto scams Deep dive: This app set out to fight pesticides.

Learn more. consider many people's idea of the “best” toiletry bag. A rudimentary pouch or cube with a single zippered compartment—or, perhaps more primitively, a Ziploc bag—with just enough space to hold travel shampoo and conditioner, a toothbrush, maybe a razor. But the items probably roll around and spill, or squish out of hastily screwed-on lids. Next thing you know, you’re rummaging through what's basically a junk drawer any time you need to find something. There is a better way. As someone who lives far from family, I have been traveling every few months for the past 18 years and have tried all genres of toiletry bag—from Dopp kits and cosmetic bags to hanging models so big they take up half of a carry-on suitcase. As any longtime traveler knows, toiletry bags are subjective. Some people like to travel as light as possible with just a razor and some shampoo. Others have elaborate skin- and hair-care routines that practically require a tackle box. There are clear bags, bags with many compartments or elastic organizers, and even bags made out of sailcloth. The only firm principle is that a “good” toiletry bag should make your life easier, not more difficult. To help parse the overwhelming array of options on the market, I've included some of our Gear team members' favorite toiletry bags they've been using for years, plus some new selections from brands whose other bags we loved and those whose designs or features provided something unique to the category.

How We Tested For bags our team hadn’t already been using for years, I spent four weeks rotating new toiletry bags during my morning routine. I noted any annoyances or unique details, volume, how easy it was to store and retrieve items, how much space each one took up on the vanity, how they survived being splashed with water and soap, and, if the bag could hang, how easy it was to retrieve items once hanging. During the testing period, my family happened to go on two weekend trips that required stays in hotels. We took different groups of bags and determined how easy it was to use multiple bags at once in a small space, if their hook designs allowed for multiple places to hang, and whether the contents spilled in or otherwise dirtied the bags, and if so, how easy they were to clean. The Gear team will continue to use the bags and update this guide with longevity and other new observations. What Kind of Toiletry Bag Do I Need? Dopp kits, cosmetics cases, hanging bags … the differences between categories isn’t always clear. Here are some of the more common types of toiletry bags you'll come across, and what to consider with each. Dopp kit: Named for leather craftsman Charles Doppelt, who provided “Dopps,” or toiletry kits, for WWII soldiers. “Dopp kit” has evolved over time to indicate any kind of portable toiletry organizer, but commercially, toiletry bags labeled “Dopp kits” tend to be smaller and hold just a handful of necessities for short trips as opposed to larger fold-up hanging bags and cosmetics cases. Cosmetics case: Designed for those who need more than just the necessities, a cosmetics case is usually a much larger boxlike container with specialized compartments for makeup, skin care, hair care, and other necessities. They often come with extras like brush holders and mirrors. Hanging toiletry bag: A bag that, as the name indicates, comes with a hook so that it can be hung on a hook, towel rack, tree, or someplace it won’t take up space on the counter. Often, the user needs to hang them to be able to access all the storage compartments. Something to consider is that hooks can be used up quite quickly if everyone in your hotel room has a hanging bag. All the hooks in our bathroom were taken almost immediately, so my husband ended up having to hang his bag over the toilet, which he wasn’t thrilled about. A good hanging toiletry bag will also have a hook that's thin enough to slip over just about any hook, and be rubber tipped so it won't slide off. The maker of our favorite carry-on suitcase, Away, has done it again with this sleek, well-made, unisex toiletry bag that holds an impressive amount of items—especially for its modest 10.2 x 3.7-inch countertop footprint. I tested the large (3.6 liter) size; it also comes in a small (2.3 liter) size, and I was able to fit three full-size bottles of hair product in addition to a hand mirror, all my makeup, and various travel-size items in its sturdy, pouchlike confines. My items felt both secure and immediately accessible. The bag is also long enough to fit that ubiquitous awkward plastic toothbrush pouch so many of us get from the dentist. There's a central zip compartment, a clear zip pocket lined with PVC, and an easy-access zippered pocket on the back. For those who like to match, many of the available colors mirror Away's hard-sided luggage. (If that's not enough customization, you can also pay an extra $20 to have the exterior of the toiletry bag embroidered with your initials.) The only thing I didn't like is that the matte nylon exterior, while water-resistant, does tend to pick up stains quickly. An impressive value, this no-nonsense bag is packed with enough organizational features to satisfy a wide array of travelers. I tested the medium size, which should be plenty large for most people with its six zippered pouches—two lined with easy-clean PVC and one with mesh—plus a handy detachable shower caddy and mirror. Three mesh non-zippered pouches in the main compartment are large enough to fit smaller full-size tubes of product, and the thin, rubber-tipped hook makes it easy to hang just about anywhere without slipping off. It's also got a fabric handle on the top for carrying. It comes in a slew of colors, fabrics, and prints, although it's on the heavier side at 14 ounces and has a large 11.5 x 9.75-inch footprint if you're unable to hang it. L.L. Bean says its abrasion-resistant nylon packcloth exterior keeps spills contained, and though I found this to be true in the short term after “spilling” half of a travel-size container of liquid inside, the liquid was able to leak out of the zipper and, after half a day, the fabric became damp. L.L. Bean's water-resistance claims aside, my whole family loved the versatility of this bag. I’ve had the Beis Dopp Kit for four years now, and it’s still my go-to for any trip. The poly canvas material is durable and easy to spot-clean. Plus, I opted for the black version to mask the inevitable scuffs and smaller stains. What I love the most, though, are the compartments. The water-resistant section is a total game changer when packing liquids or fragrances. If something leaks, a quick wipe gets the job done. The waterproof bottom is also a huge bonus when I’m getting ready at a bathroom sink. The wire-frame top section stays open while I’m packing or digging around for something. Inside, there’s a zippered pocket where I store my toothbrush and toothpaste, and a separate compartment for smaller essentials like my contact lens case. I’ll admit it’s a little bulky, so if you’re tight on space, it might not be the best fit. I usually check mine in, since it holds my full-size products, but if I’m packing light, it also works for TSA-friendly items in a carry-on. —Boutayna Chokrane Wandrd's Toiletry Bag comes in two sizes: medium and large. Get the large, because it has more storage and organization and doesn't cost much more. The medium, which is also available on Amazon, is a little too simple for the asking price (though if you buy both, you can merge them together). It's made from Robic nylon with a thermoplastic urethane coating, and it's weather-proof (not submersible), thanks to the zippers and coating. That should help keep liquid in if your perfume bottle breaks when baggage handlers are a little too carefree with your luggage. There are webbing loops on the exterior, and this lets you connect it to other bags, like Wandrd's Prvke (my favorite camera bag), or you can buy the carry strap ($24) and wear it as a crossbody. Do you want to carry your toiletry bag as a crossbody? Well, maybe! I've stayed at hostels where I've carried all my stuff to the shared shower area, and a strap would've helped dangle it off a doorknob so I didn't have to plop it on the wet ground. On the back of the large size, there are three little pockets for ChapStick and the like, and the middle one has a built-in carabiner. Open up the main compartment and it's spacious, with a zippered pocket on one side and a little spot to attach your toothbrush. The best feature of this bag is the toothbrush protection sleeve, which keeps it so your toothbrush bristles don't touch anything else in the bag. This main compartment could stand to have a little more organization, but I mostly used it to store my hair brush. Lastly, on the outside is another zippered pocket, and this is where you get two mesh pouches and a final zippered pocket. My main gripe is that everything is a dull black, and I wouldn't have minded some color options or at least a brighter interior for easier visibility when grabbing things out of the bag in the dark. —Julian Chokkattu Does the average traveler need a toiletry bag made partially of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), which is 15 times stronger than steel by weight? Perhaps not, but it definitely makes for an interesting bag. Part of Aer’s newly released 10th Anniversary Ultra Collection, this hardy, chunky little Dopp kit incorporates the collection's Ultra400X fabric (in black only) by Challenge Sailcloth, known for its high-performance sails for yacht racers and kite surfers. It's a visibly durable material, slightly shiny with a crinkly look that is certainly unique, if not evocative of a regular bag that accidentally went through the wash. Despite its strength, the Travel Kit is still pretty lightweight at 8 ounces, and I like that it can either sit on the counter with a 9 x 6.5-inch footprint or hang by a hook that tucks neatly away (though the hook is thick plastic and too small for a towel rack). There are zipped pouches on the front and back, with multiple pouches (one lined with neon-green fabric for high visibility in a dark room or suitcase) and a dual-compartment elastic organizer on the inside. Another downside, though it is admittedly a small one, is that the rubbery “Aer” brand tags on the outside and inside seem to accumulate toothbrush and soap residue, as does the mesh zippered pouch in the top compartment, and both proved somewhat difficult to clean. Reviewers Nena Farrell and Boutayna Chokrane both love Béis for its thoughtful design details (see above and here, and also here), and the company's cosmetics case is no exception. It’s a seemingly simple design: a 10 x 7-inch polyurethane rectangle with a handle that opens from the top like a lunchbox—perfect for events like weddings and other public appearances where you need something of an auxiliary makeup station instead of just storage. However, unique features like an easy-to-clean makeup brush holder that pops in and out via a magnet and a large removable mirror make this the most pleasant-to-use cosmetic case I tested. I also appreciate that it comes in seven neutral colors and is easy to clean, with all interior surfaces featuring what Beis calls a “wipeable top coating.” Downsides include bulkiness, being on the heavier side at just under 1 pound by itself, and the paucity of small compartments to separate breakable items or easily damaged makeup like eyeshadow. Known for its ultralight camping and backpacking gear, Sea to Summit makes some of our favorite sleeping bags and tents, so it’s no wonder we also love its light-as-air hanging toiletry bag, made out of water-resistant 30D Ultra-Sil Cordura nylon (color options include blue, orange, and gray). I tested the large version, which features two zippered mesh pouches and a small shatterproof mirror that slides in and out. Travelers can hang the bag on a tree or towel rack, or lay its 11-by-9.5-inch body on a rock or bathroom vanity, though I admit I found it floppy and cumbersome to use when not hanging. For those not taking it outdoors, its lightweight, unstructured body is easily mashable in a suitcase, which is great for packing but not so great for breakable or fragile items like glass containers. The one main compartment is also extremely roomy, so items have a tendency to roll around. For backpackers and travelers concerned with weight, the large version is impressively light at only 4 ounces, including the mirror—the lightest of any bag we tested. Backpackers and those looking for even less weight might do well with the 2.8-ounce small size. Sea to Summit also offers a lifetime guarantee. The erstwhile must-have accessory of both early-aughts Southern sorority girls and their grandmothers, Vera Bradley bags are back with a new spokesperson (Zooey Deschanel), new designs, and updated fabrics like smooth twill and cotton gabardine. (Die-hard fans can rest assured the staple quilted paisley options are still available.) The new line includes multiple styles of toiletry bags that are lightweight, giftable, and can add a pop of color and personality to your travel setup. I tested several, and my favorite was the Lay-Flat Travel Organizer—its two interior clear zippered compartments and three mesh slip pockets were roomy yet snug enough to keep all contents of my morning routine secure, and a rather large spill of soap in the large pocket cleaned up quickly. However, even though the fabric is padded, which provides some protection for the interior contents, the exterior is somewhat absorbent and not machine washable (though other designs are), so be forewarned that light-colored options could attract stains. Cotopaxi’s trim little bag is meant not just for hygiene items, but any collection of odds and ends. It’s made from light recycled deadstock nylon (so, probably not for you if you are carrying glass bottles or anything that needs padding) and weighs in at a modest 6.5 ounces. Your colorway will probably be unique! I like the surprisingly capacious 4-liter capacity spread over three different compartments, with a big middle compartment for your quart bag of liquids and two other compartments with separate, smaller pockets for travel toiletries like floss, lip balm, or a toothbrush. It also has a loop to hang it in the bathroom, so technically it's a hanging toiletry bag. I do have to admit though, that I like hooks better, and hanging is more convenient with a clamshell toiletry bag design. —Adrienne So There were multiple great bags we tried whose features or designs just didn't add up to a place in the top spots above. However, everyone has something different they're looking for in a toiletry bag, so while not perfect for us, some of these options may still be perfect for you. State Bags Benson Toiletry Kit for $68: This is a solid, simple bag with three mesh pouches and a snap-in/snap-out plastic envelope that could theoretically hold something messy like a toothbrush or bar of soap. The navy version I tested had a coated polyester wipe-clean exterior and interior made from recycled bottles, and I liked that it had the option to hang. However, the organization was more rudimentary than similar-category bags we tested, and it was missing some of the thoughtful details featured on other bags in the same price range, like a quick-access pouch on the back and a larger hook with a rubber tip to prevent slipping. (This bag's thick, small plastic hook wasn't even wide enough to hang on a towel rack.) July Hanging Toiletry Bag for $85: I own and love July's carry-on suitcase, so I was excited to try the brand's popular hanging toiletry bag. It's a great design with a zippered pouch on the back, plus a body that zips flat to reveal PVC and pouch zip compartments and a large, rubber-tipped metal hook that tucks away. It looks well-made and stylish with leather trim and gunmetal hardware, but my husband took it on a business trip and found that its pockets are actually quite small, confirming a worry I had when I tested it in my bathroom at home. It wouldn't be an issue if the bag itself were small, but it took up a full quarter of the carry-on. Fjallraven Kanken Toiletry Bag for $55: I love this thing, which makes me feel like a Red Cross nurse on the battlefields of World War II. It’s made from a proprietary Fjallraven fabric blend that combines organic cotton with recycled polyester, so it feels like fabric but is more waterproof and durable. It has a clamshell design with a sturdy interior plastic hook. My quart bag of bottles goes into the enormous lower zip compartment, my toothbrush and deodorant in the top compartment, and there’s mesh pockets and MOLLE webbing so that your tiny things are easily visible. However, its dimensions are very large, so this might not be for you if you’re a minimalist with just a toothbrush and a comb. —Adrienne So Calpak Clear Cosmetics Case for $85: Constructed largely of water-resistant, wipe-clean PVC, this clear cosmetic case (I tested the medium size) zips all the way around and folds flat to reveal two zippered compartments and one smaller zippered mesh bag. It also looks like a cute little purse with its 16 trendy color options, dual handles, and metal bottom studs. However, contents aren't as easy to access as other cosmetic cases that just open from the top—you have to lay the Calpak flat to open both sides, which requires a 16-by-10-inch footprint, and the all-clear construction isn't very discreet.

            "content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Steve Bannon got out of federal prison at around 3 am Tuesday. Seven hours later, he was live on his War Room podcast to “flood the zone with shit” exactly one week before the presidential election. Flooding the zone with shit is Bannon’s own oft-quoted description of his media strategy: churning so many lies or half-truths into the stratosphere that it becomes impossible to draw a line between fact and fiction. “I am more energized and more focused than I’ve ever been in my entire life,” said Bannon on the War Room stream on Rumble, which garnered nearly 100,000 live viewers at one point. “The four months in federal prison not only didn’t break me, it empowered me.” Bannon, 70, a longtime ally of and former strategist for Donald Trump, spent four months at a low-security federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, for contempt after he defied a subpoena in the congressional probe into the January 6 Capitol riot. Bannon has cast himself as a martyr—someone who, like January 6 rioters and like Trump, is being unfairly persecuted by the same tyrannical forces they’re up against next week in the election. On Tuesday on air, and later at a press conference, Bannon repeatedly suggested that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi banished him to prison because she wanted to contain his influence. “If you’re not prepared to be sent to federal prison as a political prisoner, then you’re not worthy to be in this movement,” he said. “You have to understand, they want to put you in prison, and they will put you in prison. If you can’t accept that, then you don’t know what they represent.” Bannon’s return to the public sphere also means the return of a massive mouthpiece to amplify the election fraud conspiracies that are already raging online. And Bannon got directly to business, spinning a tale to his viewers of Democrats plotting to heist the 2024 election. “Every day after November 5 is going to be Stalingrad,” Bannon said. “If they can’t take it away from Trump, if they can’t nullify it right there, they want to at least delegitimize his victory.” “They will go to any length to stop President Trump,” Bannon continued. “That’s the reality.” A 2023 Brookings study on disinformation in political podcasts identified Bannon’s War Room as the biggest disseminator of falsehoods and unsubstantiated claims; about a fifth of all episodes assessed by researchers were determined to have claims flagged as false by debunkers such as Snopes and Politifact. “If the Pelosi apparatus wins, you better be prepared to go to federal prison,” Bannon said. “Because these people have no qualms about weaponizing the justice system, weaponizing the legal system, against Americans who have different political views.” His fans seem to be happy he’s back. “God Bless You Steve' Get The Bannon Sledge Hammer Out, And Start Smashing The TRAITORS,” one viewer wrote during the Tuesday livestream. “Welcome back Steve, we need our leader,” wrote another. “Give us our marching orders and lets get this done.” In your inbox: Our biggest stories, handpicked for you each day The far-right Sheriffs ready to disrupt the election The Big Interview: Marissa Mayer—I am a software girl Here’s what the regenerative cities of tomorrow could look like Election: Follow WIRED's election coverage at WIRED.com/politics More From WIRED Reviews and Guides © 2024 Condé Nast.

            "content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Elon Musk’s America PAC and several other defendants, including the reelection campaign for Representative Michelle Steel, a Republican from California, are accused of violating California labor law in a class action filed in Orange County on October 30, according to court documents obtained by WIRED. The named plaintiffs, Tamiko Anderson and Patricia Kelly, were canvassers for Steel in October of this year, according to the suit, which alleges that they weren’t paid agreed-upon wages. America PAC is named because it provided campaigning services for Steel. The plaintiffs are also suing over an alleged failure to reimburse business expenses and for allegedly being provided inaccurate wage statements. The suit seeks class certification for “All current and former non-exempt employees of Defendants in the State of California who were employed as canvassers and canvassed for Michelle Steel at any time from October 30, 2023, through the present.” “The Steel campaign has no knowledge of these individuals, they did not and do not work for the Steel campaign, and the campaign will not comment on individuals that involve a Super PAC with which we have no involvement,” a spokesperson for the Steel campaign said in a statement. These allegations are different from those WIRED reported earlier this week, when canvassers in Michigan said they were tricked and threatened as part of Elon Musk and America PAC’s get-out-the-vote effort for Donald Trump. The door knockers, who worked for a subcontractor of America PAC, were flown to Michigan, driven in the back of a U-Haul, and told they would have to pay hotel bills unless they met unrealistic quotas. One was surprised to find, upon arrival in Michigan, that they were working to elect Donald Trump.  The Blair Group, a North Carolina firm that the complaint claims is a political consultancy, and Liberty Staffing Services, a Florida firm specializing in hiring and payroll for canvassers and other W2 employees of political campaigns, are the other named defendants. Neither immediately responded to requests for comment. The suit also lists unknown Johns Doe as defendants. The plaintiffs are owed money, according to the suit. “As with other members of the Class, Plaintiffs were guaranteed an agreed upon wage hourly wage [sic] upon starting their employment. However, Plaintiffs are informed and believe that Defendants failed to pay them at the correct hourly wage, and, instead, paid them based on the number of residences they canvassed. To date, Plaintiffs have yet to receive the underpaid wages owed to them,” the complaint states. The defendants in the lawsuit also were not reimbursed for downloading various apps on their personal devices, according to the complaint. The plaintiffs also allege their cell phones were used to track time worked, but that they still were not compensated for those hours. America PAC, into which Musk has poured more than $100 million, has largely taken up get-out-the-vote operations in key swing states for the Donald Trump campaign. Widespread reports depict its operations as a mess, though—in addition to WIRED’s reporting on its efforts in Michigan, The Guardian has reported that up to 25 percent of its door knocks may be fraudulent, and NBC has reported that campaign operatives have concerns about “suspect data.” In an election all polls show as a toss-up, a shambolic field operation could well mean the difference between victory and defeat. Neither Alex Spiro, Musk’s attorney, nor a spokesperson for X, which Musk owns, immediately replied to requests for comment and requests to be put in touch with a representative of America PAC, which does not list contact information on its website. A representative for The Blair Group also did not return a request for comment. Updated 11/1/2024, 7:50 pm EST to add a statement from the Steel campaign and clarify for whom the suit seeks class certification.

            "content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. This summer, Google conspicuously paused its long-held plans to abolish third-party cookies in its Chrome browser after failing to please a mix of privacy campaigners, regulators, and advertisers. The backlash was immediate, with critics seeing the move as a disaster and admission of failure. Soon after the announcement, an article in Digiday described how Google execs were now “in full-on damage control mode, trying to soothe everyone’s nerves, both publicly and behind the scenes.” Meanwhile, digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) called the move “bad for your privacy and good for Google's business.” “By abandoning this plan, Google leaves billions of Chrome users vulnerable to online surveillance,” the EFF’s Lena Cohen wrote. Other browsers including Apple’s Safari have already eradicated third-party cookies that track people across the web and target them with adverts amid concerns about privacy. But as the world’s biggest browser with more than 65 percent share, Chrome’s decision to phase out cookies was set to be the final nail in the coffin for the intrusive trackers. The news, therefore, came as a shock to all sides. So why has Google undergone such a seemingly large U-turn on third-party cookies, how will Chrome include the online trackers going forward, and how will that impact your privacy? Google first announced it would be phasing out third-party cookies in Chrome in 2020. But the company has postponed the move several times after multiple attempts to find an alternative—including the ill-fated FLoC. While it seems like a backtrack, Google argues its new approach offers control over privacy settings while continuing to support third-party cookies for those who want them. Google said in a blog post that it will allow people to “make an informed choice that applies across their web browsing, with the option to adjust that choice at any time.” As this moves forward, it remains “important for developers to have privacy-enhancing alternatives,” a Google spokesperson told WIRED in an emailed statement. Sources familiar with the matter say Google’s new plan will be similar to Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) feature. Introduced in 2021, ATT stipulates that advertisers must ask explicit permission before accessing a user’s mobile advertising ID, the identifier for advertisers (IDFA), for tracking. This means people must click on a pop-up to say “yes” or “no” to tracking when using Apple’s iOS mobile operating system. Google’s Privacy Sandbox APIs, designed to reduce reliance on third-party cookies, will still be available. The firm also intends to offer additional privacy controls and is planning to introduce IP Protection into Chrome's Incognito mode. In response to criticism, Google tells WIRED that “elevating user choice” for third-party cookies “is good for privacy.” “Today’s Privacy Sandbox reflects years of feedback and engagement from privacy advocates, users, regulators, and others across the industry,” Google spokesperson Scott Westover says. “As this moves forward, we’ll continue to collaborate with the industry to build toward the next era of online privacy together.” Google might say it’s keeping third-party cookies, but experts argue that the tracking technology is dead either way. This means advertisers are already having to find other ways to monetize users. “We should have an expectation that the value and utility of third-party cookies has essentially gone to zero,” says Nick Gernert, CEO of WordPress VIP. “Anyone making plans that leverage data from third-party cookies may have diminishing returns in the long run.” The apparent death of cookies also won’t matter much to Google, which has a ton of data from multiple services in addition to Chrome and can target people without cookies. According to Google's 2023 earnings report, $237.86 billion of the firm’s $307.39 billion in revenue came from ads. Ads on its search engine results page and other products including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play are the highest earner at a collective $175.03 billion, or 56.9 percent of overall revenue. YouTube ads bring in $31.51 billion (10.3 percent of the total), and Google Network ads including ads on Google’s partner sites come in at $31.31 billion, 10.2 percent of revenue. Network ad revenues were down by 4.5 percent last year, showing Google reliance on this area is reducing. Google knows it’s quite possible privacy-conscious users will opt out of Chrome cookies, just as they did with Apple’s ATT, which saw Facebook taking a $10 billion hit. Now, ATT opt-in rates range from 12 percent to 40 percent across different app categories. The mobile advertising industry has boomed over recent years, even with Apple’s ATT in place, says Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at security outfit ESET. He calls the results of ATT “impressive” and suggests Google has been watching the outcome of Apple’s rules before implementing its own version. Meanwhile, Google is already advising developers to act as if they don’t have cookies. The tech giant is working under the assumption that even if 80 percent do opt out, 20 percent of Chrome’s more than 3 billion users isn’t a bad result. Ensuring users have a conscious choice over whether they use cookies or not is “a good step in practice,” says Simon Bain, CEO at data and analytics platform OmniIndex. But Google needs to consider how easy it is to opt out, he says. “And is there a negative impact on opting out for users?” Bain says. “These are crucial because if opting out is buried in the privacy settings and there is a reduction in functionality or workflow as a result of not having them, then it is not really a fair or legitimate choice.” Google says its updated approach allows people to “make an informed choice that applies across their web browsing,” and says you’ll be able to “adjust that choice at any time.” The plan is for this to be as usable as possible. Sources familiar with the matter confirmed Google’s current plan would be a prominent global prompt, meaning users would not be asked to make choices on a site-by-site basis. Yet some experts question Google’s motives. Sean Wright, an independent security researcher, points out that Google has “an enormous amount of data on individuals,” which gives a lot of power to “a single entity.” This level of control could put user privacy at risk, Wright says. “My concern is that you have a large company that is already well established, developing its own ecosystem with little competition. There seems little incentive to enhance the privacy of users.” But Google argues that it has received feedback from “a wide variety of stakeholders,” including regulators such as the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority, publishers, web developers and standards groups, civil society, and participants in the advertising industry. “This has helped us craft solutions that aim to support a competitive and thriving marketplace that works for publishers and advertisers, and encourage the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies,” the company says. Even so, privacy is a difficult balance to strike for the world’s biggest browser whose business model is designed to rely on advertising. This is already well known, and if you care about your privacy, it’s possible you’ve already ditched Chrome for another browser. If you haven’t, Chrome alternatives include Apple’s Safari, Brave, Vivaldi, Firefox, and the DuckDuckGo browser. Brave and Vivaldi and based on the same Chromium engine as Chrome, so they include some of the same functionality.

            "content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. On a dead-end road that climbs out of the tiny city of Jenkins, in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in Eastern Kentucky, there stands a large warehouse with a mint green roof. It shares the road with a few other businesses, but is otherwise surrounded by an expanse of open fields and tree-lined slopes. Inside, the warehouse is stacked high with racks on racks of computers—thousands of them. But none have ever been switched on. The warehouse is owned by Mohawk Energy, a company cofounded by Kentucky state senator Brandon Smith in 2005, originally to resculpt landscapes disfigured by coal mining. After lying dormant for a period, Mohawk was reincarnated in 2022 when Smith struck a deal with HBTPower, a company then owned by Chinese crypto exchange Huobi, which wanted to use the warehouse for a bitcoin mining operation. Under the deal, Mohawk promised to fit up its warehouse with the necessary power infrastructure and repair any equipment that went down. In return, HBT would pay Mohawk a monthly hosting fee, a cut of its mining revenue, and the associated energy bills. Smith says he hoped the arrangement would generate tax revenue and create jobs for former coal miners, who could be trained as repair technicians. The coal industry departed Jenkins long ago, the reserves depleted, leaving people in search of work. More than a third now live below the poverty line, per the latest census data. “I liked the idea of going from one type of mining to a new type,” says Smith. “I thought, now in Eastern Kentucky we are going to have our time—we’re going to catch up and play a part in the tech future.” But after a promising start, the relationship between Mohawk and HBT soured and then fell apart. “Nothing has ever been turned on. It’s a fascinating, almost Willy Wonka–type atmosphere when you walk through,” says Smith. “It has turned into a disaster.” In November 2023, HBT brought a lawsuit in federal court, alleging that Mohawk had breached its contract on several fronts, including by failing to install the appropriate power infrastructure and secure certain power subsidies, and attempting to sell off the mining equipment. “Ultimately, the source of the current dispute is Mohawk’s basic failure to comply with its obligations, not only in a timely way, but at all in many regards,” says Harout Samra, a specialist in international dispute resolution at law firm DLA Piper and representative for HBT. Mohawk sued HBT in return, contesting the various alleged breaches and claiming that HBT is delinquent on more than $700,000 in rent, labor, and fit-up costs. The company is also seeking damages relating to the loss of income over the term of the contract and the inability to bring a new tenant into the facility while the equipment remains on-site. “Huobi simply made a bargain it believes now is a bad one, and wants to get out of it without paying the funds it owes,” the filing states. The legal conflict, which remains unresolved, is just one in a series of fights between Chinese companies and the owners of industrial facilities in the rural US over failed bitcoin mining partnerships. What looked to facility owners in Kentucky like an irresistible opportunity to tap into a new line of business in an otherwise fallow period has turned into a nightmare. They claim to have been saddled with unpaid hosting fees and energy bills worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, with few options for recovering the money. The Chinese parties have been left equally displeased. “HBTPower obviously regrets that this opportunity has ultimately played out the way it has,” says Samra. The bitcoin mining game—a race between computers to win the right to process a bundle of transactions and claim a crypto reward—is dominated by large corporations that own and operate industrial-scale facilities. But in 2021 and 2022, smaller-scale operations began to proliferate in the US countryside wherever there was available power, including in Kentucky. “A lot of mom-and-pop shops opened up,” says Phil Harvey, CEO at Sabre56, a firm that consults on crypto mining projects and operates its own facilities. “Appalachia has always been a good source of power.” These small facilities were plugging a gap in the market. A ban on crypto mining in China had left businesses casting about for a new home for their many millions of dollars’ worth of mining equipment. “A lot of wealthy Chinese businesses were affected,” says Harvey. “Every minute these machines are down, they are losing revenue.” Meanwhile, as the price of bitcoin ballooned—and the profitability of mining along with it—mining firms and investor groups began to hoard large quantities of bitcoin mining equipment of their own, says Harvey, without considering where they might deploy it. In an overheated market, holders of mining equipment jumped into hosting arrangements at short notice with owners of small facilities, some of whom had no prior experience and insufficient expertise, who agreed to install the equipment and run the mining operations on their behalf. But the haste with which these hosting relationships came together, in the name of striking while bitcoin was hot, says Harvey, set many of the partnerships up for failure. There was limited due diligence conducted by parties on both sides, delays in kitting out facilities and deploying equipment, and disputes over payment terms, he says, among other points of friction. “It's a snowball effect where everyone just ends up getting pissed off with each other,” says Harvey. Though the American market proved more expensive and bureaucratic than some Chinese businesses expected, says Harvey, problems were also caused by the hubris of facility owners, some of whom found themselves in over their heads. “It’s no joke running a [bitcoin mining] operation of any kind of scale,” he says. “Just because the Chinese are tough to do business with, doesn’t mean they are the ones in the wrong. I would say that blame is equally shared.” The law firm acting for Mohawk in its dispute with HBT, Anna Whites Law Office, has represented multiple owners of small facilities in Kentucky in similar legal conflicts with Chinese partners. The cases differ from the Mohawk situation, says attorney Anna Whites, founder of the firm, but share a common thread: “We saw a pattern that [companies with ties to China] would ship in machines with uncertain provenance, mine very heavily for three months, then run without paying the bill,” she claims. Some of the cases settled out of court; Whites is unable to supply the details for reasons of client confidentiality. But others continue to drag on. Biofuel Mining, a company formerly co-owned by Smith, is involved in legal tangles with two companies that Whites believes to be run out of China: Touzi Tech and VCV Power Gamma. Although both are incorporated in Delaware, per SEC filings, they conduct business in Mandarin and cannot be reached at their listed US addresses, Whites claims. “It's pretty standard for the foreign entities from any country to get a short-term office so that they have less scrutiny from US investors and government agencies,” she says. In both cases, Biofuel claims, the firms shipped equipment from China to its hosting facility in Eastern Kentucky, then walked away with the bitcoin produced, leaving behind hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid energy bills and hosting fees. Biofuel reached a settlement with Touzi in early 2022 for $60,000, but despite having handed back the mining equipment, it claims not to have received the sum it is owed under the agreement. In the still-unresolved spat with VCV, Biofuel received permission from the Martin County Circuit Court in Kentucky to sell off the mining equipment, claims Whites, to recoup a portion of the funds it is owed (she has not confirmed the amount), but she alleges that no damages have yet been awarded. VCV has stopped responding to communications, she claims. Biofuel has since dissolved, put out of business by the failed hosting ventures. “I literally lost my house—I lost everything. It financially ruined me,” says Wes Hamilton, former Biofuel Mining CEO. “I’m just so frustrated about the whole thing.” WIRED contacted VCV and Touzi for comment, but did not receive any response. There are few financial recovery options for companies like Mohawk and Biofuel. The situation is made more difficult, as in the Mohawk case, if they are dealing with so-called special purpose entities. Because they are set up by their parent companies for a single specific business venture, these entities need not be concerned about their long-term ability to operate in the US. “It certainly can be more difficult to recover damages from a non-US counterparty,” says Kim Havlin, a partner in the global commercial litigation practice at law firm White & Case. “There is certainly a risk that an entity that doesn’t need to be in the US may just ignore the case.” Even if the Kentucky facility owners win out in court, it could be difficult to collect any damages awarded. “A judgment is essentially a piece of paper. Any judgment needs to be turned into assets or cash in order to be valuable,” says Havlin. If the opposing party refuses to pay up and has no US assets to collect against, sometimes that isn’t possible. Almost a year after the dispute began, the Mohawk case is stuck in legal limbo. In a setback for Mohawk, the presiding judge recently denied its motion to dismiss HBT’s complaint, on the basis that it had failed to sufficiently back up its argument. The judge also pushed Mohawk’s countersuit into arbitration, a forum for resolving disputes privately instead of in open court. Non-US parties tend to prefer arbitration as a way to “remove a home forum from both sides,” explains Havlin. “You can pick an arbitral seat in neither country as a means of creating a neutral playing field.” A parallel federal court hearing is set for December to consider whether an injunction should be imposed on Mohawk, preventing it from selling off the remaining HBT equipment in its possession. Smith has given up on the idea of recovering the full amount he claims to be owed. “We’re at the point that it’s almost silly to even be arguing about breaking even,” he says. In an interview with PBS that aired in September 2023, touting the Mohawk Energy facility, Smith said he hoped to prove that not every business that blew into Jenkins would abandon the area. “I’ve stood at their ribbon cuttings, then watched them leave. I’d like to do something to let people know that not everybody is like that,” he said. After the relationship with HBT collapsed last year, Smith faces the prospect of Mohawk becoming yet another false start. With the facility inactive, the company has been forced to dismiss the former coal miners brought on as technicians. (It is unclear how many people it employed.) The Mohawk facility was perhaps never set to revitalize Jenkins in the way Smith hoped, anyway. “I would say that a rural community benefits very little from a bitcoin mining facility. In terms of job creation, it’s minimal in a lot of cases,” says Harvey, the consultant. “It's certainly not the savior to a dwindling community.” Nonetheless, Smith remains hopeful of salvaging the crypto mining project, with a new partner. “I’m hoping that this gets settled in the way that it should and that somebody comes forward and lets us go through with the vision that we wanted for this region,” he says. “I hope every day that maybe some big company will see that there's a place ready to go in this part of the country.” Otherwise, Mohawk’s dalliance with bitcoin mining will become a cautionary tale. “It was very hurtful to see these families lose their income. We were one of the biggest payrolls in Jenkins,” says Smith. “It adds insult to injury that I’m sitting here arguing in court.” Correction: 10/23/2024 11 AM EDT: The piece has been updated to clarify Mohawk's day to day responsibilities with regards to equipment maintenance.

She had recently got a promotion at work, and is now a senior manager at a respectable record label earning six figures. The bag was a celebratory gift, she told me, only it wasn’t Bottega—it was a dupe. As someone who has a closet full of designer labels—and who could certainly afford to buy the real thing—her admission surprised me. My face must have given that away. “It’s real Italian leather,” she quickly followed up, “and their website says they manufacture in the same factories as some luxury brands. You couldn’t tell the difference, so why would I spend thousands more for basically the same thing?” It’s a question many have been asking since dupe culture went supernova over the last few years. A shorthand for duplicate, dupes are cheaper alternatives that are basically the same as the real thing. Think of it as a cousin to counterfeit culture, but instead of being a cheap knock-off that infringes on a brand’s trademark, they’re uncannily similar imitations—promising the same qualities of the product at a fraction of the cost. It’s not just my friend who loves them either. Roughly one-third of all US adults have intentionally bought a dupe, according to Morning Consult, with that figure rising to almost half for Gen Z shoppers and 44% for millennials. In the UK, research by Mintel shows 47% of consumers are now open to buying luxury lookalikes in 2024, compared to just 12% in 2016. “The shame of buying these things has gone,” says Alice Sherwood, author of Authenticity: Reclaiming Reality in a Counterfeit Culture. “Luxury prices have skyrocketed while the trend cycle has rapidly accelerated. People no longer want to spend upwards of £4000 on the latest ‘It’ bag that might be out of vogue within a year.” Add their proliferation on social media into that mix, and the dupe culture has been normalised in ways that “knock-offs” from Canal Street never were, she says. Just one scroll on TikTok would affirm this. At the time of writing over 260,000 posts have been made under the #dupes hashtag, with the majority featuring creators sharing their best dupe finds across fashion, beauty, lifestyle and homeware. Most of the time they’re from fast fashion retailers like Shein, Amazon and Temu, but more recently, a new crop of companies have been dominating dupe culture by offering quite a different proposition. Take my friend’s new favourite brand, Quince. According to their website their mission is “to create products of equal or greater quality than the leading luxury brands at a much lower price”. To do so they’ve sourced factories used by “well-known luxury brands” to manufacture their goods, but by cutting out the middlemen and hefty markup, they can sell them at far more affordable prices. Quince's $100 handwoven Italian leather Hobo bag is a convincing dupe of the Bottega Jodie, which costs upwards of $2,800. They’re not the only ones. Leather goods manufacturer Sitoy Group Holdings regularly uploads videos on social media showcasing how the quality of its $100 handbags is almost identical to those sold for upwards of $1000, all the while advertising that they use the same production lines used by Prada, Tumi and Michael Kors. Then there's Chicjoc, one of the largest Chinese fashion apparel brands on Taobao and Tmall, claiming it uses the same fabric manufacturers as those used by the likes of Chanel, Valentino and Louis Vuitton. This shift towards high-quality dupes puts luxury brands in a difficult position. For decades, they’ve justified their high prices with the promise of superior craftsmanship and materials. They've even poked fun at these imitations. But when brands are offering near-identical goods allegedly manufactured in the same factory as luxury brands for much, much less, that justification starts to crumble. Another brand that has gained significant traction online this year is Los Angeles-based premium basics brand, Italic, with many consumers on Reddit expressing their satisfaction with the quality of the products. “Most of our products take 5–10 sample runs and 6–18 months, sometimes even longer,” says Italic CEO Jeremy Cai. “Our sourcing process involves rigorous vetting and ongoing quality controls, including factory certifications, samples, and production quality.” Italic doesn't market itself as a “dupe” brand, but its $200 Mongolian cashmere sweater claims to use comparable fabric to Cucinelli's $2300 version. This meticulous approach stands in stark contrast to what many might expect. Italic contacts 20-30 potential suppliers, evaluates 5-7 factories, and ultimately works with just 1-2 of them for any given product category, visiting each factory on-site. The key difference between Italic and the high-profile brands using the same factories, Cai explains, is in the pricing: “Most of our factories' clients sell for 2-4x more than our SRPs (Suggested Retail Prices), often much higher.” By cutting out the markup typically associated with luxury goods, Italic offers high-quality products at a more accessible price point. Cai is quick to point out that Italic does not market itself as a “dupe” brand. However, that hasn’t stopped consumers from drawing comparisons to more expensive luxury labels. In contrast, competitor Quince leans into dupe culture, positioning itself more overtly as a challenger to high-end brands. On Quince's website, woven intrecciato handbags, which resemble Bottega Veneta's iconic designs, are showcased alongside price comparisons to their luxury counterparts. Quince also frequently analyses luxury competitors’ best-selling items to identify opportunities for replication. “Data collection is crucial in our product development process,” says a Quince spokesperson. “Our team uses a variety of sources, including Google Trends, social media, and customer feedback, to understand the market and ensure we’re delivering what people want.” Quince’s strategy is built on the belief that luxury can—and should—be more accessible. “Our founding team, with years of experience in luxury and DTC (direct-to-consumer) retail, knew that competitors add a 40–60% markup on similar products,” continues the spokesperson. “As costs in the luxury market become more transparent, consumers are less willing to accept these inflated prices.” To that end, Quince works globally to source manufacturing partners that share their commitment to transparency, while innovating to keep costs down. Every product page on their site includes detailed information about materials, country of origin, and certifications for working conditions along the supply chain. Luxury brands, on the other hand, have traditionally kept their manufacturing processes shrouded in secrecy. William Lasry, founder of Glass Factory, is working to change that. Lasry travels the globe, visiting and spotlighting factories with superior craftsmanship and ethical practices across his social media platforms. While not all brands are doing their very best, he is sceptical about some companies' supposed connections to luxury factories, pointing out that these dupe brands frequently exploit this ambiguity for marketing purposes. “There are many instances where a factory will produce a sample for a luxury brand,” Lasry explains. “Luxury brands often request samples from hundreds of factories, but in many cases, nothing materialises beyond the sample stage. The factory might then turn around and claim, ‘We’ve made samples for Gucci,’ even though no production deal was ever finalised.” Petros Analytis, head of research at Glass Factory, agrees that it’s hard to draw the line. “Unless they let us come into the factories and see for ourselves, it’s hard to ascertain.” While transparency might be slowly improving, one thing the luxury market has always clung onto is its appeal. Conglomerates like LVMH and Kering built empires on the foundation of an alluring narrative—one that combines centuries of heritage with modern-day prestige. By blending Old World craftsmanship with the new-age glamour of celebrity culture, they made handbags, shoes, and clothing a gateway to an elite, exclusive world. For a long time consumers were happy to pay big bucks to belong in this world. Perhaps unknowingly, they were buying not just a product but an experience. The true value of a designer label wasn't simply measured by the stitching or material, but by the feeling it evoked—the confidence boost, the social status, the feeling of exclusivity. “It’s a real skill to make a handbag into an object desired by millions of women, one that has so much meaning and can do so much for your self-confidence,” notes Sherwood. The Hermés Birkin bag is one of the most desired handbags on the luxury market. Yet, behind the curtain of glamour, the reality of some products was very different. While consumers believed they were buying the pinnacle of luxury, what they were often getting was a product only marginally superior to midrange alternatives—and occasionally no better at all. The excessively high margins were less a reflection of quality and more a tax on the brands' appeal. “They are the architects of their own problems,” continues Sherwood. “By making so much of their products not about the tangible product, but about the intangible aspects of the brands - those sexy ads, the celebs who carry your products, the stores, the glossy ads, the slogans, the heritage backstory, all that stuff that isn’t actually the product itself.” In turn they’ve created an enormous gap between what consumers are actually paying for and the real value of the product. As these companies have increasingly pursued the ultra-wealthy, they’ve left a gap in the market that other brands, eager to capitalise, are starting to fill. “They know that the prices at the very top of luxury are too high to reflect the actual value,” Sherwood says. “But have turned these notable silhouettes and styles into desirable items that a dupe brand can free ride off of.” Then, recently, the veneer began to crack even further. In March, Italian luxury brand Loro Piana became embroiled in scandal after an investigation revealed the material behind their $9,000 sweaters was sourced by low-paid workers in Peru. Just a few months later, in July, Italian prosecutors alleged sweatshop-like conditions in factories supplying certain products for high-end labels such as Dior and Armani. The revelations triggered outrage among consumers, many of whom had long trusted these brands to uphold the highest standards of craftsmanship and ethics. Across online forums like the r/handbag subreddit, once-loyal customers voiced their disillusionment. For many, these scandals revealed that the luxury brands they idolised were not living up to their promises. Both Loro Piana and Dior have denied the allegations. However, The Business of Fashion revealed that Milan's public prosecutor said in a court document that they had found “an illegal practice so entrenched and proven [that it could] be considered part of a broader business policy exclusively aimed at increasing profit.” Neither company has been charged in relation to the probe. Such reputational damage couldn’t have come at a worse time for luxury brands. Coupled with the rise of dupe culture, these scandals are forcing consumers to rethink their relationship with high-end goods. If craftsmanship is no longer exceptional, and ethical practices are called into question, what exactly are people paying for when they buy luxury? Recent sales figures underline just how far demand for luxury mega-brands has fallen from its post-pandemic highs. In July, some of the industry’s biggest players reported disappointing revenues for the second consecutive quarter. LVMH, the world’s leading luxury conglomerate, missed sales estimates, while Gucci’s parent company Kering, experienced a decline of 11%. Other major brands like Richemont and Burberry also reported disappointing figures, with first-quarter sales plummeting by a staggering 20%. At the heart of luxury’s current struggles is the erosion of the very dream that once propelled the industry. The disconnect between the marketing mythology and the reality of production has left consumers feeling disillusioned, meaning the days of blindly paying a premium for a logo may be at risk. The democratisation of information and consumer power through social media has played a huge part in this. Platforms like TikTok and Reddit are filled with conversations that challenge the industry's value proposition, which has made it so much harder for luxury brands to control their narrative. To regain their position, Brittany Steiger, principal analyst of retail & eCommerce at Mintel says they will need to focus on what once made them so desirable—authenticity, superior craftsmanship, and a narrative of prestige that feels both aspirational and attainable. Some experts suggest that embracing more transparent practices and truly living up to their ethical and quality promises could also be the way forward. Brands that fail to do so, may find themselves increasingly irrelevant in a world where high-quality dupes continue to gain ground. It’s clear that the old model of luxury has been disrupted, and it’s no longer just about price anymore. In the battle between heritage and value, consumers are asking more questions—and luxury brands must have better answers. And if they don’t, there’s a whole industry on the sidelines who do.

            "content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. On Thursday evening, at around 7 pm Pacific time, Tesla is slated to unveil the newest vehicle in its lineup: one that will be able to drive itself. A purpose-built Tesla robot taxi—a Cybercab, in the electric automaker’s parlance—is meant to establish the company as less a manufacturer of cars than a maker of pathbreaking robotics technology. “The way to think of Tesla is almost entirely in terms of solving autonomy and being able to turn on that autonomy for a gigantic fleet,” CEO Elon Musk told Tesla investors in April. As Musk takes the stage Thursday at the Warner Bros. Discovery movie studio in Burbank, California, and attempts to usher that substantial (and difficult) vision into reality, canny observers should keep watch for information about Tesla’s service that extends beyond the vehicle itself—the robot devil will likely be in the robot details. Ride-hailing services are logistically complex, governed by liability laws and state-by-state regulations. Sometimes, robot taxis are attacked by vandals. To run a robotaxi fleet, Tesla will have to work out all of those pieces. The Tesla robotaxi has been a long time coming. Musk made his first promise about a self-driving, Uber-like service back in 2019, when he said that Tesla would have 1 million robotaxis on the road by the end of 2020. At the time, the idea was that the automaker would be able to effectively “flip a switch” to transform on-the-road Teslas into autonomous robots able to do their drivers’ bidding—including pick up fares!—during down times. This past April, Musk announced the official Cybercab reveal would take place in August, then he delayed it after saying the vehicle needed design tweaks. Now, Tesla has made a purpose-built autonomous electric vehicle, owned and operated by the company itself, more central to its future robotaxi fleet. Musk has likened the business model to a mix of Airbnb and Uber, but maintains, as he said in April, that “there will be some number of cars that Tesla owns itself and operates in the fleet.” Tesla has shown renderings depicting what a self-driving robotaxi app might look like. And earlier this year, Tesla AI head Ashok Elluswamy intimated that the automaker had at least a sense of the challenge ahead, when he acknowledged to investors that Cybercabs will need to be charged, cleaned, and maintained in between ferrying passengers about day and night. Who will do that, and where? And who will pay for it? A self-driving ride-hail service would put Tesla in direct competition with other tech developers with years’ worth of head starts. Alphabet subsidiary Waymo says it’s providing 100,000 paid trips per week in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. It has plans to launch in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta, Georgia, next year. Amazon’s Zoox is testing its purpose-built, toaster-shaped robotaxi in Las Vegas, and has said it will launch an autonomous taxi service later this year. There may be a “last mover” advantage, though; perhaps Tesla can learn from what other self-driving developers have done poorly, and well. Waymo, which does not make its own vehicles but installs self-driving tech on other automakers’ EVs, has zeroed in on a business model that could leave the Google sister company responsible for just tech development. Last month, Waymo announced a partnership with Uber, which should see self-driving vehicles running on the ride-hail company’s platform in Atlanta and Austin by the end of next year. Waymo would retain control of the self-driving technology and some rider support functions, the companies said, but Uber will provide “fleet management services”—vehicle cleaning, repair, and other depot operations. In this arrangement, a single entity would not be responsible for the workings of an entire robot ride-hailing fleet. There may also be a lesson to learn about playing nice with regulators. Another competitor, General Motors’ Cruise, suffered serious setbacks after regulators accused the self-driving vehicle developer of obscuring details of a gruesome October 2023 collision that critically injured a pedestrian, an incident that led to more than $1 million in federal fines, lost operating permits in the state of California, serious shakeups in the firm’s executive ranks, and a multimillion-dollar settlement for the crash victim. Cruise has been back-testing its autonomous tech in Arizona and Texas since earlier this spring. But the fallout from the collision demonstrates the perils of angering regulators while deploying new technology on public roads. Tesla does not seem to have gotten in touch with crucial California autonomous vehicle regulators about a robotaxi service, despite basing its engineering headquarters in Palo Alto. A spokesperson for the California Public Utilities Commission, which licenses ride-hail operations in the state, said the agency hasn’t had contact with the company about autonomous permits. Tesla does have a permit to test autonomous vehicles in the state of California through the Department of Motor Vehicles, but last year the company didn’t report any autonomous driving miles to the state. Waymo, Zoox, and even Cruise and Apple (which shut down its self-driving car project earlier this year) each reported thousands of miles driven.

In what may be a first, the US Department of Justice this week charged a hacker with attempting to cause injury and death by launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against hospitals. Ahmed Omer and his brother Alaa are accused of carrying out a cyberattack spree that targeted hundreds of victims under the hacktivist banner Anonymous Sudan. The group’s DDoS victims included Microsoft’s Azure cloud services, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and Israel’s missile alert system, according to prosecutors. It was the brothers’ alleged attacks on hospitals, however, that drew the most serious accusations from the Justice Department, which singled out Ahmed for allegedly seeking to kill people with the crude cyberattacks that overwhelm systems, knocking them offline. If someone told you there’s a tool that can—using only open source information—create a “cyber profile” of you that can locate your phone in real time or place you at the scene of a crime at any date in the past, would you believe them? Canadian firm Global Intelligence claims to have created such a tool, dubbed Cybercheck, which it has sold to police departments across the US. Cybercheck-generated reports have been used to help convict at least two people of murder. However, a WIRED investigation found that Cybercheck’s reports have produced information that is either inaccurate or impossible to verify. And open source experts say some of the information Cybercheck claims to include—such as a device’s pings to a specific wireless network—would be impossible to obtain from publicly available sources. The scourge of nonconsensual deepfake images has continued to proliferate, including on Telegram, where millions of people used “nudify” bots to “remove the clothes” of anyone—usually women and girls. A WIRED investigation identified 50 such bots and 25 channels linked to the creation of these abusive AI-generated explicit images. Telegram removed all 75 channels and bots after WIRED reached out, but many of them will likely respawn. The slow death of the password may have gotten a speed boost this week. The FIDO Alliance, a tech industry association, announced new efforts to help hasten the adoption of passkeys, the cryptographically generated codes that are already replacing less-secure passwords. These efforts include a new Credential Exchange Protocol, which makes it easier to migrate passkeys between platforms and devices, and Passkey Central, a resource for company IT departments that aims to make it easier for organizations to adopt passkeys. A group of researchers revealed this week that they created an algorithm that generates a malicious prompt capable of instructing an AI chatbot to identify personal information fed into it by a user and secretly send it to an attacker. Finally, we went back in time to explore how well the US Army’s “solider of tomorrow,” unveiled 65 years ago this week, predicted the future of US military tech. And that’s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there. If you use uBlock Origin’s Chrome extension to filter out online ads, expect to get mildly annoyed in the near future. Google has begun implementing new Chrome extension standards, called Manifest V3, that will disable the legacy version of uBlock Origin’s extension that most users likely have installed. And while you might be thinking, “Google is a silverback gorilla of online advertising, of course they’re finally forcing me to see ads!” there is some good news. A new version of the ad-filtering extension that meets the Manifest V3 standards, uBlock Origin Lite, is now available. Then again, it won’t block as much as the previous iteration of uBlock. Still, as a Google spokesperson told The Verge, you have options: “The top content filtering extensions all have Manifest V3 versions available — with options for users of AdBlock, Adblock Plus, uBlock Origin and AdGuard.” Either way, you’ll need to install a new extension soon. US authorities announced charges this week against a 25-year-old Alabama man accused of hacking the Security and Exchange Commission’s X account. Prosecutors claim Eric Council Jr. obtained personal information and the materials for a fake ID of a person who controlled the @SECGov account from unidentified coconspirators. Council allegedly used the fake ID to carry out a SIM-swapping attack, duping AT&T retail store staff into giving him a new SIM card, which he ultimately used to take control of the victim’s phone account. The coconspirators used that to gain access to the SEC’s X account, where they posted a fake announcement about Bitcoin’s regulatory status, which was followed by a price jump of $1,000 per bitcoin. Council stands charged of conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud. The grocery store chain Kroger has never used facial-recognition technology broadly in its stores and has no current plans to, a spokesperson told Fast Company this week. The company has been facing a firestorm over its use of electronic shelving labels over concerns that ESLs could be used to impose surge pricing on popular items, and fears that the devices could also be deployed with facial recognition. The company did a single-store facial-recognition pilot of a technology called EDGE in 2019, but it did not move forward with the service. US lawmakers including Rashida Tlaib, Elizabeth Warren, and Robert Casey have publicly raised concerns about Kroger’s use of ESLs. Microsoft told customers that it failed to capture more than two weeks of security logs from certain cloud services in September, including Microsoft Entra, Sentinel, Defender for Cloud, and Purview. News of the lost logs was first reported by Business Insider. The company said in the notification that “a bug in one of Microsoft’s internal monitoring agents resulted in a malfunction in some of the agents when uploading log data to our internal logging platform.” The blank extends from September 2 to September 19. A Microsoft executive confirmed to TechCrunch that the incident was caused by an “operational bug within our internal monitoring agent.” System activity logs are crucial for all sorts of operations and are particularly used for security monitoring and investigations, because they can expose breaches and malicious activity. After Russian hackers breached US government networks through SolarWinds software in 2020, many agencies couldn’t detect the activity in their Microsoft Azure cloud services because they weren’t paying for Microsoft’s premium tier features, so they didn’t have adequate network activity logs. Lawmakers were outraged about the up-charge, and the Biden administration worked for more than two years to get Microsoft to make the logging services free. The company ultimately announced the change in July 2023.

            "content": "To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. On Saturday, an Associated Press investigation revealed that OpenAI's Whisper transcription tool creates fabricated text in medical and business settings despite warnings against such use. The AP interviewed more than 12 software engineers, developers, and researchers who found the model regularly invents text that speakers never said, a phenomenon often called a “confabulation” or “hallucination” in the AI field. Upon its release in 2022, OpenAI claimed that Whisper approached “human level robustness” in audio transcription accuracy. However, a University of Michigan researcher told the AP that Whisper created false text in 80 percent of public meeting transcripts examined. Another developer, unnamed in the AP report, claimed to have found invented content in almost all of his 26,000 test transcriptions. The fabrications pose particular risks in health care settings. Despite OpenAI’s warnings against using Whisper for “high-risk domains,” over 30,000 medical workers now use Whisper-based tools to transcribe patient visits, according to the AP report. The Mankato Clinic in Minnesota and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles are among 40 health systems using a Whisper-powered AI copilot service from medical tech company Nabla that is fine-tuned on medical terminology. This story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast. Nabla acknowledges that Whisper can confabulate, but it also reportedly erases original audio recordings “for data safety reasons.” This could cause additional issues, since doctors cannot verify accuracy against the source material. And deaf patients may be highly impacted by mistaken transcripts since they would have no way to know if medical transcript audio is accurate or not. The potential problems with Whisper extend beyond health care. Researchers from Cornell University and the University of Virginia studied thousands of audio samples and found Whisper adding nonexistent violent content and racial commentary to neutral speech. They found that 1 percent of samples included “entire hallucinated phrases or sentences which did not exist in any form in the underlying audio” and that 38 percent of those included “explicit harms such as perpetuating violence, making up inaccurate associations, or implying false authority.” In one case from the study cited by AP, when a speaker described “two other girls and one lady,” Whisper added fictional text specifying that they “were Black.” In another, the audio said, “He, the boy, was going to, I’m not sure exactly, take the umbrella.” Whisper transcribed it to, “He took a big piece of a cross, a teeny, small piece … I’m sure he didn’t have a terror knife so he killed a number of people.” An OpenAI spokesperson told the AP that the company appreciates the researchers’ findings and that it actively studies how to reduce fabrications and incorporates feedback in updates to the model. The key to Whisper’s unsuitability in high-risk domains comes from its propensity to sometimes confabulate, or plausibly make up, inaccurate outputs. The AP report says, \"Researchers aren’t certain why Whisper and similar tools hallucinate,\" but that isn't true. We know exactly why Transformer-based AI models like Whisper behave this way. Whisper is based on technology that is designed to predict the next most likely token (chunk of data) that should appear after a sequence of tokens provided by a user. In the case of ChatGPT, the input tokens come in the form of a text prompt. In the case of Whisper, the input is tokenized audio data. The transcription output from Whisper is a prediction of what is most likely, not what is most accurate. Accuracy in Transformer-based outputs is typically proportional to the presence of relevant accurate data in the training dataset, but it is never guaranteed. If there is ever a case where there isn't enough contextual information in its neural network for Whisper to make an accurate prediction about how to transcribe a particular segment of audio, the model will fall back on what it “knows” about the relationships between sounds and words it has learned from its training data. According to OpenAI in 2022, Whisper learned those statistical relationships from “680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web.” But we now know a little more about the source. Given Whisper's well-known tendency to produce certain outputs like \"thank you for watching,\" \"like and subscribe,\" or \"drop a comment in the section below\" when provided silent or garbled inputs, it's likely that OpenAI trained Whisper on thousands of hours of captioned audio scraped from YouTube videos. (The researchers needed audio paired with existing captions to train the model.) There's also a phenomenon called “overfitting” in AI models where information (in this case, text found in audio transcriptions) encountered more frequently in the training data is more likely to be reproduced in an output. In cases where Whisper encounters poor-quality audio in medical notes, the AI model will produce what its neural network predicts is the most likely output, even if it is incorrect. And the most likely output for any given YouTube video, since so many people say it, is “thanks for watching.” In other cases, Whisper seems to draw on the context of the conversation to fill in what should come next, which can lead to problems because its training data could include racist commentary or inaccurate medical information. For example, if many examples of training data featured speakers saying the phrase “crimes by Black criminals,” when Whisper encounters a “crimes by [garbled audio] criminals” audio sample, it will be more likely to fill in the transcription with “Black.\" In the original Whisper model card, OpenAI researchers wrote about this very phenomenon: \"Because the models are trained in a weakly supervised manner using large-scale noisy data, the predictions may include texts that are not actually spoken in the audio input (i.e. hallucination). We hypothesize that this happens because, given their general knowledge of language, the models combine trying to predict the next word in audio with trying to transcribe the audio itself.\" So in that sense, Whisper \"knows\" something about the content of what is being said and keeps track of the context of the conversation, which can lead to issues like the one where Whisper identified two women as being Black even though that information was not contained in the original audio. Theoretically, this erroneous scenario could be reduced by using a second AI model trained to pick out areas of confusing audio where the Whisper model is likely to confabulate and flag the transcript in that location, so a human could manually check those instances for accuracy later. Clearly, OpenAI's advice not to use Whisper in high-risk domains, such as critical medical records, was a good one. But health care companies are constantly driven by a need to decrease costs by using seemingly \"good enough\" AI tools—as we've seen with Epic Systems using GPT-4 for medical records and UnitedHealth using a flawed AI model for insurance decisions. It's entirely possible that people are already suffering negative outcomes due to AI mistakes, and fixing them will likely involve some sort of regulation and certification of AI tools used in the medical field.

As I describe in our Best Hair Straighteners guide, this is one of the only flat irons I’ve ever tried that can straighten my difficult curls in a single pass and keep them that way. The titanium plates—which heat up in around 23 seconds to 450 degrees Fahrenheit—feature a small inlaid infrared strip, which Sutra says helps to seal the hair cuticle. This is the first time I’ve seen this iron on sale, so it’s a great buy if you have thick, unruly hair like I do and are ready for an iron that can take care of business in just a pass or two. Just make sure you also pick up a heat protectant if you don’t already have one—we recommend Curlsmith Miracle Shield. If you have straight or wavy hair and already know a blow-dryer brush works for your texture, Shark's FlexStyle is a worthy upgrade that combines a hair dryer, two brushes, and two auto-wrap hair curlers in one—designed to cut a significant amount of time and storage space. It may seem pricey, but as our Gear Team testers mention in our Best Hair Straighteners guide, this is basically a perfect dupe of the enduringly popular Dyson Airwap multi-styler (see below), which is twice the price—making the highly rated FlexStyle an even better deal at its sale price of $235. The Tymo Airflow is a great hair straightener that can double as a curler, too, thanks to the rounded barrel. I like a smooth undercurl when I straighten my hair, and the Tymo Airflow is perfect to achieve that for me. I’ve especially loved using it with short hair, but it worked well for my long hair too. The heat settings range from 284 degrees to 428 degrees Fahrenheit, and Tymo includes a little guide on which heat setting to use based on your hair type. While it looks more like a curler, it performs best as a straightener. It did give my hair some soft curls when I used it curling-iron style, though. —Nena Farrell T3 SinglePass Smooth X One of the better Prime Day hair deals, this icy-pink straightener not only looks stylish, its plates are longer (4½ inches, compared with the 4 inches on most irons) but still narrow at 1 inch, allowing for more surface area without sacrificing maneuverability. Nine heat settings with an internal microchip to control fluctuations and a special finish to add shine round out the features. I didn't have a ton of success using this on my curls, but my mom has fine waves and this is her favorite flat iron. The StyleMax has a number of factors that are similar to its sibling above, like the same rose-gold accents and proprietary CeraGloss plates. It does have a much wider range of temperature control options, which is great if you have fine or delicate hair and are especially worried about damage. Just be sure to keep the manual so you can make sure you know what, er, all of the lights mean.—Adrienne So My favorite flat iron for touch-ups, this was the top overall pick in our Best Hair Straighteners guide. The 1-inch ceramic plates top out at 410 degrees Fahrenheit, and the compact body is easy to maneuver in the event you want to add some waves. If you want a higher-end straightener but are put off by the idea of spending upwards of $150, this is both a great iron and a great deal at under $100. This Chi is not only a perpetual Amazon bestseller, it's beloved by both former WIRED contributor Victoria Woollaston-Webber and myself. I had one for more than a decade, and it somehow still made short work of my 3a curls, despite its max temperature being only 392 degrees Fahrenheit. If you've been working with $20 drugstore models, as I myself did during much of my twenties, this is a worthy investment and excellent entry into the world of more upscale hair straighteners. I’ve been using Dyson’s Airstrait (8/10, WIRED Recommends) exclusively on my hair for over a year now. It has the same form factor as a standard flat iron, but it uses airflow to dry and straighten your hair simultaneously instead of hot plates. You can also pick between two main styling modes (wet and dry) as well as three temperature settings. Whenever I wash my hair, I’ll set it to wet mode to fully dry it and then switch to dry mode to flatten out any puffiness. It’s allowed me to cut my full hair routine from 45 minutes to 15 minutes. —Brenda Stolyar This straightener is expensive, but it's a great option if you're worried about hair damage. It comes with a proprietary temperature-finding feature called HeatID Technology. On the iron's handle, you can select your hair features, length, and whether your hair is color-treated. It will then suggest the appropriate heat level to straighten your hair. We also love the Refresh mode feature, which touches up your hair at a lower temperature based on previous settings. —Brenda Stolyar The Double Straight is a bit unique since it has a four-plate design. The first two plates straighten your hair, while the second two “reinforce” the style. This allows you to make two passes simultaneously, which reduces the time it takes to style your hair and the risk of heat damage. It also comes with the most temperature settings of any straighteners we've tested—you'll have 10 to choose from, ranging from 85 degrees Fahrenheit (140 Celsius) up to 455 degrees Fahrenheit (235 Celsius). —Brenda Stolyar Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano was quite impressed by this dryer, which is more powerful than it looks and folds up small enough to fit in a purse. Though she didn't love using it on her curly hair, as she points out in our guide to Best Hair Dryers, she still thought it was perfect for those with straight or wavy hair, or as a travel dryer. As featured in our guide to Best Hair Dryers, this compact dryer features accessories that magnetically attach to the dryer body, including a comb and a diffuser for styling curly hair, plus a handy digital display on the back that shows the exact temperature. In fact, the only downside our tester could find was the price, so this is a great grab at $60 off. Even though former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano points out (not incorrectly) that everything about the Bed Head brand screams ’90s, she liked this purple-and-neon-yellow hair dryer for its ability to dry her curls without disrupting their pattern. She also liked that it was lightweight with an unusually large 4-inch-wide mouth. Granted, $4 off isn’t exactly a groundbreaking sale, but if you’re looking for an inexpensive hair dryer specifically for curls, this is a decent option. T3 is a popular brand in the hair tool space for good reason, and this white-and-rose gold ionic hairdryer was one of our top picks in our Best Hair Dryers guide. The Gear team testers loved how it felt lightweight and effortless to use, and the fact that it comes with its own flat and round brushes for styling makes this an even more impressive deal than it already is. T3's Featherweight StyleMax really is lightweight—my arms don't ache as I dry my hair with this one. It's made of plastic to keep it lightweight, but it doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. It also comes with a nice set of attachments, including a diffuser that I love using, plus two concentrators and a smoothing comb. It's a great blow dryer if you alternate between diffusing your hair and doing a classic blowout. —Nena Farrell Many people with curly hair are familiar with diffusers that attach to hair dryers, but they may not have seen a hair dryer that itself is actually shaped like a diffuser—this unique tool combines them both in one trendy-looking gold package. Despite the Diffon’s having no handle, former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano describes it as being comfortable to use, and in our Best Hair Dryers guide, she said it styled her curls well without adding frizz or puffiness. The gentle airflow settings may take some extra time to dry thick or voluminous hair, as was the case for Medea, but this could be an excellent solution for those with thinner or finer hair, especially if it’s on sale. This is one of our favorite hair dryers for reducing frizz. It comes with two air concentrator nozzles that help distribute heat and airflow, so it doesn't overdry the hair. Instead, the attachments help to create a shiny and smooth look. The hottest heat setting doesn't feel like it's burning your scalp either. —Brenda Stolyar We love this curling iron for its versatility. In addition to the styler handle, it comes with three attachments, including a 0.5-inch barrel for tight, defined curls; a 1.25-inch barrel for soft, natural curls; and a 1.5-inch barrel for larger curls and waves (which comes with a clip to help keep hair in place). Although you can pick a specific temperature, it does come with nine different heat settings that range from 260° to 410° Fahrenheit. It's a great option for a variety of hair types and is super easy to use.—Brenda Stolyar As our tester notes in our guide to Best Curling Irons, this budget iron is infused with argan oil and keratin for extra shine. We also appreciated the inclusion of a heat glove, as well as a tapered barrel, 10 heat settings with a digital display, and longer handle for added maneuverability. It comes in three sizes, but for larger, looser curls and waves, our tester recommends the 1-1.5 inch size.—Brenda Stolyar We recommend this one for long-lasting curls. With a 1-inch ceramic barrel, it's small enough for short hairstyles but large enough for creating curls in longer, thicker hair. The clamp and easy-to-use handle also keep the hair in place as you twist it and the cool tip is larger than other curlers we've tried. It's tapered too, which helps you know how close you are to the hot metal barrel while creating curls—if your fingers are on the thin end, you're further away; grabbing the thicker end means you have a higher risk of accidentally burning yourself.—Brenda Stolyar The Dyson Airwrap (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the multi-tool that can do it all—a simple wand that comes with six attachments ranging from different-sized curling barrels to brushes. It creates a vortex of air (called the Coanda effect) to draw hair to the wand for effortless drying, smoothing, and curling. Our reviewer loved how it cut down the time she spent on her styling routine. Though the Airwrap is notoriously expensive, this is a legitimate sale, so if you've been on the fence, this might be a good time to try it out.—Brenda Stolyar Tymo Ring Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano likens this trendy 2-in-1 styling tool to a combination hot comb and straightening iron, saying the idea is for users to be able to get closer to their roots without burning themselves than they otherwise would with a classic hot comb. It may not be the best option for those with super-curly hair, as Medea still had to use a flat iron afterward, but people with easier-to-straighten hair who are worried about the potential damage inflicted by traditional flat irons might do well to give this one a try while it’s on sale. Blow-dry brushes have become my holy grail product since becoming the mom of a toddler. Whether my hair was long or short, I found myself grabbing a blow dry brush to help dry my hair and style it enough to resume wrangling my kiddo. My favorite so far is the T3 AireBrush Round, which has a 2.5-inch brush that's small enough for my short hair and can get it dry and styled in a matter of minutes. There are three different heat settings (I like the coolest setting for my fine hair) and two speed settings to use. It's a great brush I find myself grabbing on days I want a blowout. There’s also an oval version that’s on sale too if you prefer the hairbrush shape over the round. —Nena Farrell For those with easy-to-straighten hair who can create sleek styles with just a blow dryer, this budget blow-dry brush is recommended in our Best Hair Straighteners guide as a way to revive second-day hair. It’s a classic round (well, oval in this case) brush with the hair dryer built right in—you can save a step in your blowout process for less than half the price of more popular models. If you’ve been wanting to try a blow-dry brush but aren’t ready to commit to shelling out for one of the trendier, more expensive models, this is the perfect chance to see if it’s the tool for you. On the scale of intimidating hair tools, this one admittedly ranks near the top. Clamping a giant waffle iron-looking contraption close to your scalp? Clips? Mysterious sizzling noises? However, if you want to add first-day volume back into second-, third-, or even fourth-day (don’t judge) hair, this is the way to do it. Though Voloom insists throughout its literature that it’s not a crimping iron, it does work in much the same way, just with a proprietary plate pattern designed to lift your hair off your scalp at the root. I’m honestly not sure how I lived without this thing, but it’s certainly not inexpensive at its full price—if you’ve been wanting to give it a try, today is your chance while it’s still $28 off.

In an interview with The Verge, Sweeney says that reining in Epic’s spending was part of what brought the company to this point. “Last year, before Unreal Fest, we were spending about a billion dollars a year more than we were making,” Sweeney says. “Now, we’re spending a bit more than we’re making.” “The real power will come when we bring these two worlds together” Sweeney says the company is well set up for the future, too, and that it has the ability to make the types of long-term bets he spent the conference describing. “We have a very, very long runway comparing our savings in the bank to our expenditure,” ​​Sweeney says. “We have a very robust amount of funding relative to pretty much any company in the industry and are making forward investments really judiciously that we could throttle up or down as our fortunes change. We feel we’re in a perfect position to execute for the rest of this decade and achieve all of our plans at our size.” Epic has ambitious plans. Right now, Epic offers both Unreal Engine, its high-end game development tools, and Unreal Editor for Fortnite, which is designed to be simpler to use. What it’s building toward is a new version of Unreal Engine that can tie them together. “The real power will come when we bring these two worlds together so we have the entire power of our high-end game engine merged with the ease of use that we put together in [Unreal Editor for Fortnite],” Sweeney says. “That’s going to take several years. And when that process is complete, that will be Unreal Engine 6.” Unreal Engine 6 is meant to let developers “build an app once and then deploy it as a standalone game for any platform,” Sweeney says. Developers will be able to deploy the work that they do into Fortnite or other games that “choose to use this technology base,” which would allow for interoperable content. The upcoming “persistent universe” Epic is building with Disney is an example of the vision. “We announced that we’re working with Disney to build a Disney ecosystem that’s theirs, but it fully interoperates with the Fortnite ecosystem,” Sweeney says. “And what we’re talking about with Unreal Engine 6 is the technology base that’s going to make that possible for everybody. Triple-A game developers to indie game developers to Fortnite creators achieving that same sort of thing.” If you read my colleague Andrew Webster’s interview with Sweeney from March 2023, the idea of interoperability to make the metaverse work will seem familiar. At Unreal Fest this week, I got a better picture of how the mechanics of that might work with things like Unreal Engine 6 and the company’s soon-to-open Fab marketplace to shop for digital assets. Fab will be able to host assets that can work in Minecraft or Roblox, Sweeney says. But the bigger goal is to let Fab creators offer “one logical asset that has different file formats that work in different contexts.” He gave an example of how a user might buy a forest mesh set that has different content optimized for Unreal Engine, Unity, Roblox, and Minecraft. “Having seamless movement of content from place to place is going to be one of the critical things that makes the metaverse work without duplication.” But for an interoperable metaverse to really be possible, companies like Epic, Roblox, and Microsoft will need to find ways for players to move between those worlds instead of keeping them siloed — and for the most part, that isn’t on the horizon. Sweeney says Epic hasn’t had “those sorts of discussions” with anyone but Disney yet. “But we will, over time,” he says. He described an ideal where companies, working as peers, would use revenue sharing as a way to create incentives for item shops that people want to buy digital goods from and “sources of engagement” (like Fortnite experiences) that people want to spend time in. “The whole thesis here is that players are gravitating towards games which they can play together with all their friends, and players are spending more on digital items in games that they trust they’re going to play for a long time,” Sweeney says. “If you’re just dabbling in a game, why would you spend money to buy an item that you’re never going to use again? If we have an interoperable economy, then that will increase player trust that today’s spending on buying digital goods results in things that they’re going to own for a long period of time, and it will work in all the places they go.” “People are not dogmatic about where they play” “There’s no reason why we couldn’t have a federated way to flow between Roblox, Minecraft, and Fortnite,” Epic EVP Saxs Persson says. “From our perspective, that would be amazing, because it keeps people together and lets the best ecosystem win.” Epic sees in its surveys that “people are not dogmatic about where they play,” Persson says. Of course, there’s plenty of opportunity for Epic, which already makes a widely played game and a widely used game engine and is building Fortnite into a game-making tool. (And I haven’t even mentioned how Unreal Engine is increasingly used in filmmaking and other industries.) The end state sounds great for Epic, but Epic also has to make the math make sense for everyone else. And it has to do that without much of a presence on mobile. The company has spent years in legal battles with Apple and Google over their mobile app store practices, and it just sued Samsung, too. The Epic Games Store recently launched on Android globally and on iOS in the EU, but thanks to restrictions on third-party app stores, the company’s game store boss, Steve Allison, tells The Verge that reaching its end-of-year install goal is “likely impossible.” Any major change could take quite a while, according to Sweeney. “It will be a long battle, and it will likely result in a long series of battles, each of which moves a set of freedoms forward, rather than having a single worldwide moment of victory,” Sweeney says. There’s one other battle Epic is fighting: Fortnite is still hugely popular, but there is waning interest — or hype, at least — in the metaverse. Sweeney and Persson, however, don’t exactly agree about the term seemingly falling out of popularity. “It’s like there’s metaverse weather,” Sweeney says. “Some days it’s good, some days it’s bad. Depends on who’s doing the talking about it.”  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly. The Verge is a vox media network © 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Google is rolling out iOS support for its Gmail Q&A feature, which gives users a Gemini-powered AI assistant to help manage their inbox. The Gemini side panel for Gmail was introduced to web and Android devices earlier this year and can potentially provide an easier way to locate specific information that’s buried within emails and Google Drive. Users can ask the Gmail chatbot questions about the contents of their inbox or connected Google Drive, such as finding lost contact information or company data. The Gmail Q&A feature can summarize emails around a particular topic, surface unread messages or emails from a specific sender, and answer general questions from Google search directly within the inbox. Like the web and Android versions, the Gmail Q&A feature on iOS is only available to Google One AI Premium subscribers or Google Workspace accounts with Gemini Business, Enterprise, Education, or Education Premium add-ons. Google says it’s rolling out to those groups now, but it may take a couple of weeks to appear.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

The first cracks are starting to show in Netflix’s push into gaming. First reported in Game File and confirmed by Netflix, the streaming company has quietly closed of one of its studios, the first in the three years since the company began its foray into gaming. According to Game File, the shuttered studio was known as Blue. In 2022, Netflix announced it hired former Overwatch executive producer Chacko Sonny to run the studio. Since then, Blue had brought on a number of game industry veterans with experience working on high profile franchises including Halo and God of War. Reportedly, Blue was developing a multi-platform AAA game for an original IP but was closed before the game could be announced or released. Netflix has released a steady stream of games on its platform since the beginning of its gaming experiment in 2021. Though it started with a small handful of hyper-casual mobile games, Netflix’s offerings have expanded to include mobile exclusive ports of iconic games like Grand Theft Auto and Hades its own internally developed exclusives like Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit and Oxenfree II: Lost Signals. Netflix has also acquired or spun-up a number of studios to support its gaming pipeline. The most recent additions were a mobile game studio in Helsinki, a new studio in southern California, and Cozy Grove developer Spry Fox. But with the closure of Blue, Netflix’s trend of expansion may be over as well as its grander AAA ambitions.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Canva has added a bunch of new AI features to its web-based design platform, including updates for generating text and video effects and a more powerful text-to-image app. The latter is called “Dream Lab” — a new image generator tool born from Canva’s acquisition of generative AI startup Leonardo.ai earlier this year. Dream Lab is powered by Leonardo’s Phoenix model (not be be confused with Adobe’s Firefly AI) and allows users to generate images from descriptions in a variety of styles like “3D render” and “Illustration.”  Canva already has its own Stable Diffusion-based AI image generator and hosts several other third-party apps, but the new Dream Lab offering introduces some improvements to the platform. It’s seemingly better at producing photographic styles and multi-subject images, for example, and includes a feature that can reference an existing image to better control the output — similar to Photoshop’s Reference Image tool. Canva has also made some updates to its wider “Magic” AI tool suit, such as improved accuracy and one-click autocomplete commands for the Magic Write text generation feature. Whiteboards now support AI-powered summarization and real-time reaction stickers for collaborative projects and video editing tools have been added that automatically generate captions and introduce new animation effects. Users can now add interactive charts and graphs to their presentations to help better visualize data. The Canva asset library has also been expanded with new royalty-free music and cinematic videos courtesy of a licensing deal with the Artlist music platform. Canva announced last month that it’s planning to increase its subscription pricing for some business customers to reflect the “expanded product experience” and value that generative AI tools have added to the platform. The Leonardo.AI purchase was likely included in its investment plan, but users may be disappointed that they’re paying increased costs for incremental improvements rather than entirely new generative AI capabilities.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Waymo has its sights set on its next robotaxi: the Hyundai Ioniq 5.  The Alphabet company announced that it was entering a “multi-year, strategic” partnership with the Hyundai Motor Group that will result in the Ioniq 5 eventually joining its robotaxi fleet.  But first, the Ioniq 5 will need to undergo on-road testing with Waymo’s self-driving technology, which the company says will begin in late 2025. Waymo wouldn’t specify when the Ioniq 5 will be used for passenger trips, except to say it would be “years” later. Vehicles intended for Waymo’s fleet will be manufactured at Hyundai’s $7.6 billion Metaplant factory in Georgia, which is nearing the end of its construction. The companies have agreed to produce a number of Waymo-equipped electric Hyundais there “in significant volume over multiple years,” Waymo said in its press release.   Waymo wouldn’t specify when the Ioniq 5 will be used for passenger trips With robotaxis, one of the most important metrics is uptime, or the amount of time it’s on the road ferrying passengers. Time spent plugged into a charger is time not making money. The Ioniq 5 is an electric crossover SUV with a little over 300 miles of range and an 800-volt architecture that enhances its charging speed. When plugged into a 350kW fast charger, Hyundai says the Ioniq 5 can charge from 10–80 percent in just 18 minutes, depending on the conditions. Waymo certainly saw those charging speeds as a benefit to its still unprofitable business.  The Ioniq 5 has received favorable reviews since it was released in late 2021, in addition to raking in numerous awards. Today, it’s one of the bestselling EVs on the market, with 30,000 sold in the US this year alone. Its popularity has helped Hyundai, along with its sister company Kia, overtake Ford and GM as the No. 2 seller of EVs in the US behind Tesla.  Currently, Waymo operates a fleet of hundreds of Jaguar I-Pace vehicles, which has been its primary robotaxi vehicle since the company’s first one, the Chrysler Pacifica minivan, was retired in 2013. The company has plans to add a new vehicle made by Geely’s Zeekr — though the Biden administration’s recent move to quadruple tariffs for electric vehicles imported from China could complicate that.  Recent reporting from South Korea previewed today’s partnership news, with sources telling Electronic Times that the two companies met numerous times at Waymo’s headquarters in California to discuss “contract manufacturing of robotaxis.” Sources also told the publication that Waymo was looking for a “replacement” for its Zeekr vehicles because of costly new tariffs.  But Waymo pushed back against this report and reiterated its intention to eventually deploy Zeekr. “The IONIQ 5 will not directly replace any of our vehicle platforms, but it will help us prepare for additional scale and growth opportunities,” Waymo spokesperson Christopher Bonelli said in an email. Waymo is “hard at work” validating the sixth version of its self-driving technology in the Zeekr vehicle, he added.  Tellingly, Waymo isn’t saying how many Ioniq 5s it plans to buy from Hyundai, in contrast to its approach to previous vehicle announcements. Some of this could be attributable to the fact that Waymo has grown more cautious about overly optimistic predictions after critics panned the AV industry for setting unrealistic deadlines.  This won’t be the Ioniq 5’s first self-driving rodeo. The vehicle also serves as a platform for Motional, which is Hyundai’s robotaxi subsidiary, as well as Avride, which used to be Yandex’s self-driving group.  But Waymo’s business is significantly, well, busier than those firms. The company recently celebrated a significant milestone: 100,000 paid trips a week.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Marriott agreed to pay a $52 million settlement to 49 states and Washington, DC, over a series of data breaches that occurred between 2014 and 2020, affecting more than 334 million customers. As part of a separate agreement, the Federal Trade Commission is also requiring Marriott and its subsidiary, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, to implement an information security program to settle charges over the data breaches.  “Marriott’s poor security practices led to multiple breaches affecting hundreds of millions of customers,” Samuel Levine, the director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement. “The FTC’s action today, in coordination with our state partners, will ensure that Marriott improves its data security practices in hotels around the globe.” The FTC says Marriott and Starwood, which it acquired in 2016, deceived customers by claiming to have reasonable and appropriate data security, but instead left them vulnerable to breaches. The FTC’s complaint alleges that Marriott failed to implement appropriate password controls, firewall controls, or network segmentation. The company failed to patch outdated software and systems and didn’t deploy multifactor authentication, according to the FTC. In one incident, discovered in 2020, hackers stole approximately 20GB of employee and customer data from the BWI Airport Marriott in Baltimore, Maryland. The data included confidential business documents and customer payment information, including credit card authorization forms. As part of the settlement, Marriott has agreed to give all US customers a way to request that any personal information associated with their email addresses or loyalty rewards account numbers be deleted. According to the FTC, customers’ passport information, debit and credit card numbers, dates of birth, email addresses, loyalty numbers, and other information were exposed in the breaches. Marriott is also required to review rewards accounts and restore customers’ stolen rewards points upon request.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

WordPress cofounder Matt Mullenweg and his company Automattic have asked a court to dismiss WP Engine’s lawsuit accusing them of libel and extortion. In a filing on Wednesday, Mullenweg argues that WP Engine is conjuring claims “out of legal thin air,” while alleging it continues to use the WordPress trademark “in unauthorized ways.” Earlier this month, the third-party WordPress hosting service WP Engine filed a lawsuit against Automattic and Mullenweg after the executive embarked on a “scorched earth nuclear” campaign against it. In addition to accusing WP Engine of trademark infringement, Mullenweg claimed the service doesn’t contribute enough to the open-source WordPress.org project, which Mullenweg also controls. WordPress.org also cut off WP Engine’s access to its resources and later took over one of its most popular plugins. As noted in the filing, Mullenweg claims he has “no obligation to provide” WordPress.org’s resources to WP Engine. “The mere fact that WP Engine made the risky decision to base its growing business on a site to which it has no rights or guarantee of access, without making backup plans, is not enough for it to conjure a claim out of legal thin air,” the filing reads.  Mullenweg goes on to claim WP Engine has “chosen without justification to attack Automattic and Matt,” despite allegedly having “no legal (or moral) rights” to WordPress.org’s free services. This very public spat has raised concerns among developers across the WordPress ecosystem who now worry whether they, too, could get cut off from WordPress. But Mullenweg doesn’t seem too worried about the impact. During an interview at TechCrunch’s Disrupt event on Wednesday, Mullenweg said his fight against WP Engine is “obviously” worth the risk. A hearing for WP Engine’s case against WordPress is currently scheduled for next March.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Jay Peters, a news editor who writes about technology, video games, and virtual worlds. He’s submitted several accepted emoji proposals to the Unicode Consortium. Google is building a bunch of AI products, and it’s using AI quite a bit as part of building those products, too. “More than a quarter of all new code at Google is generated by AI, then reviewed and accepted by engineers,” CEO Sundar Pichai said on the company’s third quarter 2024 earnings call. It’s a big milestone that marks just how important AI is to the company. AI is helping Google make money as well. Alphabet reported $88.3 billion in revenue for the quarter, with Google Services (which includes Search) revenue of $76.5 billion, up 13 percent year-over-year, and Google Cloud (which includes its AI infrastructure products for other companies) revenue of $11.4 billion, up 35 percent year-over-year. Operating incomes were also strong. Google Services hit $30.9 billion, up from $23.9 billion last year, and Google Cloud hit $1.95 billion, significantly up from last year’s $270 million. The results indicate that, while many people feel Google isn’t as reliable as it once was, the company continues to operate a very strong business. AI is a huge focus across Google, with the release of features like custom AI chatbots powered by Gemini (called “Gems”), automatic AI note-taking in Google Meet, and a bunch of generative AI tools to help YouTube creators. Google’s well-reviewed Pixel 9 lineup of smartphones were also packed with AI tools. “In Search, our new AI features are expanding what people can search for and how they search for it,” CEO Sundar Pichai says in a statement. “In Cloud, our AI solutions are helping drive deeper product adoption with existing customers, attract new customers and win larger deals. And YouTube’s total ads and subscription revenues surpassed $50 billion over the past four quarters for the first time.” Google is facing a potentially tough road ahead, however, following the August ruling that the company is a monopolist in the search and advertising markets. That case, brought by the US Department of Justice, is now in its remedies phase, and while there’s still a ways to go for the dust to settle, a Google breakup is on the table.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

He’s been a tech journalist for almost 20 years. If you’ve ever experienced the sight and sound of a split-flap display then you’ll immediately understand the nostalgic appeal of Miniot’s pixelated wall clock. Klapklok uses mechanical flaps to convey information, just like the departure boards commonly found in transportation terminals before the arrival of LEDs. As its name suggests, Klapklok primarily functions as a low resolution clock, showing the hour and minute hands using 69 (nice) “paper-like” flaps that act like black and white pixels. But Klapklok also features a Bluetooth app to create pixel drawings if that’s your thing.  As a clock, a selection of the flaps are redrawn every 2.5 minutes with a soothing rustle to show the progression of the hands. At the top of the hour all 69 flaps shuffle at once to display the time in numbers. That makes Klapklock the “gentlest cuckoo clock you’ve ever heard,” according to Miniot. I think the smooth pixel movement looks great, but it really is the sound that sold me when I first saw a working prototype last year. Here, listen for yourself. The USB-C powered clock is a 17.7-inch (45cm) squircle that’s just 0.5 inches (13mm) thick and weighs 3.7 pounds (1.7kg). When the pixels are at rest it’s completely silent, there’s no light, and it uses very little power. It’s expensive because the array of flaps, spools, hinges, magnets, and electronics are all hand assembled in Peter Kolkman’s home workshop — the same place that this small family-run business eventually refined its impressive Wheel record player that plays vinyl vertically. Klapklok will eventually retail for €2,400 (about $2,600). However, it’s temporarily reduced to €1,800 (about $1,950) for the first batch of 25 which are scheduled to ship by December 12th to meet the Christmas deadline.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Adi has covered video games, biohacking, and more for The Verge since 2011.  Hackers released a collection of leaked data from Pokémon game developer Game Freak over the weekend, including personal information about employees. Game Freak — which develops the main lineup of Pokémon video games — confirmed the breach in a statement, saying (per a machine translation from Japanese) that it was the result of “unauthorized access to our servers by a third party” and dated back to August of 2024. Game Freak said the leaked personal information — which it characterizes as names and company email addresses — included around 2,600 items. As Polygon notes, however, the breach appears to include much more than employee information. Redditors and others say they’ve unearthed source code from previous games as well as unused pokémon designs and other things that were scrapped during the development process of those games. They’ve allegedly found more limited detail about future projects, including some codenames for future games. There are no apparent reports of direct leaks from the other companies involved in Pokémon as part of this breach, including Nintendo, Creatures Inc., and the jointly owned Pokémon Company. Game Freak’s statement, which is dated to October 10th but, according to Polygon, appeared on the 13th, says the server has since been secured and that the company is taking steps to bolster its security measures. Here’s the full machine translation: October 10, 2024 Game Freak Inc. Notice and apology regarding the leak of personal information due to unauthorized access Game Freak Inc. (Headquarters: Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, CEO: Satoshi Tajiri, hereinafter referred to as “the Company”) has discovered that the personal information of our employees and others was leaked in connection with unauthorized access to our server by a third party in August 2024. We sincerely apologize for the great inconvenience and concern caused to all concerned parties. 1. Leaked personal information Personal data regarding our employees, etc.* Items: Name, company email address Number of cases: 2,606 *Our employees, contracted business workers (including G-appointed employees and former employees) 2. Response to those whose personal information has been confirmed to have been leaked We are contacting the relevant employees, etc. individually. For those who cannot be contacted individually due to resignation, etc., we will notify them through this announcement and set up a hotline to handle inquiries regarding this matter. 3. Measures to prevent recurrence We have already rebuilt and re-inspected our servers, but we will work to prevent recurrence by further strengthening our security measures. 4. Inquiries regarding this matter Inquiries from those affected by this matter can be made through the hotline below.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

See our ethics statement. Kindles and Kobos are relatively comfortable to use, but if those are too big and restrictive, the smartphone-like Boox Palma is a fantastic alternative that’s grown on us considerably. A new model is on its way, but if you don’t need the smoother performance it promises, you can save a bit on the original today. It’s down to $245.99 ($34 off) at Amazon, which is a new all-time low price. The Boox Palma is a 6.1-inch smartphone size e-reader that’s highly portable. It also runs on Android and comes with the Google Play Store built-in, allowing you to download apps for other digital bookstores, newspapers, note-taking apps, and more.  The Palma’s hardware sheet and appearance resemble a smartphone, but it has neither calling capabilities nor a traditional display. It uses a 6.13-inch backlit E Ink Carta 1200 display instead, offering a crisp 300 ppi resolution. There’s a microphone and speaker, a microSD card slot for expanding its 128GB of internal storage, volume buttons that can double as page-turning buttons, and even a 16-megapixel camera with a flash for scanning documents and handwritten notes. Its pocket-stowable and one-handed form factor makes it more ideal for your everyday carry than a full-sized reader. One big advantage of the Boox Palma compared to most ebook readers is that it runs Android 11 with Google Play, so you can supplement its built-in tools and apps by downloading anything else you like. That means you aren’t locked into any particular ebook ecosystem and don’t have to ditch your favorite sources. Missing your Amazon Kindle library? Just download the Kindle app — a much better proposition than manually sideloading everything. You can also use your preferred music streaming service and news apps. However, the laggy user experience that befalls any E Ink device can be limiting outside of reading and perhaps some casual listening and productivity tasks (and even some New York Times’ crossword puzzles, The Verge’s David Pierce found). It’s fine if you’re just scrolling through pages of your monthly reads, but not ideal for social media deep-diving and other visually rich shenanigans.  The incoming Boox Palma 2 brings a faster octa-core chipset and an Android 13 upgrade (and adds a fingerprint sensor), but no one has tested it yet to find out whether those changes will translate to improved usability in a practical sense. If you’re looking to save a bit and start reading today, you may not miss much by staying a generation behind.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

See our ethics statement. Apple has now revealed the entirety of its M4 Mac lineup. It includes a new entry-level MacBook Pro with M4 for $1,599, as well as the step-up M4 Pro (or M4 Max) models in 14- and 16-inch sizes, which once again start at $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. We’re also getting a new 24-inch iMac with M4, plus an updated Mac Mini with an incredibly small build and an M4 chip. Preorders for the desktop machines start at $1,299 and $599, respectively, and all of the new hardware launches on November 8th. Besides faster processors, a common theme among the 2024 Macs is that they all start with more RAM to aid the Apple Intelligence experience arriving as part of macOS Sequoia 18.1. Apple doubled the memory from 8GB to 16GB on the entry-level M4 MacBook Pro, the M4 iMac, and the M4 Mac Mini. The MacBook Pros with M4 Pro, meanwhile, now offer 18GB as opposed to 24GB. Most of the new machines look familiar otherwise, with the exception of the M4 Mac Mini. The new model is considerably smaller than the M2 Mini from last year, and features a reshuffled I/O configuration — the front has a 3.5mm audio jack and two USB-C / Thunderbolt ports, while the rear gets three additional USB-C ports in addition to a gigabit ethernet and HDMI port. However, the base M4 Mini still uses Thunderbolt 4, while the M4 Pro model gets Thunderbolt 5.  The same Thunderbolt disparity is true between the M4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pros, though all three get upgraded 12-megapixel webcams with support for Apple’s Desk View mode, along with optional nano-texture displays for reducing glare. The iMac looks the same compared to its predecessor, but also gets the 12-megapixel camera bump and a few new colors.  We haven’t tested the new M4 MacBooks, Mac Minis, or iMac (yet), but if you fancy yourself an early adopter, there are a lot of preorder options to consider.  The base M4 MacBook is still only available in a 14-inch configuration, but it now comes with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD at its $1,599 starting price. Apple also threw in an extra USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 port on the right side and added space black as a color option. Apple is accepting preorders right now ahead of the laptop’s November 8th release date. You can upgrade to 1TB of storage for an extra $200 before checkout or 2TB of storage for an additional $400. The same for the RAM; you can get 24GB for another $200 or 32GB for $400. You can also opt for a nano-texture display that reduces screen reflectivity for another $150. The entry-level MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM — double that of its predecessor — for the same starting price of $1,599. It also gets an extra USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 port and comes in a new space black option. You can now preorder the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro (12-core CPU and 16-core GPU), 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage from Apple for $1,999. Stepping up to the 14-core CPU / 20-core GPU version of the M4 Pro chip is an added $200. You can also get a 1TB SSD for $200, 2TB for $600, or 4TB for $1,200. Doubling the RAM to 48GB is another $400.  You can also upgrade the new MacBook Pro to an M4 Max chip. The 14-core CPU / 32-core GPU version is an $800 upgrade and comes with 36GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD to start. You can also preorder a model with a 16-core CPU and 40-core GPU for an extra $1,100. Going with that configuration increases starting RAM to 48GB, plus further upgrade options of 64GB for another $200 or 128GB for an extra $1,000. It’s also the only way to get 8TB of storage, which is an extra $2,200. The 16-inch MacBook Pro is even pricier, naturally. It starts at $2,499 from Apple with a 14-core / 20-core M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD with the same RAM and upgrade options as the 14-inch model. The M4 Max model starts you out with 14 CPU cores, 32 GPU cores, 36GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage for $3,499, with the same SSD upgrades but no option to increase memory. If you want additional RAM, you’ll need the $3,999 model with the 16-core / 40-core M4 Max, which starts with 48GB of RAM and is upgradeable to either 64GB or 128GB. You can get the glare-reducing nano-textured display in both the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro configurations for an extra $150, and both are available in space black and silver.  The 14-inch MacBook Pro with a 12-core / 16-core M4 Pro chip starts with 24GB of RAM — a 6GB increase over the prior generation. It also has a 512GB SSD, three Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports, an optional nano-texture display, and a 12-megapixel webcam. The 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro starts with 24GB of RAM and offers more computing cores (14 for the CPU and 20 for the GPU) compared to the 14-inch model. It also picks up Thunderbolt 5 ports and a new 12-megapixel camera with support for Apple’s Desk View mode. The iMac comes with a Magic Keyboard and your choice of a Magic Mouse or a Magic Trackpad (the latter of which costs $50 extra), all of which now feature USB-C ports. It will be available on November 8th, but you can preorder it now from Apple in green, yellow, orange, pink, purple, blue, and silver, with the base model starting at $1,299. It’s also up for preorder in select configurations at Amazon for the same price or at Best Buy for $50 off with a My Best Buy Plus or Total membership, which start at $50 a year. The entry-level version offers a pair of Thunderbolt / USB 4 ports, along with an 8-core CPU and an 8-core GPU. It also offers 16GB of RAM, but you can upgrade to 24GB for $200 more. The iMac also features 256GB of storage by default, but an extra $200 gets you 512GB of storage, while $400 more gets you 1TB of storage. For another $200, you can add nano-textured glass, which helps scatter light and minimize screen glare. The higher-end models, meanwhile, are available from Apple, Amazon, and Best Buy starting at $1,499 and come with four Thunderbolt 4 ports, 16GB RAM, and 256GB of storage. Paying $200 extra allows you to upgrade to either 24GB of RAM or 512GB of storage. If you need even more storage, you can get 1TB or 2TB for an extra $400 or $800, respectively. Apple also lets you upgrade to 32GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $400 extra. The latest version of Apple’s all-in-one desktop computer features an M4 chip and support for Apple Intelligence. Unlike its predecessor, the base model now offers 16GB RAM by default, along with a new 12MP webcam. The M4 Mac Mini is currently available from Apple, Amazon, and Best Buy starting at $599 in its base configuration, which includes a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. You can upgrade to 512GB of storage for an additional $200, 1TB for $400, or 2TB for $800. RAM surcharges are similar; jumping to 24GB of RAM adds another $200 to your total, and you can get it with up to 32GB of RAM for $400.  As for the model with the M4 Pro chip, you can preorder it from Apple, Amazon, and Best Buy starting at $1,399 with a 12-core CPU and a 16-core GPU, 24GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. Upgrading the M4 Pro to a 14-core CPU and 20-core GPU costs an extra $200. You can also double the storage to 1TB for $200, get 2TB for $600, 4TB for $1,200, or max out with 8TB for $2,400. Memory upgrades are similarly pricey, with 48GB adding $400 to the total and 64GB adding $600. Both the M4 and M4 Pro Mac Minis allow you to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for an extra $100, too. There’s only one color (silver), by the way, and neither package includes a mice or keyboard. Both will start shipping on November 8th. The latest Mac Mini features Apple’s upgraded M4 chips and a smaller build than the prior model. Each configuration now starts with 16GB of RAM and includes five total Thunderbolt ports, gigabit ethernet, HDMI, and a 3.5mm jack. Update, October 30th: Added preorder details regarding Apple’s new M4 MacBook Pro models. We also added new retailer links for the M4 Mac Mini.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

This week, DirecTV announced it intends to buy Dish, Sling TV, and the rest of EchoStar’s television business for a dollar (while also taking on all of Dish’s debt), combining almost 20 million satellite TV subscribers from two companies that have been circling one another for decades. But it’s not just DirecTV and Dish. AT&T, Comcast, Verizon, General Electric, GM, News Corp, Tumblr, and the various incarnations of Time Warner have also gotten mixed up or split up while trying to bridge the gap between communications and media over the years. Here’s a partial timeline of the events that might end with these two companies joining together at last. At the turn of the 21st century, it was obvious that the internet was the future. Instant communication between anyone in the world and the idea of digital distribution was irresistible, and AOL seemed on top of the world.  What better way for Time Warner to get in on the ground floor than to join forces with the company that rode to the top, one 60-hours-of-free-internet CD at a time? By 2009, it was all over. Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T’s acquisitions were an attempt to take over the media landscape built on their networks, with varying degrees of success, delivering brands like Oath, WarnerMedia, and Peacock as well as the entirely forgettable Go90. Over the next few years, AT&T executives float bad ideas for Game of Thrones, like shooting “snackable” vertical video versions. The company eventually introduced HBO Max before demoting HBO from its streaming brand, renaming the service Max. You know what happened next: Netflix never looked back on its path to 270 million global subscribers, and Disney reintroduced the bundle for streaming. At the same time, both Quibi and CNN Plus evaporated too quickly to make an impact. Ultimately, Verizon sold what was left of Oath to Apollo Global Management, and then AT&T shipped WarnerMedia off into a partnership with Discovery. Now, AT&T is selling all of DirecTV to TPG. That’s the private equity firm behind this new $1 attempt to merge with Dish Network again, while EchoStar can continue on its quest to build a nationwide Open RAN 5G network.  We’ll see everyone back here in another 20 years to find out how it all worked out, okay?

            "content": "By  Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled a new electric vehicle dedicated to self-driving, a possible milestone after years of false promises and blown deadlines.  The robotaxi is a purpose-built autonomous vehicle, lacking a steering wheel or pedals, meaning it will need approval from regulators before going into production. The design was futuristic, with doors that open upward like butterfly wings and a small cabin with only enough space for two passengers. There was no steering wheel or pedals, nor was there a plug — Musk said the vehicle charges inductively to regain power wirelessly.  Musk said that autonomous cars are expected to be 10-20 times safer than human-driven vehicles Musk said that autonomous cars are expected to be 10–20 times safer than human-driven vehicles and could cost as little as 20 cents per mile, compared to the $1 per mile for city buses.  Tesla plans to launch fully autonomous driving in Texas and California next year, with the Cybercab entering production by 2026 — although he said it could be as late as 2027. Additionally, Tesla is developing the Optimus robot, which could be available for $20,000–$30,000 and is capable of performing various tasks. “This is a very big deal,” Musk said. “It’ll save lives, a lot of lives, and prevent injuries.” Musk revealed the prototype robotaxi at Tesla’s “We, Robot” event held at the Warner Bros. film lot in Burbank, California, with a lot of nonpublic roads for the demonstration. Tesla has reportedly been mapping the area in advance of the demonstration, even though the company says it doesn’t rely on high-definition maps to power its Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver-assist feature.   Musk is attempting to steer Tesla away from its core business of making and selling EVs toward one that produces robots and AI. Tesla’s market cap is equal to almost all the other global automaker’s values combined. Much of the company’s stock price is based on Musk’s yearslong promise to solve autonomy by releasing a truly revolutionary vehicle that can drive itself anywhere it wants.  Whether Tesla’s robotaxi will accomplish that steep task is anyone’s guess. Musk has a reputation for defying the odds, but AV experts have routinely questioned Tesla’s approach to the technology, especially with regard to the company’s aggressive push for Level 2 advanced driver-assist systems like Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (Supervised).  1/11 1/11 Those features, which are not autonomous and require a driver to stay vigilant at all times, can be impressive but have also been known to make critical errors. Earlier this year, a 28-year-old motorcyclist was killed by a Tesla driver allegedly using FSD. Tesla has been forced to recall both of its driver-assist systems in the face of increased government scrutiny over the company’s autonomy claims. But Musk has a track record of coming from behind to pull off impossible victories. The Model 3 production and the early success of the Cybertruck are two recent examples of Musk defying expectations.  “Think about the cumulative time that people spend in a car” During the event, Musk pitched the idea of autonomous cars primarily as time-savers. “Think about the cumulative time that people spend in a car,” he said, “and the time they will get back that they can now spend on their books or watching a movie or doing work or whatever.” Still, Tesla is lagging behind companies like Waymo and Cruise, both of which have racked up millions of miles of on-road testing with their driverless vehicles. To be sure, robotaxis have had a bumpy rollout, with numerous incidents of blocked vehicles, traffic jams, and even a handful of injuries. Federal safety regulators are probing several major players to discern whether the technology powering these vehicles is safe or should be recalled.  The families of Tesla drivers who have been killed in crashes involving Autopilot have sued the company for wrongful death. And Musk’s tenure as head of X, formerly Twitter, has alienated many of Tesla’s progressive-leaning customers, who have watched in horror as he promotes right-wing conspiracy theories on the platform.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Ford is idling the factory where it makes its F-150 Lightning electric pickup trucks until next year, the company said today. It’s another unwelcome hiccup in Ford’s path to becoming a global EV producer.  The plan is to shut things down after the last shift on Friday, November 15th, at which point the plant will be closed for seven weeks, including holidays in which no work would have occurred anyway. The reasons are a bit vague, with Ford spokesperson Emma Berg citing a need to “adjust production for an optimal mix of sales growth and profitability.” That last word — profitability — is surely driving most of this decision. While Tesla just had a  better-than-expected earnings quarter, Ford is still struggling to squeeze profit out of its Model e division, which covers EVs, software, and more.  The plan is to shut things down after the last shift on Friday, November 15th The company reported losing $1.2 billion during the third quarter of this year on Model e, and projects that it will lose $5 billion on its EV business for the whole year. The company cited “industrywide pricing pressure” as among the reasons for the losses.  When it first came out, the F-150 Lightning was held up as enormously important for Ford’s long-term growth and vision. An electrified version of the world’s most popular pickup truck, and America’s most popular vehicle? Obviously Ford was going to print money on this model.  But the Lightning has had a rocky start. Prices have been slashed, production paused and restarted, and dealership inventory has remained a sticking point. The Tesla Cybertruck, that low poly lightning rod of praise and ridicule, recently outpaced the F-150 Lightning (and truly every electric truck on the market) in sales.  The last time Ford idled the plant was to increase its size to expand production. The company anticipated making 70,000 trucks a year in the newly enlarged factory. As of this most recent quarter, Ford has delivered 22,807 Lightnings.  The company is likely to keep running into these challenges as it scrambles to develop a next-generation EV platform to that is more low-cost than its current one. Ford has a “skunkworks” team in Silicon Valley developing this new platform right now. But in the meantime, it needs to sell more F-150 Lightnings.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Sean Hollister, a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget. DJI, the world’s largest drone company, is suing to avoid being seen as a tool of the Chinese government. On Friday, it sued the US Department of Defense to delete its name from a list of “Chinese Military Companies,” claiming it has no such relationship to Chinese authorities and has suffered unfairly as a result of that designation. Since DJI was added to that list in 2022, the company claims, it has “lost business deals, been stigmatized as a national security threat, and been banned from contracting with multiple federal government agencies,” and that its employees “now suffer frequent and pervasive stigmatization” and are “repeatedly harassed and insulted in public places.” It also alleges that the DoD would not offer the company any explanation for its designation as a “Chinese Military Company” until DJI threatened a lawsuit this September, and claims that when the DoD finally offered up its reasoning, it was filled with errors.  “The Department of Defense does not provide information or statements regarding any pending litigation matters,\" DoD spokesperson Maj. Selena Rodts tells The Verge.  You can read DJI’s full argument that it’s not owned or controlled by the Chinese military in the complaint below: Regardless of whether the DoD has enough evidence to label DJI this way, it’s far from the only US government entity that’s been inclined to restrict and scrutinize the company over possible ties to the Chinese government. The US Army asked units to stop using DJI drones as early as 2017.  In 2019, the US Interior Department grounded its fleet of DJI drones over spying risks. In 2020, the US Department of Commerce added DJI to its Entity List, banning US companies from exporting technology to DJI after it “enabled wide-scale human rights abuses within China through abusive genetic collection and analysis or high-technology surveillance.” In 2021, the US Treasury added DJI to its list of Non-SDN Chinese Military Industrial Complex Companies, writing that it had provided drones to the Chinese government so it could conduct surveillance of Uyghurs, and suggesting that DJI was complicit in serious human rights abuse as a result.  Some US government entities were restricted from buying new DJI drones following these various actions. And this past week, DJI reported that some of its drones have been blocked by US customs using the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act as justification. In its defense, DJI has repeatedly claimed it isn’t owned or controlled by the Chinese government, that it’s had “nothing to do with treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang,” that it’s simply selling drones that may be used for various purposes that are out of its control afterwards, that many of those purposes have helped entities (including first responders) in the United States, and that independent audits by consulting firms and US government agencies (including the DoD) have found no security threats. While DJI does admit in the complaint that two Chinese state-owned investment funds did make minority investments in the company, it claims the Shanghai Free Trade Zone Equity Fund has “less than 1% of DJI’s shares and less than 0.1% of DJI’s voting rights,” and that the Chengtong Fund ended its investment in June 2023.  (DJI says just four people control 99 percent of DJI and own 87 percent of its shares — DJI founder and early employees Frank Wang, Henry Lu, Swift Xie, and Li Zexiang.) Congress is currently considering a complete import ban of new DJI drones and other equipment in the United States by suggesting they pose a national security risk — though that ban is currently on ice. While the House of Representatives did approve it after it was tacked onto the must-pass National Defense Authorization Act, the Senate’s version of the bill doesn’t currently contain the ban (though it might still add it back). But until the US customs hold-up, which DJI is suggesting is just a misunderstanding, the US government hadn’t taken any actions that would keep stores from importing drones, consumers from buying them, or individual pilots from flying them in the United States. Even should Congress ban new DJI drones from being sold, the proposed text of those bills suggests existing owners could keep flying the ones they own.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

See our ethics statement. We’re well past the Prime Day Redux now, but several standout deals from the sale are still hanging on. In fact, some are even better than they were during the two-day sale — even if only a smidge. The Beats Pill portable Bluetooth speaker in red is down to $97.99 ($52 off) at Amazon, for example, which is $1 cheaper than the all-time low we saw it hit this past week. It’s also still available for $99.99 ($50 off) in gold and black. The pill-shaped speaker represents a roaring comeback for the brand in the category. It’s the first new Beats-branded portable speaker we’ve seen in years after the Pill Plus was discontinued in 2022. Apple refined the original’s charming design and revamped its entire feature set with welcome modernities like two-way USB-C charging and lossless audio. We also get native support for some iOS and Android tie-ins, including each platform’s respective Find My feature and access to Siri and Google Assistant (sadly, you can’t summon either by voice). We found it sounds pretty good, too. Apple claims its redesigned woofer and repositioned tweeter handle distortion better, and it does sound good for its size, though we noticed its limitations as a mono speaker at the volume’s high end. You can pair two of them for true stereo sound, however, and it’s otherwise great for most listening scenarios. The speaker also has IP67 water and dust protection, up to 24 hours of battery life, and a built-in lanyard for easy transport.  The 2024 Beats Pill offers improved sound, USB-C, and native support for Find My and voice assistants on both iOS and Android. It also bests the previous model with double the battery life (24 hours) and IP67 water resistance.

See our ethics statement. The Pixel Watch 3 may be the shining refinement Google’s wearable lineup needed, but the last-gen Pixel Watch 2 is still a great buy. That’s especially true when you can get it for as low as $224 ($26 off) — which is the watch’s current starting price at both Amazon and Best Buy. Although the Pixel Watch 3 introduces a host of solid improvements — including a bigger and brighter display, a new 44mm size, AI-generated workout suggestions, and offline Google Maps — the second-gen Pixel Watch is still a looker. It only comes in one size (41mm), and the usable display area is only about 10 percent smaller than the third-gen model. It also uses the same Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear W5 Gen 1 chip, though it lacks the ultra wideband chip that lets you unlock nearby Pixel devices and select BMW vehicles. Overall, performance between the two is similar and battery life on the 41mm models is about the same, averaging about 24 hours per charge. With the Watch 2, you’re only really missing out on the new workout features (other once-exclusive Wear OS 5 features have started to trickle down to the Watch 2), plus a screen that’s said to be twice as bright. If you don’t feel those Watch 3 traits are worth the $350 starting price, we’d still happily recommend picking up the older model. The Pixel Watch 2 lasts a reliable 24 hours on a single charge with the always-on display enabled. It offers the same Qualcomm processor as the new Pixel Watch 3, along with a multipath health sensor, Wear OS 5 compatibility, and a host of welcome safety features.

            "content": "AA  lot has been said about TV in 2004. That it was the best year of television of all time, the peak of the Golden Age of television. Or maybe that it was the year reality television became too much, suddenly showing up on every channel as we flipped the switch. But as famed Hollywood producer and UFO enthusiast Bryce Zabel wrote for the Los Angeles Times in 2004, it was the end of television as we knew it. He chalked it up to the prevalence of TiVo and DVR in American households and predicted an upheaval so severe the whole advertising business would crumble — and he didn’t even know about streaming yet. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe shift was one that a lot of people felt in real time. For many, it was through the show Lost, which debuted in 2004 and created a fervor among obsessives trying to understand the show’s central mysteries. For me, it was a smaller but equally influential show: Veronica Mars.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn true early aughts fashion, for me, it was an AIM away message that started it all: “BRB Watching Veronica Mars.” It was the days before one could text or doomscroll while watching TV, and setting a solid away message while you stepped away from the family computer to watch a show was key. Earlier that day, in school, my friends and I had been discussing the previous episode in anticipation like we did every week, dissecting the storylines and proposing our own theories of who-done-it (no spoilers here — if you haven’t seen it, watch it!). I came back to the computer during one of the commercial breaks, and there was a message from my friend with a link to Television Without Pity’s latest Veronica Mars recap, with the caption “DID YOU SEE THIS?” In that particular recap, the author Couch Baron had made the same joke I made to her earlier that day almost word by word. I clicked.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recap was long, thorough, and meant to catch TiVo-less fans up on what they missed the previous week. Reading through it, though, I felt like the writer was one of my friends who I discussed the show with, only he was funnier than us and could go on for pages and pages offering context, theories, and Easter eggs we would never think of. I was hooked. Not only did I have to watch Veronica every Wednesday night at 9PM — my parents did not splurge on TiVo — but I had to read Couch Baron’s recap as soon as it went live. The TWoP recaps opened a window to a community I didn’t know existed. A world of comment sections and forums, fan theories, ships (before they were called ships), music credits (I see you, Tegan and Sara), and production gossip. Like Veronica Mars herself, people on the internet were sleuths, collectively investigating and chipping into answers to the show’s biggest questions and mysteries.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd TWoP also recaps for basically all other shows on TV. The biggest was Lost, an instant network hit that had its own dedicated crop of TWoP recaps and forum threads discussing the Smoke Monster, the meaning of “see you in another life, brother,” and other oddly specific breadcrumbs that the show’s creators had left for its rabid fan base. It was thanks to the internet that I learned that “Make Your Own Kind of Music” was a ’60s hit song by Cass Elliot so I could illegally download it on Kazaa.

For many, it was through the show Lost, which debuted in 2004 and created a fervor among obsessives trying to understand the show’s central mysteries. For me, it was a smaller but equally influential show: Veronica Mars.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn true early aughts fashion, for me, it was an AIM away message that started it all: “BRB Watching Veronica Mars.” It was the days before one could text or doomscroll while watching TV, and setting a solid away message while you stepped away from the family computer to watch a show was key. Earlier that day, in school, my friends and I had been discussing the previous episode in anticipation like we did every week, dissecting the storylines and proposing our own theories of who-done-it (no spoilers here — if you haven’t seen it, watch it!). I came back to the computer during one of the commercial breaks, and there was a message from my friend with a link to Television Without Pity’s latest Veronica Mars recap, with the caption “DID YOU SEE THIS?” In that particular recap, the author Couch Baron had made the same joke I made to her earlier that day almost word by word. I clicked.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe recap was long, thorough, and meant to catch TiVo-less fans up on what they missed the previous week. Reading through it, though, I felt like the writer was one of my friends who I discussed the show with, only he was funnier than us and could go on for pages and pages offering context, theories, and Easter eggs we would never think of. I was hooked. Not only did I have to watch Veronica every Wednesday night at 9PM — my parents did not splurge on TiVo — but I had to read Couch Baron’s recap as soon as it went live. The TWoP recaps opened a window to a community I didn’t know existed. A world of comment sections and forums, fan theories, ships (before they were called ships), music credits (I see you, Tegan and Sara), and production gossip. Like Veronica Mars herself, people on the internet were sleuths, collectively investigating and chipping into answers to the show’s biggest questions and mysteries.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd TWoP also recaps for basically all other shows on TV. The biggest was Lost, an instant network hit that had its own dedicated crop of TWoP recaps and forum threads discussing the Smoke Monster, the meaning of “see you in another life, brother,” and other oddly specific breadcrumbs that the show’s creators had left for its rabid fan base. It was thanks to the internet that I learned that “Make Your Own Kind of Music” was a ’60s hit song by Cass Elliot so I could illegally download it on Kazaa.

            "content": "By  Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Has there ever been a presidential election so totally obsessed with the American auto industry?  Sure, past campaigns have made glancing reference to the storied auto sector, mostly as a stand-in for popular tropes like American ingenuity and hard work. But this election feels different. The combination of Michigan, the home of the Big Three automakers (Ford, GM, and Stellantis), as a crucial swing state and the historic shift toward electric vehicles, has put the industry in the red-hot center of an already unpredictable presidential race.   Joe Biden kicked things off early on by making EVs the centerpiece of his administration’s efforts to fight climate change. That included billions of dollars for new charging infrastructure, tax credits for buyers, and billions more for manufacturers looking to build new factories (or retrofit old ones). The president, a self-professed car guy, even got behind the wheel of an electric Ford truck to demonstrate his commitment to these cleaner, less-polluting vehicles. (“That sucker,” the president declared, “is quick.”)  Naturally, this all got distilled and distorted through the right-wing media woodchipper as a government mandate to purchase electric vehicles and a ban on our beloved gas cars. Former President Donald Trump and the Republican apparatus seized on what they saw as trepidation among consumers about EV range and high prices and turned that into a message of government overreach. After all, EVs could be cold and digital, while the pistons firing under the hoods of gas cars had all the patriotic fervor of a firework display.  Trump spent most of the year ridiculing EVs on the campaign trail, claiming they would “kill” the American auto industry and “assassinate” jobs. The United Auto Workers strike over the summer added fuel to the fire, with many workers expressing unease about the shift. Trump declared that the Biden administration “ordered a hit job on Michigan manufacturing” by encouraging the sale of electric cars. (Language that now seems weirdly prescient given the multiple recent attempts on his life.) And he’s promised to reverse Biden’s policies on “day one” if elected in November.  To be sure, the Democrats’ plan was a familiar neoliberal mash-up of tax credits and abatements aimed at getting people who are already well off to spend a little more on an expensive EV in the hopes that sales volume would eventually help cool prices. Republicans could have had a reasonable counter message about excessive spending to help the rich better afford cool cars but instead ended up settling on Trump’s fever dream distortions.  The swift politicization of EVs took many by surprise The swift politicization of EVs took many by surprise, including the people in charge of making them: “I never thought the propulsion system on a vehicle would be [political],” General Motors CEO Mary Barra recently told CBS News Sunday Morning. Ford CEO Jim Farley penned a LinkedIn post about how much he loves EVs and his belief that they should have “nothing to do with politics.”  Of course, it’s naive to think that anything that happens in America in the 21st century can be completely divorced from politics. The type of car you buy has always been a signifier of certain core beliefs. Pickup trucks are Republican-coded, much in the same way the Toyota Prius is often associated with coastal liberals.  Politics has always been ingrained in the car business. The federal government regulates safety, while drivers are licensed by states. But more than that, the government uses its policy-making powers to steer consumers to certain desired outcomes, just as regulations force manufacturers to adopt preferred technologies. And these policies originate from certain beliefs, such as the certainty that climate change is a very real threat and tailpipe pollution is a major contributor. Earlier this year, the Environmental Protection Agency adopted new rules aimed at slashing greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2032. EVs would need to account for over half of new vehicle sales for automakers to meet these strict mandates. Trump claims to believe that people should have the freedom to drive whatever car they want, regardless of the environmental impact. To him, rising sea levels imply more desirable “oceanfront property.” But beliefs are malleable, and politics is fickle. Tesla owners who thought they were making an environmentally conscious choice are now stuck driving totems to Elon Musk’s quixotic turn to the right. And the Tesla CEO’s slavish support for Trump has helped to soften the former president’s stance on EVs. No longer are they stealthy job assassins — now, Trump lauds them as “incredible,” if not for everyone.  The Tesla CEO’s slavish support for Trump has helped to soften the former president’s stance on EVs Polls show that support for EVs splits along party lines. Democrats continue to funnel billions into EV infrastructure, even as sales growth slows and manufacturers suddenly balk at the aggressive stance they themselves took when EVs seemed poised to take over the world. Plug-in hybrids are now the new fad. Trump says that, if elected, no state would be allowed to ban internal combustion engines.  Out on the campaign trail, Vice President Kamala Harris has kept EVs — and indeed the entire Biden climate legacy — at an arm’s length, instead talking about her support for fracking as she attempts to court the must-win state of Pennsylvania. Her shift to the center has left EVs in a bit of a chilly spot.  Harris has been tough to pin down on EVs. She knows that Biden’s embrace didn’t quite pay off for him politically. EVs poll poorly in battleground states, including Michigan. And now that Trump has Musk giddily hopping around onstage for him like a marionette, Trump’s free to ramp up his attacks, pouring money into ads that falsely claim that Harris wants to “end all gas cars.” After weeks of dodging the issue, Harris addressed it head-on in a speech in Flint, Michigan: “Let us be clear,” she said, “contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive.”  Only 3 in 10 Americans said they would consider an EV for their next purchase, and support is dropping, according to the Pew Research Center. Pew cites a familiar set of concerns around charging, range anxiety, and prices. Another recent study says the number of Americans that actually believe EVs are better for the planet than gas-powered cars is also dropping. The US has spent billions of dollars to push EVs, and the needle is barely moving. In May 2024, EVs represented 6.8 percent of overall car sales in the US, down from 8.8 percent of total sales in 2023.   With growth flatlining, Biden’s emphasis on EVs as the key weapon against climate change is looking misplaced, especially when compared to the multi-decade investments that paved the way for China to claim the EV crown. China has cracked the code on cheap EVs, with several models selling for $20,000 or less.  The only country producing EVs is our enemy in a new cold war In the US, the average EV transaction is still north of $50,000. If Chinese EV makers like Geely and BYD are allowed to sell them in the US, industry soothsayers warn it could usher in the end of the Big Three. It’s a paradox: we need EVs to reduce emissions, and they need to be cheap so people can buy them, but the only country producing them is our enemy in a new cold war.  Neither Harris nor Trump seems to have much in the way of solutions to China except more tariffs and more protectionist trade policies. Americans need cheap EVs, and China has plenty to sell. But if there’s anything that Trump, Biden, and Harris can all agree on, it’s that you will never be allowed to buy one.  Weirdly, EVs have sucked up so much airtime, we really have no clue about either candidate’s position on the rest of transportation. If you search their policy platforms online, you won’t find any mention of important issues like infrastructure, aviation, public transit, or urban planning.  But since the past is prologue, we can make some educated guesses. Harris likely supports the Biden administration’s efforts to clean up the transportation network by investing in electrification, while also focusing on walkable cities and environmental justice initiatives. Meanwhile, Trump seems poised to eliminate funding for public transportation and would continue funding highway expansion projects, as outlined in the notorious Project 2025 document. But until we know the result of the election, we won’t know for sure.  What seems certain, though, is that whoever wins will have a huge impact on the next car you buy.    / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Elizabeth Lopatto, a reporter who writes about tech, money, and human behavior. She joined The Verge in 2014 as science editor. Previously, she was a reporter at Bloomberg.  It is my personal belief that no normal person should know the name of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s chair, and yet here I am, about to explain why he’s been an issue in the 2024 presidential election. The man in question is Gary Gensler, an economist who formerly worked at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As SEC chair, he has been on the receiving end of death threats. Former President and current Republican nominee Donald Trump made a campaign promise to “fire Gary Gensler” to the raucous approval of a packed arena at this year’s Bitcoin Conference. Though blockchain enthusiasts have been the most vocal in their displeasure, the controversy around Gensler isn’t limited to them. The Economist has dubbed Gensler “the most controversial man in American finance”; House Democrats and Republicans have expressed “stern displeasure” on Gensler’s crypto approach. You could say he is unpopular. Many industries dislike their regulators. It is arguably the job of the SEC commissioner to be somewhat unpopular! And the cryptocurrency industry’s revulsion for Gensler is unsurprising after a series of SEC enforcements, including against major companies and exchanges. But Gensler himself became a contentious, oddly partisan issue on the level of presidential politics. And the story gets more complicated from there because this is not a cut-and-dried case of a regulator being persecuted by the industry for doing his job. Gensler is also unpopular among his own staff, though not for any reasons that will get thousands of people roaring inside a convention center.  It’s unusual for the SEC to be a hot-button issue — even during the 2008 financial crisis, the SEC chair wasn’t exactly a well-known figure. (The chair at the time was Christopher Cox. Yes, literally who.) But the SEC has become politically heated because Gensler wanted it to be, says Adam Pritchard, a professor of securities law at the University of Michigan. “He wanted to raise the profile of the agency,” says Pritchard, pointing to what he says is “an ambitious rulemaking agenda.” Let’s review some very recent history: Gensler’s time at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the agency that regulates derivatives markets. Gensler was in charge of the CFTC in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, during which he successfully convinced Congress to include, as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, new rules involving swaps (a type of financial derivative that was implicated in the crisis) that put them under the purview of the CFTC. His approach at that agency was described using words such as “hard-charging” and “aggressive.”  Before Dodd-Frank, the CFTC’s oversight was just the $35 trillion futures market; after, it was responsible for the $400 trillion swaps market as well. But taking on new duties also meant a lot of new work. The CFTC had to write a lot of new rules, and real people had to clock in hours to make that happen. On top of that, his enforcement chief filed “a record number of cases” against Wall Street banks. As a result of the speed and confusion with which the CFTC was working, the staff had to issue “130 exemptions or no-action letters,” essentially saying no enforcement action should be taken despite the existence of a new rule. He built up a reputation as a micromanager Under Gensler’s leadership, the CFTC outspent its budget and sometimes had to put employees on unpaid leave. At the same time, he built up a reputation as a micromanager. Gensler “routinely demanded that staff work weekends and holidays,” according to the Partnership for Public Service, which named the CFTC as one of the worst places in government to work while Gensler was at the helm.  Gensler’s management style left much to be desired; it also left the CFTC with a considerable amount of unoccupied real estate. Office space at the CFTC surged by almost 75 percent during his tenure. “Gensler signed leases across the country, assuming he would be able to fill the offices with new staff,” noted Fortune. But the funding for that staff never came, and by 2016, a fifth of the agency’s headquarters in DC remained unoccupied — as did almost a third of the New York office.  The playbook Gensler has been using at the SEC looks similar. Here, too, he’s been known for his hard-driving ethos. His two highest-profile issues, environmental disclosures and crypto, have earned him enemies in the Republican Party.  Under the SEC’s new rules around environmental disclosures, companies are required to disclose risks related to climate change. (Those rules have been paused in the face of an onslaught of lawsuits — part of a larger-scale attack on the regulatory state via the courts.)  “I don’t imagine a lot of voters are up in arms about public companies being forced to disclose the impact their policies have on the environment,” says Marc Fagel, who spent more than a decade at the SEC and who is now a lecturer at Stanford Law School. But because Republicans have been complaining about “ESG,” and “woke Wall Street,” this otherwise anodyne set of rules is now part of the culture wars.   But it’s Gensler’s record on crypto that makes his haters really froth at the mouth.  The division between the CFTC and the SEC is peculiar; in most other countries, there’s just one financial regulator. That division is a crucial part of the crypto story; the industry’s preferred regulator is the CFTC. But in the absence of a congressional mandate, a turf war has ensued, with the SEC filing enforcement actions against Coinbase and Binance, two of the largest exchanges, in 2023, claiming the exchanges allowed users to trade unregistered securities.  The SEC under both Gensler and his predecessor had some significant wins; it litigated or settled almost 200 crypto cases since 2017, Gensler told Barron’s in May. In March, a judge found that the suit against Coinbase could go forward — saying the SEC had sufficiently shown “that Coinbase operates as an exchange, as a broker, and as a clearing agency under the federal securities laws, and, through its Staking Program, engages in the unregistered offer and sale of securities.” Gensler has said outright that crypto is “rife with fraud, scams, bankruptcies and money laundering” Meanwhile, Gensler has said outright that crypto is “rife with fraud, scams, bankruptcies and money laundering” — not in and of itself a controversial opinion but one that maybe comes off a touch more outspoken than the typical federal bureaucrat. Maybe to drive the point home, he’s taken a number of crypto companies to task with enforcement actions, which include but are not limited to lawsuits. This is a sore point for the crypto industry, which has complained that the SEC isn’t making rules, just punishing companies, and doing so without providing clear guidance about how to avoid punishment. When the crypto exchange Coinbase requested that the SEC draft comprehensive rules for the crypto industry, the SEC rejected its petition. Coinbase then filed a legal challenge, saying the SEC’s denial was “arbitrary and capricious,” one of the legal standards for overturning an agency action.  Before I say more, let’s go over that again: one of the biggest crypto exchanges asked for more regulation, and then the regulatory agency in question — run by a man who says crypto is full of scams and frauds — said no. That seems pretty absurd on the face of it. Keep in mind, however, that there’s some weird legal crossfire in the timeline. Coinbase’s suit against the SEC over rulemaking was happening at the same time as the SEC’s suit against Coinbase over unregistered securities. And on top of that, there’s an additional complication: regulation just isn’t what it used to be. “The conservative judiciary has limited rulemaking,” says Fagel, the former SEC staffer. (The Supreme Court kneecapped regulators earlier this summer as part of an ongoing trend toward disempowering federal agencies.) “Yes, the SEC could spend three years concocting an entire regulatory regime for crypto. There would be a lawsuit in an hour.”  “Yes, the SEC could spend three years concocting an entire regulatory regime for crypto. There would be a lawsuit in an hour.” It might be more realistic to think of Coinbase’s suit as not asking for regulation per se, but as asking for regulation that Coinbase likes. Because if Coinbase doesn’t like said regulation, it’ll sue. Meanwhile, the courts have tended to back the SEC when it sues or takes enforcement actions — as opposed to rulemaking or other agency decision-making — so, rationally speaking, it’s just good sense for the SEC to focus on doing the things that judges let them do.  Gensler’s approach would be defensible, except that the SEC hasn’t abandoned rulemaking. In just the first eight months of 2022, the SEC proposed more than twice as many new rules as in 2021, and more than had been proposed annually for the last five years, according to an SEC inspector general report.  “There’s no question that the rulemaking initiatives have come fast and furious since he took over at the SEC,” says Pritchard. That means that the number of challenges to the rules has also spiked. Crafting rules that will withstand challenges is time-intensive, creating a feedback loop of more work for the staff, Pritchard says. This is the part that makes Gensler’s SEC start to look a lot like Gensler’s CFTC, and not in a good way. As a result of the pace of rulemaking, attrition rates at the SEC were the highest in 10 years, the 2022 inspector general report said. Managers told the SEC inspector general that it had been harder to hire people with experience, so the agency was relying on temporary workers, “in some cases with little or no experience in rulemaking.”  According to the SEC union, staff have been leaving “at more than twice the rate prior to Gensler’s arrival, and the pace of departures is continuing to accelerate.” The people who were most likely to leave were the most experienced. The SEC staff has experienced benefit cuts, which the union chalks up to “a series of budget decisions made by Chair Gensler,” who chose to increase spending, betting that Congress would increase the SEC’s budget. “In effect, Chair Gensler wagered with your compensation and benefits, knowing that his staff would suffer the consequences if he lost the bet,” the union told its membership. (Congress did not increase the SEC’s budget, and Gensler did in fact lose this bet.)  The union has also decried Gensler’s “irrational hostility” to remote work, adding that “the union is being forced to litigate issues like this more frequently under Chair Gensler than under any previous SEC Chairman.” Overwork and staff attrition have heavy consequences when you’re the literal government. In March 2024, SEC attorneys were sanctioned by a judge for “gross abuse of power” in a crypto case involving a company called Digital Licensing (or, more familiarly, Debt Box). Following the sanctions, the Salt Lake City offices of the SEC were closed because of “significant attrition” — and while the Debt Box fiasco wasn’t the only reason it closed, it did play a role. Attorney sanctions are relatively rare, and sanctions of government lawyers are even more so.  The SEC chair term lasts five years, meaning Gensler’s time is up in June 2026. But regardless of who is elected, Gensler’s tenure may not continue into the next administration. Gensler has said he would “absolutely” stay for a second term under Biden, when Biden was still the Democratic nominee. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has targeted him specifically, with the former president saying he would “fire” Gensler. Vice President Kamala Harris’ donors have also been pushing to get rid of Gensler. Her exact stance on Gensler as a regulator isn’t clear, but Gensler is closely associated with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and the relationship between Warren and Harris has been tense. Legally, the president can fire SEC chairs — but the chair then becomes a normal SEC commissioner. In that case, they can only be removed for cause, says Anne Joseph O’Connell, a law professor at Stanford Law School. (Typically, though, chairs resign when a new party is elected, while the regular commissioners carry on.) It’s unclear what would happen in the case of a Harris administration — intraparty transitions don’t happen very often. Gensler is a symptom, not the disease It’s funny. There’s reason to think that Gensler is, in fact, bad at his job. But when the crypto industry calls for Gensler to get fired, it’s probably not because it’s concerned about the work-life balance of the SEC staff. The same people who want Gensler’s head on a platter are the least likely people in America to find common cause with the SEC union. And given the polarization in American politics, when Gensler is demonized by the crypto industry (and lumped in with the actually effective Lina Khan by the business class), he comes out looking good to a certain set of half-informed liberals. The real story here is the paralyzed regulatory state. The legislative chambers that could have increased the SEC’s budget and mitigated its problems of too much rulemaking with too little staff are gridlocked. (Maybe Gensler’s chaotic leadership would have rendered that a null effort, but it’s hard to say for sure.) As for the problems with what is sometimes termed “regulation by enforcement,” that’s exactly the incentive structure the right wing has set up by kneecapping agencies’ abilities to set rules. Gensler is a symptom, not the disease. When the SEC makes rules, it gets tied up in court, and so even when the industry wants rules, it’s not going to get them. Strong regulation isn’t nearly as dangerous for corporations as unpredictability is. Go ahead and fire Gensler — who cares? The next SEC chair isn’t going to be able to set predictable guidelines, either.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "By  Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. For almost as long as he’s been CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk has been bullshitting us about self-driving cars.  In 2016, he said Tesla self-driving cars were “two years away.” A year later, it was “six months, definitely,” and customers would be able to actually sleep in their Tesla in “two years.” In 2018, it was still a “year away” and would be “200 percent safer” than human driving. In 2019, he said there would be “feature complete full self-driving this year.” There hasn’t been a year go by without Musk promising the imminent arrival of a fully driverless Tesla.  This week, it’s finally here. Or at least that’s what Musk says. On October 10th, Tesla will reveal its long-awaited “robotaxi,” a supposedly fully autonomous vehicle that Musk has said will catapult the company into trillion-dollar status. It will be some combination of “Uber and Airbnb,” Musk said during a recent earnings call, allowing Tesla owners to serve as landlords for their driverless cars as they roam about the cityscape, picking up and dropping off strangers. And it will be futuristic in its design, with Bloomberg reporting that it will be a two-seater with butterfly wing doors. Musk has been calling it the “Cybercab.” The event, which will be held on the film lot of Warner Bros. in Burbank, California, will be the culmination of almost a decade of blown deadlines and broken promises from Musk, a moment when the richest man in the world will finally be forced to stop hiding behind his own bluster and actually show us what he’s been working on.  It’s a vulnerable time for Tesla. The company’s sales slumped in the first half of the year, as rising competition in the US and China dimmed Tesla’s star. Musk is fighting to reclaim his enormous $56 billion pay package, all while spreading misinformation on his social media platform and stumping for former President Donald Trump. And now there’s this product event, Tesla’s first since the unveiling of the Cybertruck in 2019.  Almost a decade of blown deadlines and broken promises Based on past Tesla events, don’t expect Musk to follow through on all his promises.  It seems likely that we’ll see a cool demo of a stylish-looking prototype, allowing Musk to claim a kind of victory for first impressions, even when the rough outlines of what he promises will barely hold up to scrutiny. The exaltations from bullish investors will give him enough cover to continue to make misleading declarations about what is and isn’t autonomous. And the safety experts and competitors who try to warn about the dangers of his approach will likely be drowned out or dismissed by his most ardent fans.  But either it works or it doesn’t. Waymo and others have already shown the world what real driverless technology looks like. It’s imperfect and it’s limited, but it’s undeniable. If Musk fails to deliver or shows off some obvious vaporware, his reputation — and Tesla’s stock price — could take a real hit.  “He’s really grasping for straws,” said Mary “Missy” Cummings, a robotics expert and former senior safety official at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. “He’s so desperate to try to drive more money into this equation that he’s doing things like this [event].” I first started covering Tesla for The Verge in 2016, the same year that Musk made one of his first predictions about the imminent arrival of self-driving cars. “You’ll be able to summon your car from across the country,” he said, citing as an example a Tesla owner beckoning their vehicle to drive solo from New York to meet him in Los Angeles. The company went even further in a blog post, boasting that “all Tesla vehicles produced in our factory — including Model 3 — will have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than a human driver.” That post has since been deleted from Tesla’s site, along with the company’s first “Master Plan,” as Musk attempts to scrub Tesla’s past of all his overreaching pronouncements.  “Substantially greater than a human driver” But more importantly, these kinds of statements fooled a lot of people into thinking the shiny new electric car in their driveway would have everything they needed to be fully autonomous and that those futuristic capabilities were just around the corner. Elon Musk would flip the switch and — presto — millions of cars would suddenly transform into robots. The media bought into it, portraying Tesla as being on the cusp of a historical evolution. And soon enough, the company’s stock started reflecting this attitude, especially after Tesla defied expectations with the Model 3.  Of course, none of it was true. Nearly a decade later, no Tesla vehicle on the road today is autonomous. Sure, the company has rolled out a series of brashly branded driver-assist features — first Autopilot, then Navigate on Autopilot, then Full Self-Driving, and finally Full Self-Driving (Supervised) — but they do not enable the car to drive without constant human supervision. You can’t sleep in your Tesla. You can’t summon it across town, let alone across the country. If you crash, you will be liable for what happens and who gets hurt. And if you attempt to fight the company on any of that, you will probably lose.  You can’t sleep in your Tesla Even those Tesla owners lured into thinking their vehicles were incognito robots would soon realize the cost of the company’s obfuscations. In 2021, Tesla first started offering subscriptions to its long-awaited Full Self-Driving feature, including a $1,500 hardware upgrade for those early owners who were wrongly informed that their vehicle would have “the hardware needed” for full autonomy. (It was later lowered to $1,000 after customer outcry.) There are plenty of people using Full Self-Driving (Supervised) today who will happily tell you how great it is and how they can’t imagine life without it. (Many also have YouTube channels they want to promote.) They will also argue over the semantics of autonomy. Shouldn’t something that controls the acceleration, braking, steering, and navigation also get to be called autonomous?  In the absence of data from Tesla, it’s impossible to say how good or terrible FSD is with any certainty. Crowd-sourced projects like FSD Community Tracker are extremely limited, only featuring data on a scant 200,000 miles of driving. Tesla says over 1 billion miles have been driven using FSD. But even the tracker’s tiny snapshot of data shows 119 miles between critical disengagements. Waymo drove 17,000 miles between disengagements in 2023, according to the California DMV.  While Tesla chased a much broader vision, Waymo leapt forward by realizing something more workable: remove the driver entirely and restrict the geography in which the vehicle can operate. Google, from which Waymo spun out in 2016, has long argued that advanced driver-assistance systems like Autopilot and FSD were inherently problematic. After all, human supervisors get bored and eventually zone out. The handoff between the vehicle and the driver can be fraught. It’s better to just cut the human out of the equation altogether.  Tesla is now latching onto Waymo’s better vision in unveiling a fully autonomous vehicle, the robotaxi. This is the vehicle that can silence all of those doubters. After all, Waymo doesn’t sell cars; it sells a service. Tesla sells cars. And wouldn’t it be infinitely cooler to own your own self-driving vehicle?  Tesla likes to say that Autopilot — and later FSD — is saving lives. In fact, Musk has gone even further, declaring any criticism of its driver-assistance products amounts to murder. “You need to think carefully about this,” he said in 2016, “because if, in writing some article that’s negative, you effectively dissuade people from using an autonomous vehicle, you’re killing people.” At the same time, he said that Tesla had no plans to assume legal liability for crashes or deaths that occurred when Autopilot was in use unless it was “something endemic to our design.” Even in the annals of Musk quotes that have aged poorly, these rank up there. At the time, only one person had died while using Autopilot — a reflection, perhaps, of the small number of Tesla vehicles on the road. Now, there are over 2 million Teslas all over the globe and a substantially higher number of deaths.  “Something endemic to our design” Presently, federal regulators are investigating at least 1,000 individual Tesla crashes involving Autopilot and FSD. Of those crashes, at least 44 people died. Investigators found that Autopilot — and, in some cases, FSD — was not designed to keep the driver engaged in the task of driving. Drivers would become overly complacent and lose focus. And when it came time to react, it was too late. Tesla has pushed out numerous updates to FSD over the years, so it can be tough to pin down what exactly is wrong with Tesla’s approach. Often, users flag a problem — the vehicle fails to recognize certain signage or a specific driving maneuver — and almost just as quickly, Tesla has an update available. That seems like a good thing — Tesla is responsive to problems and moves quickly to fix them — until you remember that real people’s lives are at stake. And the pedestrians and cyclists outside the vehicle never consented to participating in this experiment to teach cars to drive themselves.  Even the most recent version of the FSD software has its faults. An independent research firm recently tested versions 12.5.1 and 12.5.3 for over 1,000 miles and found it to be “surprisingly capable, while simultaneously problematic (and occasionally dangerously inept).” When errors occur, “they are occasionally sudden, dramatic, and dangerous.” In one instance, the group’s Tesla Model 3 ran a red light in the city during nighttime even though the cameras clearly detected the lights. FSD is the foundation for the robotaxi. Everything has been leading up to this moment. But the system struggles with basic perception issues, like wet roads and sunlight glare. FSD struggles to recognize motorcyclists: a 28-year-old motorcycle owner was killed outside of Seattle earlier this year by a Model S driver who was using the driver-assist feature.  The system struggles with basic perception issues Tesla used to publish quarterly safety reports that it would claim proved that Autopilot was safer than regular human driving — but it then stopped suddenly in 2022. It started up again this year with a new report that says there is only one crash for every 6.88 million miles of Autopilot-assisted driving, versus one for every 1.45 million miles of non-Autopilot driving. That’s over four times safer than normal human driving, according to Tesla.  This is the only safety data we have for Tesla’s driver-assist technology that is supposed to be a precursor to the fully autonomous robotaxi. But according to Noah Goodall, a civil engineer who has published several peer-reviewed studies about Tesla Autopilot, the company’s safety reports fail to take into account basic facts about traffic statistics, such as that crashes are more common on city roads and undivided roads than on the highway, where Autopilot is most often used. And it led him to the conclusion that Tesla may be miscounting crashes in order to make Autopilot seem safer than it actually is. “They fell apart pretty quickly, once you dove in just a little bit,” Goodall told me. “I have trouble publishing on this sometimes. Just because the reviewers are like, ‘Everyone knows these are fake, why are you pointing this out?’”  If there’s one thing on which everyone can agree, it’s that Tesla has a lot of data. With nearly 5 million drivers on the road globally, each vehicle is sending huge amounts of information back to the mothership for processing and labeling. Other companies, with only a fraction of the real-world miles, have to use simulated driving to fill in the gaps. But the sheer volume of data that Tesla is processing is overwhelming. The company relies on a small army of data annotators who review thousands of hours of footage from Tesla owners and the company’s in-house test drivers. And according to Business Insider, those workers are pushed to move quickly through as many images and videos as they can or face disciplinary action. Accuracy is secondary to speed.  “It’s a monumental effort,” Cummings, the robotics expert, said. “People think Teslas are learning on the fly. They have no idea how wrong they are, and just how much human preparation it takes to actually learn anything from the terabytes of data that are being gathered.” Tesla’s approach to the hardware of driverless vehicles also diverges from the rest of the industry. Musk infamously relies on a camera-only approach, in contrast to the widely used practice of relying on a “fusion” of different sensors, including radar, ultrasonic, and lidar, to power autonomous driving. Musk calls lidar, in particular, a “crutch” and claims any company that relies on the laser sensor is “doomed.” Waymo’s robotaxis are adorned with large, obvious sensors, a style expressly at odds with the sleekness of Musk’s vehicles.  Of course, Tesla does use lidar on its test vehicles, but just to validate FSD. They won’t be going on any customer cars, since lidar is still too expensive. With its tens of thousands of laser points projecting a second, lidar provides a critical layer of redundancy for the vehicle as well as a way to visualize the world in three dimensions.  The idea that you can introduce a fully autonomous vehicle without the full suite of sensors that power every other AV on earth strains credulity for most experts on the technology.  “Why on earth would you want to tie one hand behind your back when you’re solving an almost impossible problem?” said Phil Koopman, an AV expert from Carnegie Mellon University. “And we know it’s going to be big bucks, so don’t skimp on the hardware.” What is an autonomous car? It sounds like a simple question, but the answer is trickier than it seems. To help clear things up, SAE International, a US organization that represents automotive engineers, created a six-step guide to automation. Intended for engineers rather than the general public, it ranged from Level 0, meaning no automation whatsoever, to Level 5, meaning the vehicle can drive itself anywhere at any time without any human intervention. And there’s plenty of room for error and misunderstanding. A problem we’ve seen is what researcher Liza Dixon calls “autonowashing,” or any effort to overhype something as autonomous when it’s not.  Most experts dismiss Level 5 as pure science fiction. Waymo and others operate Level 4 vehicles, but very few people really believe that Level 5 is attainable. Level 5 would require “an astronomical amount of technological development, maintenance, and testing,” Torc Robotics, a company developing self-driving trucks, says. Others call it a pipe dream.  Except Musk. At a conference in Shanghai, Musk said with supreme confidence that the company “will have the basic functionality for Level 5 autonomy complete this year.” That was in July 2020. He’ll likely try to pass off the Tesla robotaxi as the endpoint of this achievement, the vehicle that will help usher in this wildly implausible goal. And it’s important to see through the bluster and bullshit and measure it against what he’s promised in the past and also what other players have already achieved.  Tesla’s history is littered with fanciful ideas that never panned out — like a solar-powered Supercharger network, battery swapping, or robotic snake-style chargers. But Musk never bet his entire company, his reputation, and most importantly, his net worth, on those projects. This one is different. And soon enough, we’ll know whether the Tesla robotaxi is the exception to the rule or just another guy dancing in a robot costume.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

            "content": "In an effort to find a power source big enough to fuel its ambitious artificial intelligence business, Microsoft has sought to revive a shuttered nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania. AI notably needs an absurd amount of energy to function, and companies have floated nuclear power as a potential solution. In September, Microsoft signed a deal to re-open the power plant on Three Mile Island, the likes of which has been shuttered since 2019. The plant is notorious for having been the site of a meltdown—the worst in American history—that occurred in 1979. The financials of Microsoft’s deal have recently come to light, with a new report suggesting that the tech company and its business partner want American taxpayers to front some of the risks associated with the plant’s re-opening. The Washington Post reports that Constellation Energy, the utility company that owns and operates the reactor at Three Mile Island, filed an application for a $1.6 billion federal loan guarantee with the U.S. Department of Energy in May. The Post writes that the application has already cleared an initial review and is now at the stage where specifics of the agreement are being negotiated. A loan guarantee would essentially ensure a certain amount of federal financial support for the deal, regardless of whether it ultimately succeeds or not. The controversy from this potential agreement stems from the fact that it could be seen to offload over a billion dollars of financial risk onto the shoulders of taxpayers. Should anything go wrong with the business arrangement and were Constellation to default on its obligations, the government would still be forced to cover up to $1.6 billion in costs, the newspaper reports. Constellation has rushed to assure observers that no such thing will happen. “Rest assured that to the extent we may seek a loan, Constellation will guarantee full repayment,” Constellation told the Post. “Any notion that taxpayers are taking on risk here is fanciful given that any loan will be backstopped by Constellation’s entire $80-billion-plus value.” Gizmodo reached out to Constellation and Microsoft for comment. The deal has already enjoyed a number of federal tax credits (some of which may be worth as much as $200 million a year for the two companies, the Post writes), which would seem to imply that the government is supportive of the project. The U.S. Energy Secretary has openly complimented the effort, claiming the government is “bullish” on it. Some commentators have noted that, while most nuclear power deals are heavily facilitated through federal handouts, this deal is being almost exclusively financed by Microsoft and it intends to be the main beneficiary of the plant’s services. That said, other voices have noted that the deal will likely require more federal dollars as it progresses. “The $1.6 billion is just the start,” Stanford professor of civil and environmental engineering Mark Jacobson told The New Republic. “Microsoft will be asking for government handouts just like most all other aged nuclear reactor owners have asked in multiple states.” If Microsoft’s deal is finalized, the Three Mile Island reactor would be restarted by the year 2028. Microsoft would then have a 20-year contract with Constellation that assured it ownership over 100 percent of the plant’s output during that time. \nMicrosoftThree Mile Island  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          One person can win the million dollar jackpot and ten additional winners will receive $10,000 for just using Bing.\n         \n          It also features an upgraded mic with auto-mute and voice isolation.\n         \n          Leaked sale of a Intel Core Ultra 7 268V rendition of the Surface Laptop shows Microsoft isn’t putting all its eggs in the ARM basket.\n         \n          Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are all pushing for a nuclear-power fueled future.

            "content": "A few days before Halloween feels like the perfect moment for this update: that new Scary Movie entry, teased at CinemaCon earlier this year, is officially moving full steam ahead. Even better, the Wayans Brothers, who made the first two Scary Movie horror comedies but were absent for parts three through five, are back for the reboot. This news comes from Deadline, which notes the sixth Scary Movie will be a theatrical release through Miramax and Paramount and will start filming next year. Marlon, Shawn, and Keenan Ivory Wayans—the latter directed the first two Scary Movies; the former both co-wrote and co-starred—told the trade, “We couldn’t be more excited to be a part of the new Scary Movie and work with each other again. This is a franchise we created more than 20 years ago. We remember people laughing in the aisles and hope to see that happen again. We look forward to working with Jonathan Glickman and his team at the new Miramax to bring these laughs to theaters, where they belong. It’s a double reunion.” The most recent Scary Movie was released in 2013; it was a box-office disappointment after an established track record of hits. The 2000 original, which parodied the then-newly popular Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer slasher franchises, is still the top-grosser at over $278 million. Scary Movie 2 followed in 2001, skewering The Exorcist and House on Haunted Hill; Scary Movie 3, an oft-cited fan favorite, took on The Ring and Signs (with a dash of 8 Mile, too). Part four had more M. Night Shyamalan (The Village) and Japanese horror (The Grudge) to mock, along with Saw; part five’s diminishing returns took on Mama, Paranormal Activity, and Black Swan. So far there’s no word on what the new Scary Movie might skewer, but if you look at the past decade-plus of horror releases, there’s so much for the Wayans to riff on, including The Conjuring films, the entire scope of “elevated horror” (Get Out, Hereditary, The Witch), tech terrors (M3GAN is already campy, but imagine a Scary Movie version of her!), the new Universal Monster movies, and maybe even the meta idea of reboots and legacy sequels (The Exorcist, Halloween, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice). In particular, Scream and I Know What You Do Last Summer are active franchises again, so Scary Movie would also have good reason to check in with some old favorites. There’s also no word on who might star in Scary Movie part six, other than (presumably) the Wayans—but we’d love to see an Anna Faris-Regina Hall reunion as part of this new project. (Earlier this year, Faris said she was open to the idea). What do you think: is the world finally ready for more Scary Movie? Let us know below. Want more io9 news?

            "content": "A Saudi-backed business school in Switzerland has launched a Doomsday Clock to warn the world about the harms of “uncontrolled artificial general intelligence,” what it calls a “god-like” AI. Imagine if the people selling offices on Excel spreadsheets in the 1980s tried to tell workers that the software was a pathway to birthing a god and used a ticking Rolex to do it and you’ll have an idea of what we’re dealing with here. Michael Wade—the clock’s creator and a TONOMUS Professor of Strategy and Digital at IMD Business School in Lausanne, Switzerland, and Director of the TONOMUS Global Center for Digital and AI Transformation (good lord)—unveiled the clock in a recent op-ed for TIME. A clock ticking down to midnight is a once-powerful and now stale metaphor from the atomic age. It’s an image so old and stayed that it just celebrated its 75th anniversary. After America dropped nukes on Japan, some researchers and scientists who’d worked on developing the weapon formed the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Their project has been to warn the world of its impending destruction. The Doomsday Clock is one of the ways they do it. Every year experts in various fields—from nuclear weapons to climate change to, yes, artificial intelligence—gather and discuss just how screwed the world is. Then they set the clock. The closer to midnight, the closer humanity is to its doom. Right now it’s at 90 seconds to midnight, the closest the clock has ever been set. Wade and IMD have no relation to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and the Doomsday Clock is its own thing. Wade’s creation is the AI Safety Clock. “The Clock’s current reading—29 minutes to midnight—is a measure of just how close we are to the critical tipping point where uncontrolled AGI could bring about existential risks,” he said in his Time article. “While no catastrophic harm has happened yet, the breakneck speed of AI development and the complexities of regulation mean that all stakeholders must stay alert and engaged.” Silicon Valley’s loudest AI proponents love to lean into the nuclear metaphor. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman compared the work of his company to the Manhattan Project. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA) wrote that America’s rush to embrace AI is similar to Oppenheimer’s pursuit of the atomic bomb. Some of this fear and concern might be genuine but it’s all marketing at the end of the day. We’re in the middle of a hype cycle around AI. Companies are promising it can deliver unprecedented returns and destroy labor costs. Machines, they say, will soon do everything for us. The reality is that AI is useful but also mostly moves labor and production costs to other parts of the chain where the end user doesn’t see it. The fear of AI becoming so advanced that it wipes humanity out is just another kind of hype. Doomerism about word calculators and predictive modeling systems is just another way to get people excited about the possibilities of this technology and mask the real harm it creates. At a recent Tesla event, robot bartenders poured drinks for attendees. By all appearances, they were controlled remotely by humans. LLMs burn a ton of water and electricity when coming up with answers and often rely on the subtle and constant attention of human “trainers” who labor in poor countries and work for a pittance. Humans use the tech to flood the internet with non-consensually created nude images of other humans. These are just a few of the real-world harms already caused by Silicon’s rapid embrace of AI. And as long as you’re afraid of Skynet coming to life and wiping out humanity in the future, you aren’t paying attention to the problems right in front of you. The Bulletin’s Doomsday Clock may be inscrutable on the surface, but there’s an army of impressive minds behind the metaphor churning out work every day about the real risks of nuclear weapons and new technologies. In September, the Bulletin put a picture of Altman in an article debunking hyperbolic claims about how AI might be used to engineer new bioweapons. “For all the doomsaying, there are actually many uncertainties in how AI will affect bioweapons and the wider biosecurity arena,” the article said. It also stressed that talk of extreme scenarios around AI helps people avoid having more difficult conversations. “The challenge, as it has been for more than two decades, is to avoid apathy and hyperbole about scientific and technological developments that impact biological disarmament and efforts to keep biological weapons out of the war plans and arsenals of violent actors,” the Bulletin said. “Debates about AI absorb high-level and community attention and … they risk an overly narrow threat focus that loses sight of other risks and opportunities.” There are dozens of articles like this published every year by the people who run the Doomsday Clock. The Swiss AI clock has no such scientific backing, though it claims to be monitoring such articles in its FAQ. What it has, instead, is money from Saudi Arabia. Wade’s position at the school is possible thanks to funding from TONOMUS, a subsidiary of NEOM. NEOM is Saudi Arabia’s much-hyped city of the future that it’s attempting to build in the desert. Among the other promises of NEOM are robot dinosaurs, flying cars, and a giant artificial moon. You’ll forgive me if I don’t take Wade or the AI Safety Clock seriously. \nAiElon Muskmanhattan projectNEOM  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The case is a scary peek at the future of buying votes.\n         \n          Philadelphia District Attorney called the giveaway a \"grift\" and \"one of the great scams of the last 50 years.\"\n         \n          With hours to go before America votes, Trump’s surrogates spent their time building up a myth around a squirrel.\n         \n          Older models struggled with depth issues in 2D images, but the novel neural network handles these problems with ease.\n         \n          Thousand of Dublin residents were misled by an AI chum website promoting events that aren't real.\n         \n          China’s People’s Liberation Army is using Llama 13B for military applications.

            "content": "A Texas federal jury has awarded American Airlines a whopping $9.4 million in a lawsuit filed against Skiplagged.com, a website that helps travelers get cheaper flights by booking flights with a connection and then abandoning the connecting flight to the final destination. The airline industry loathes Skiplagged, even though there’s technically nothing illegal about the practice it’s promoting. Last week, the court awarded $4.7 million from Skiplagged’s revenue based on an estimate of lost fares and another $4.7 million for copyright infringement, as it was scraping American’s flight schedules in violation of the airline’s terms of service.  American also sued over trademark infringement, claiming that Skiplagged was using the American logo on its website to make it appear the site was endorsed by American; the judge disagreed on that one.  As of today, Skiplagged still returns fares and routes from American Airlines. It’s unclear if that will change or how this judgement will impact Skiplagged’s business. We have reached out for comment. Most airlines expressly prohibit skiplagging—effectively an exploit of the airline business model—and use technology to try and detect when customers are doing it. Travelers have reported being banned from certain airlines for years after being caught. The concept of skiplagging—and why airlines hate it—is somewhat complicated to understand. Let’s say you want to travel from Boston to San Francisco, and a search on Google Flights returns one-way trips costing $300. You could instead book a flight from Boston to Sacramento with a layover in San Francisco for $199. In essence, what Skiplagged is doing is revealing this “hidden” itinerary that gets you to San Francisco for $100 less (Skiplagged charges users a small fee, usually $10). All you do is book the flight to Sacramento, and when you land in San Francisco (your actual intended destination), just leave the airport and abandon the connecting flight.  It seems counterintuitive — why would flying to San Francisco and taking another flight to Sacramento be cheaper than just flying to San Francisco? Essentially, major airlines work on a model in which direct flights between every city would not make sense — how many people really want to fly from Boston to Sacramento? So in the interest of efficiency, the airlines use major cities like San Francisco as central connecting hubs for flights to other destinations with less demand. The airline is charging the passenger based on demand to Sacramento, offering a reduced fare to ensure it fills those seats to Sacramento and generates at least some revenue. Airlines also feel they can charge more for direct flights because of the convenience factor for passengers.  But skiplagging messes with the business model. In the case of skiplagging, airlines use algorithms to estimate how many passengers will miss their flight, and then intentionally overbook the flight to generate extra revenue. The airline gets revenue from the person who missed the flight, and additional revenue from someone else who in turn took that seat. When a passenger makes the first leg of a flight, they have to assume that the passenger will also make their connecting flight and cannot overbook that seat. That’s potential revenue left on the table for American Airlines.  It’s hard to feel sympathy for the airlines in this case. Anyone who travels regularly knows how gate agents constantly plead with passengers to change their flight when a plane has been overbooked and too many people show up. The airlines are playing games to maximize revenue and frustrate customers—skiplagging just turns the tables on them, returning some power back to the customer. But a judge decided that American’s terms of service against unauthorized scraping are clear, and Skiplagged decided to violate them anyway. It’s not dissimilar from the way in which AI companies have decided to ignore terms of service agreements to scrape content sites.  Fortunately, you don’t actually need to use Skiplagged to find these fares. If you’re clever enough, you can do it using any other travel booking site like Google Flights or Expedia. Just don’t do it too frequently on the same airline or you may well get caught. And keep in mind that you cannot travel with checked luggage using this method, as your luggage will be sent to the final destination. Traveling light is better anyway.  \nskiplagged  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n      Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Though Redbox, the DVD vending machine company, is officially dead, the company’s disc-dispensing kiosks are still strewn all over America. The machines still work and there are still hundreds of DVDs inside of them. Lately, those machines have been getting sold off to various hardware enthusiasts who have, in turn, been reverse-engineering them to figure out how they work, and to dispense the movies trapped inside. Well, with one exception: Twister. 404 Media reports that, for some weird reason, the army of amateur hardware enthusiasts who have been futzing with the company’s machines cannot figure out how to get the 1996 disaster flick out of them. To illuminate this bizarre conundrum, 404 cites a series of Reddit threads and Discord communities where the hardware pros have been posting about the issue. “Sorry, there was a problem with the purchased items in your cart. Please remove these items from your cart in order to continue,” an alert from the kiosk reads, whenever someone tries to rent Twister. This issue impacts “seemingly every Redbox kiosk and is not happening with any other movie,” the outlet writes. 404 Media writes that the machine’s refusal to dispense Twister “appears to be either a licensing dispute or software bug.” The outlet further states that one of the prevailing theories is that “Redbox’s licensing agreement for Twister ran out ahead of the release of its sequel, Twisters, and there is a hard-coded date where checking out with Twister in your cart was disabled.” That said, 404 notes nobody has been able to confirm this. Redbox swept onto the video rental scene in the early aughts, not long before the industry’s mom-and-pop store paradigm would be disrupted by the advent of Netflix and video streaming. Originally an offshoot of McDonald’s, the company expanded aggressively in the years after its founding. At one point, Redbox surpassed Blockbuster as the largest video rental retailer in the country. Now, of course, that’s all over, thanks to the dominance of streaming. Two years ago, a subsidiary of the company that publishes the Chicken Soup for the Soul self-help book series bought Redbox. Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment took on $325 million in debt when it acquired the company, with the plan of reinventing the ailing business. Instead, the company wracked up an enormous amounts of debt and was forced to file for bankruptcy this past August. As part of the bankruptcy deal, Redbox had to be liquidated. The Verge reports that when Chicken Soup filed for bankruptcy this summer, it had been “sued over a dozen times over unpaid bills.” \nRedboxtwister  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Hackers reveal the old Redbox kiosks can be easily hacked for users' names and some financial info.

            "content": "A U.S. government watchdog group is worried that one of Washington’s nuclear agencies isn’t doing enough to study and prevent the economic impact of a nuclear dirty bomb. The September 30th report comes from the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan group that studies various issues for Congress. In its report the GAO called out the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, saying it “has not taken steps to address certain radiological security risks.” The NRC is the part of the federal government that oversees nuclear waste, regulates radiological material, and oversees reactor safety. And what, according to the GAO, was the Commission’s great sin? “NRC has not taken actions to incorporate consideration of socioeconomic consequences into its regulations,” the report said. A dirty bomb is a rare thing, so rare in fact that they’ve never been used in a war. The concept is that someone attaches an explosive to radioactive material. When the bomb goes off it spreads the radioactive material, poisons an area, and kills people. A dirty bomb isn’t comparable, in any way, to a nuclear weapon. Most experts agree that the bulk of the damage would come from the initial blast and not the radioactive material itself. In the popular imagination, a dirty bomb would send radioactive particles high into the air where the wind would disperse them throughout a large area. In reality, most radioactive material is so heavy that it doesn’t travel very far. From 2010 to 2014, Israel detonated a series of dirty bombs in the desert near the Dimona nuclear reactor. Israel said it was conducting the tests as a defensive measure in order to practice cleanup and get an idea of what its effects would be. They weren’t great. Israel detonated 20 different bombs that included a payload of 99mTc, a common radioactive substance used in medical imaging. The particles didn’t spread far. Despite the incredible rarity and unlikelihood of a dirty bomb, America became obsessed with it after 9/11. If terrorists could slip into the country and fly planes into the World Trade Center, wouldn’t it be possible for them to steal some radioactive material from a hospital and build a dirty bomb? In the decades after 9/11, many government agencies got serious about shoring up shortcomings around security and regulations regarding nuclear materials. According to the GAO, however, the NRC hasn’t kept up. “NRC has not implemented 11 out of 18 actions we have recommended since 2012,” the report said. “NRC has not taken action to consider socioeconomic consequences in its decision-making criteria for determining security requirements for radioactive materials.” The report constantly reminded the reader that dirty bombs are bad for business. “Several studies…43 radiological experts we previously convened, officials we interviewed for this report, and the NRC-led Task Force all agree—and recent events corroborate—that the socioeconomic consequences from a dirty bomb would be severe,” it said. “For example, in 2017 and 2018, Sandia National Laboratories estimated that a dirty bomb…could cause an estimated $24 to $30 billion in damages and economic losses, most of which would be socioeconomic.” As evidence of the real-life impact of this dirty bomb fear, the GAO pointed to an incident that had nothing at all to do with explosives. In 2019, a government contractor pierced a medical device containing cesium-137 at the University of Washington. This was an industrial accident, not a dirty bomb, but—according to the GAO—the economic impact was severe. “Over 80 research programs valued in the tens of millions of dollars were affected, and over 200 researchers and laboratory staff had to be relocated,” the GAO said. “Several researchers could not find replacement laboratories to host their research and were compelled to seek employment elsewhere. NNSA estimated the total cost of the incident—including cleanup, remediation, reconstruction, and other costs—to be $156 million.” Thirteen people were exposed during this accident and had to be decontaminated. “Though not a dirty bomb, and not an uninsured incident, the accident illustrates the costs that can result from the release of even a small quantity of material,” the GAO said in a 2021 report on the incident. \ndirty bombradioactive  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n      Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "The Department of Justice has laid out its broad-strokes plan for ending Google’s monopoly over internet search after winning its antitrust case against the company in August. The sweeping changes could end Google’s position as the default search engine on billions of devices and require the company to share key information about its search algorithms with competitors. The regulators’ proposals, laid out Tuesday in a filing with the D.C. federal court where the antitrust case was heard, are aimed not only at rectifying Google’s past anti-competitive practices but also at preventing it from unfairly dominating emerging technologies, particularly internet searches enabled by generative AI tools. Any changes to Google’s business model will take time, if they happen at all. The DOJ’s filing indicates the general categories of remedies it might seek but the agency still has significant work to do before it puts forward a detailed plan for the court to rule on. Google, meanwhile, has said it will appeal the court’s decision. Google described the DOJ’s proposals as “radical” and said “government overreach in a fast-moving industry may have negative unintended consequences for American innovation and America’s consumers.” The first step necessary to unwind Google’s illegal monopoly, according to the DOJ, will likely be to “limit or end” the company’s use of contracts and unfair revenue-sharing agreements that have enshrined Google as the pre-installed search engine on all Android devices and the Chrome browser. It could potentially also include forcing Google’s parent company, Alphabet, to split off the Android and Chrome divisions of its business. Google’s search tools are powered by the huge amount of data its web crawlers have indexed and the ranking algorithms that prioritize which results users see first. To level the playing field for competitors, the DOJ said it might try to make the company share the indexes, search results, underlying ranking signals, and models used for Google search, including AI-powered search. “Google’s ability to leverage its monopoly power to feed artificial intelligence features is an emerging barrier to competition and risks further entrenching Google’s dominance,” the DOJ wrote, adding that potential remedies could include prohibiting the company from signing contracts with web publishers that deny rival search engines access to their sites and forcing Google to allow publishers to opt out of having their content scraped and used to generate AI summaries at the top of search results. The final category of remedies the DOJ proposed would aim to spread the wealth generated by advertisements attached to internet searches by making it easier for smaller competitors to enter markets without being crushed by Google’s economy of scale and by requiring Google to be more transparent with advertisers in its ad auctions. \nDepartment of JusticeGoogleInternet search  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          One person can win the million dollar jackpot and ten additional winners will receive $10,000 for just using Bing.\n         \n          Thousand of Dublin residents were misled by an AI chum website promoting events that aren't real.\n         \n          The new features promise to allow users to use the chatbot more like a search engine.\n         \n          It'll also (finally) inform you about lane merges in advance when you're out driving on the highway.\n         \n          What is the best place to grab a steak in London?\n         \n          No one wants AI to infest their search results, so use the “the disenshittification Konami code.”\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

This latest version of Microsoft’s renowned productivity suite is available for a limited time at $179, a significant $70 discount from its regular price of $249. See at StackSocial Office 2024 Home & Business represents a substantial update to the popular software package which hasn’t seen a major revision since 2021. This release is particularly noteworthy as Microsoft has been primarily focused on promoting its subscription-based Microsoft 365 service in recent years. However, for those who prefer a one-time purchase over a recurring subscription, Microsoft Office 2024 Home & Business offers is a great alternative. The package includes the latest versions of essential productivity applications: Word for document creation, Excel for spreadsheets and data analysis, PowerPoint for presentations, Outlook for email and calendar management and OneNote for note-taking and organization. These are full-featured desktop applications compatible with Windows 11, Windows 10, and macOS. One of the key advantages of this offer is that it provides a lifetime license for a single PC or Mac. This means users can enjoy the software indefinitely without the need for annual renewals or monthly payments. In the long run, this can prove to be significantly more cost-effective than subscribing to Microsoft 365, especially for users who don’t require the additional cloud-based features and regular updates offered by the subscription model. This deal for Office 2024 Home & Business should not be confused with the more basic Office Home 2024 which is priced at $149 but only includes Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The Home & Business edition provides considerably more value with the addition of Outlook and OneNote which makes it a more comprehensive solution for both personal and professional use. The software also comes with access to Microsoft support resources so that users can get assistance if they encounter any issues. Additionally, while it’s not a cloud-based service like Microsoft 365, Office 2024 Home & Business is designed to work seamlessly with Microsoft Teams and facilitates collaboration in today’s increasingly remote work environments. For sure, this StackSocial deal on Microsoft Office 2024 Home & Business is a great opportunity for individuals and small businesses looking to upgrade their productivity tools without committing to a subscription model. At $179 instead of $249, it offers substantial savings on a powerful, up-to-date software suite that will serve users well for the foreseeable future.

This trend is exemplified by OpenAI’s recent plans for ChatGPT Plus, its premium subscription service. According to reports, the company intends to increase the price from its current $20 per month to $22 by the end of 2024 with further hikes planned over the next five years, potentially reaching $44 per month by 2029. This significant price increase reflects the mounting pressure on AI companies to balance their financial losses with user satisfaction and investor expectations. OpenAI’s decision comes in the wake of a massive $6 billion funding round, highlighting the substantial costs associated with developing and maintaining cutting-edge AI infrastructure. Despite generating $300 million in monthly revenue as of August 2024, the company is projected to lose around $5 billion this year due to expenses such as employee salaries, office rent, and the enormous computing power required to run AI systems. As AI technology becomes increasingly integral to various industries, users are finding themselves caught in a web of multiple subscriptions, each with its own rising costs. This trend extends beyond just ChatGPT with other AI services and tools also experiencing price hikes. This is where 1minAI comes in, which is a game-changing platform that offers a compelling alternative to the growing expense of individual AI subscriptions. For a limited time, users can secure lifetime access to 1minAI for just $39.99, an impressive 82% discount from its regular price of $234. This innovative service consolidates multiple top-tier AI models including ChatGPT, Gemini Pro, Meta AI (Llama) and Mistral AI, into a single user-friendly interface. See 1minAI at StackSocial 1minAI stands out by providing a comprehensive suite of AI-powered features designed to cater to a wide range of professional needs. From advanced language models for content creation to image generation and editing capabilities, the platform offers tools for content creators, marketers, designers, and business professionals alike. Users can seamlessly switch between tasks such as generating copy, creating visuals, transcribing audio, and analyzing PDFs, all within a single platform. With its Pro plan, 1minAI is offering an impressive 1 million credits per month for just $39.99 as a lifetime deal which is a significant discount from its original $234 price tag. This comprehensive package empowers users to generate up to 805,555 words, research 1,933 SEO keywords, create 161 images, upscale 241 images, remove backgrounds from 24 images, convert 120,833 characters to speech, transcribe 4,833 seconds of audio, and produce 12 videos monthly. For those requiring even more robust features, 1minAI offers two additional tiers: the Business plan and the Advanced Business plan. The Business plan is priced at a lifetime rate of $59.99 and doubles the credit allocation to 2 million per month, effectively doubling all the benefits of the Pro plan. For power users, the Advanced Business plan provides a staggering 4 million credits monthly for a one-time payment of $99 down from its regular price of $540. This top-tier option quadruples the Pro plan’s capabilities, making it an unbeatable choice for large-scale operations and agencies that demand high-volume AI assistance across various domains.

            "content": "Redbox is dead, and with it a big question looms: What to do with all those giant kiosks? The answer seems to be that retailers will have to dispose of them at their own cost, as Redbox’s parent company went into liquidation with hundreds of millions in unpaid debts. The Wall Street Journal reports that chains like CVS and Safeway are facing a predicament. They each have thousands of Redbox kiosks on their premises that are taking up space and have cost them a lot in electricity. Brian Rady, a former finance executive at Redbox, told the Journal that it will easily cost $500 a piece to remove the kiosks, and added many outdoor units are embedded in the concrete. You might think to yourself, Redbox seems like an easy business with low overhead. They’re just self-serve machines that spit out DVDs. But DVDs continue to die in popularity (sorry, it’s really happening folks), and the electricity costs running the Redbox machines alone is high. Walgreens in arguing for permission to trash them told a judge it was spending a whopping $184,000 a month to power 5,400 kiosks. They also need to be regularly maintained by a fleet of technicians, and DVDs need to be frequently replaced with new titles. Put that all together and it’s really not a good business. But hey, if you do still have a DVD collection, these machines can hold an estimated 500 discs. While most machines will be salvaged for scrap, some film enthusiasts have already taken the initiative to visit retailers and take the machines home. Jacob Helton, a 19-year-old from North Carolina, convinced a contactor hauling one from a drugstore to let him have it instead. “I wanted a Redbox machine because I felt like Redbox is important in the history of American media,” he told the Journal. “Its collapse marks the end of the video rental era.” Redbox’s parent owner, Chicken Soup for the Soul, briefly went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy over the summer, which would’ve cleared its debt and let the company continue operating. That was quickly converted to Chapter 7 after a judge determined it was unlikely the company could be viable going forward even with a lower debt overhang. It’s hard not to see why. Redbox peaked all the way back in 2013 at over $1.97 billion in revenue and more than 43,000 kiosks across the U.S. and Canada. It was appreciated especially by the budget-conscious and those living in areas with poor internet connections. It also sometimes offered movies on DVD that weren’t available on a subscription streaming service. But the business had been on the inevitable decline for years as people finally dropped DVDs, and 2022 saw Redbox sold to Chicken Soup for the Soul for $357 million. The pandemic especially hurt Redbox with a lack of new releases, but 2022 was boom times for streaming and its new owner hoped it could use the brand to bolster a new digital service. In 2019, Chicken Soup for the Soul had purchased Crackle from Sony. Unsurprisingly, that didn’t work out—even the Disneys and Comcasts of the world found streaming has been a tough business to crack—and Chicken Soup for the Soul was sinking in debt that it assumed when it bought Redbox. It reported a loss of $636 million for 2023 and quickly fell behind on paying Redbox’s vendors. It’s very much a zero-interest rate story like so many others in tech from that time. Redbox’s shutdown was ugly, as it had fallen behind on many of its debts, including revenue-share proceeds to the retailers that hosted its kiosks and licensing fees owed to the movie studios. It never paid its own employees their final weeks of pay, so it’s not surprising that once it finally went under, it didn’t do anything to remove all those kiosks from retailers’ stores. \nEntertainmentRedbox  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Hardware nerds just want to see Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt outrun a tornado.

            "content": "A former researcher at the OpenAI has come out against the company’s business model, writing, in a personal blog, that he believes the company is not complying with U.S. copyright law. That makes him one of a growing chorus of voices that sees the tech giant’s data-hoovering business as based on shaky (if not plainly illegitimate) legal ground. “If you believe what I believe, you have to just leave the company,” Suchir Balaji recently told the New York Times. Balaji, a 25-year-old UC Berkeley graduate who joined OpenAI in 2020 and went on to work on GPT-4, said he originally became interested in pursuing a career in the AI industry because he felt the technology could “be used to solve unsolvable problems, like curing diseases and stopping aging.” Balaji worked for OpenAI for four years before leaving the company this summer. Now, Balaji says he sees the technology being used for things he doesn’t agree with, and believes that AI companies are “destroying the commercial viability of the individuals, businesses and internet services that created the digital data used to train these A.I. systems,” the Times writes. This week, Balaji posted an essay on his personal website, in which he argued that OpenAI was breaking copyright law. In the essay, he attempted to show “how much copyrighted information” from an AI system’s training dataset ultimately “makes its way to the outputs of a model.“ Balaji’s conclusion from his analysis was that ChatGPT’s output does not meet the standard for “fair use,” the legal standard that allows the limited use of copyrighted material without the copyright holder’s permission. “The only way out of all this is regulation,” Balaji later told the Times, in reference to the legal issues created by AI’s business model. Gizmodo reached out to OpenAI for comment. In a statement provided to the Times, the tech company offered the following rebuttal to Balaji’s criticism: “We build our A.I. models using publicly available data, in a manner protected by fair use and related principles, and supported by longstanding and widely accepted legal precedents. We view this principle as fair to creators, necessary for innovators, and critical for US competitiveness.” It should be noted that the New York Times is currently suing OpenAI for unlicensed use of its copyrighted material. The Times claimed that the company and its partner, Microsoft, had used millions of news articles from the newspaper to train its algorithm, which has since sought to compete for the same market. The newspaper is not alone. OpenAI is currently being sued by a broad variety of celebrities, artists, authors, and coders, all of whom claim to have had their work ripped off by the company’s data-hoovering algorithms. Other well-known folks/organizations who have sued OpenAI include Sarah Silverman, Ta-Nahisi Coates, George R. R. Martin, Jonathan Franzen, John Grisham, the Center for Investigative Reporting, The Intercept, a variety of newspapers (including The Denver Post and the Chicago Tribune), and a variety of YouTubers, among others. Despite a mixture of confusion and disinterest from the general public, the list of people who have come out to criticize the AI industry’s business model continues to grow. Celebrities, tech ethicists, and legal experts are all skeptical of an industry that continues to grow in power and influence while introducing troublesome new legal and social dilemmas to the world. \nArtificial intelligenceOpenAISam Altman  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Meta believes in the America spirit and is ready to beat China on the battlefield of AI advancement.\n         \n          The company also recently shuttered a studio developing a AAA multiplatform game.\n         \n          Even if AI turns out to be a hype cycle, getting a lot of clean energy could make it worth the hassle.\n         \n          Being alive is an indescribably weird and remarkable experience... but we may not even be.\n         \n          Older models struggled with depth issues in 2D images, but the novel neural network handles these problems with ease.\n         \n          Thousand of Dublin residents were misled by an AI chum website promoting events that aren't real.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Matthew Lillard has been in the acting game for decades, and depending on when you grew up, you mainly know him thanks to Hackers, Scream, or Scooby-Doo (both live-action and animation). He’s one of those stars who seems to be always working, and to hear him tell it, that’s because he put the work in to become a reliable actor. Business Insider recently did a spotlight on Lillard, wherein he reminisced about the arc of his career. After breaking out in the ’90s, he became “caught up in this drive of trying to be ‘famous,’ and the success of what I was doing.” The critical and financial failure of Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed had him thinking he’d “never work again,” and later an offer to appear on Dancing With the Stars, made him realize he “really just wanted to be a great actor.” So he decided to reset his life by looking at non-acting ventures (like his liquor business) and teaching acting while taking on roles that he ffelt would best suit him as a performer. When he wasn’t voicing Shaggy in Scooby media, he spent the last decade in supporting roles on Good Girls, Twin Peaks, and Halt and Catch Fire. But it was last year’s Blumhouse hit Five Nights at Freddy’s that’s put bigger eyes on him, particularly with younger audiences. Lillard admitted to Business Insider that he wasn’t entirely sure what to make of his role as William Afton at first, since the original scripts only gave him about “two lines.” He called it a “leap of faith” role, and it was only after director Emma Tammi told him that Afton would be more central in a planned trilogy that he really got the picture. He, along with leading man Josh Hutcherson, are both returning for the sequel coming out in December 2025. Beyond that, Lillard will also appear in next year’s Life of Chuck from Mike Flanagan. But what about Scream, which has brought back surviving characters (and some not) for its newer sequels? He reiterated to Business Insider that he’d be fine to return if the conversation arose, and separately told GamesRadar the franchise is in a “really good place.” His feelings on the violence aside—to him, Ghostface shouldn’t have had a shotgun in Scream 6—he said he hopes director Kevin Williamson (who wrote the first and fourth movies) takes Scream 7 “in a brand new, brave, and exciting direction so that we can sort of find different colors and different joys.” Want more io9 news?

            "content": "In August, the Federal Trade Commission announced a ban on writing, buying, or selling fake reviews online. Under the new rule, anyone who participates in a fake online review could be fined up to $51,744. The commissioners voted in agreement and it’s now in effect. This mandate includes AI-generated reviews (which have recently invaded Amazon) and also encompasses dishonest celebrity endorsements as well as testimonials posted by a company’s employees, relatives, or friends, unless they include an explicit disclaimer. The rule also prohibits brands from offering any sort of incentive to prompt such an action. Suppressing negative reviews is no longer allowed, nor is promoting reviews that a company knows or should know are fake. Phony online reviews are harmful not just because they mislead consumers but because they create unfair competition. FTC Chair Lina M. Khan said in a statement: “By strengthening the FTC’s toolkit to fight deceptive advertising, the final rule will protect Americans from getting cheated, put businesses that unlawfully game the system on notice, and promote markets that are fair, honest, and competitive.” Recent developments point toward the fake reviews problem finally being taken seriously. Just last month, Google updated its review restrictions document with new business profile restrictions for policy violations. It stated that any Google Maps business profile caught with a fake review will be unable to receive new reviews for a given period, have its existing reviews or ratings unable to be published for a specific time period, and have the page show a warning message to users informing them about non-compliant reviews having been removed. Browsers have also experimented with solutions by offering proprietary services to weed out fake online reviews. Last October, Firefox began testing a new tool, Review Checker, powered by Firefox-acquired Fakespot, that is supposed to automatically filter out misleading reviews and counterfeit products as you shop. The tool is now available as a built-in shopping feature on the browser. \nFTC  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The farm equipment giant has fought against letting farmers repair their own equipment for years.\n         \n          If she wins in November, there are indicators that Harris will keep the controversial FTC head, a new report claims.\n         \n          Subscription providers will be required to inform customers what they're signing up for, obtain customer consent, and provide clear mechanisms to cancel.\n         \n          A scathing new report takes aim directly at Big Tech and alleged violations of privacy.\n         \n          1Health.io left its customers genetic information unsecured in unencrypted and publicly accessible AWS servers.\n         \n          The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is calling this a victory as it holds back the American worker.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Companies will soon have to make it as easy to cancel a subscription as they made it to sign up for one under a new Federal Trade Commission rule aimed at ending predatory business practices that lock consumers into paying for services they don’t want. If you sign up for an account online, the company must provide a simple way to cancel the subscription online. If you sign up in person, you must be allowed to cancel in person or over the phone. Additionally, the rule requires companies to provide clear and truthful information to subscribers about what they’re signing up for and obtain consent before enrolling them in a negative option feature, which is a subscription model in which the customer is signed up for a service and continuously charged unless they take additional—often hidden—steps to reject the subscription. “Too often, businesses make people jump through endless hoops just to cancel a subscription,” FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement. “The FTC’s rule will end these tricks and traps, saving Americans time and money. Nobody should be stuck paying for a service they no longer want.” The FTC approved the new rule on a 3-2 vote. Several provisions were removed from the agency’s earlier drafts of the rule, including a requirement that sellers remind customers of their ability to opt out of a subscription annually and a requirement that sellers obtain customers’ consent before offering them additional deals in order to entice them to stay in a subscription. Most of the new rule’s provisions will take effect 180 days after it is published in the Federal Register. Business groups seeking to kill the new rule had argued that they receive very few complaints from customers who are unable to cancel their subscriptions and that adding a simple click-to-cancel feature to websites would lead to customers accidentally canceling services they wanted. But in its announcement of the new rule, the FTC said the number of complaints it receives about difficult-to-cancel subscriptions has been on the rise, from an average of 42 per day in 2021 up to 70 per day in 2024. Over the past several years, the agency has also sued several prominent tech companies for operating predatory subscription services. It alleged Amazon “duped” millions of people into enrolling in Amazon Prime and then used dark patterns to make it difficult to cancel those subscriptions. The FTC also accused Adobe of making it difficult to cancel its services and hiding information about early termination fees that it charged customers when they did cancel. \nDark PatternsFTCLina Khan  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The FTC's ban on writing, buying, or selling fake reviews is officially in effect.\n         \n          The farm equipment giant has fought against letting farmers repair their own equipment for years.\n         \n          If she wins in November, there are indicators that Harris will keep the controversial FTC head, a new report claims.\n         \n          A scathing new report takes aim directly at Big Tech and alleged violations of privacy.\n         \n          1Health.io left its customers genetic information unsecured in unencrypted and publicly accessible AWS servers.\n         \n          The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is calling this a victory as it holds back the American worker.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib recently sent a letter to Kroger over the grocery giant’s purported plan to introduce digital price tags that could be changed in an instant to raise or lower prices for shoppers based on the time of day, the weather, or any other number of factors. But one particular detail in Kroger’s plan is raising the most eyebrows: The company intends to put cameras in stores that would be used for facial recognition. News leaked over the summer that grocery giant Kroger was partnering with Microsoft to use electronic shelf labels, shortened in the grocery industry as ESLs, as part of an AI push to institute dynamic pricing at its grocery stores. The plan also includes so-called Enhanced Display for Grocery Environment (EDGE) shelf displays that would reportedly include cameras to capture customer information, including images of faces to better tailor ads. But Rep. Tlaib, whose home state of Michigan has 120 Kroger locations, expressed concern about these technologies in her letter dated Oct. 11 and shared Tuesday for the first time publicly. “Studies have shown that facial recognition technology is flawed and can lead to discrimination in predominantly Black and brown communities,” Tlaib said in her letter. “The racial biases of facial recognition technology are well-documented and should not be extended into our grocery stores.” Kroger is the largest grocery store chain in the U.S. by revenue and owns a number of different brands, including Ralphs, Fred Meyer, Pick’n Save, Food 4 Less, and Dillions, among a host of others. Tlaib is worried that ESLs will allow Kroger’s stores to “use customer data to build personalized profiles of each customer” in such a way that it will be able to “determine the maximum price of goods customers are willing to pay.” The plan for dynamic pricing and highly individualized advertising has drawn comparisons to the 2002 futuristic sci-fi movie Minority Report, in which Tom Cruise’s character gets served ads targeting someone with a Japanese surname because he’s been implanted with another man’s eyes. Kroger told Gizmodo in an emailed statement on Wednesday that the company’s business model “is built on a foundation of lowering prices to attract more customers,” claiming that “customers are shopping more with Kroger now than ever because we are fighting inflation and providing great value.” But Kroger didn’t agree with claims that ESLs would be used to raise prices. “To be clear, Kroger does not and has never engaged in ‘surge pricing.’ Any test of electronic shelf tags is designed to lower prices for more customers where it matters most. To suggest otherwise is not true,” the statement continued. That quote is identical to a statement CNN received from an unnamed Kroger spokesperson defending the technology in August. Tlaib’s letter isn’t the first from lawmakers expressing concern about facial recognition. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bob Casey, both Democrats, sent a letter to Kroger back in August asking questions about the company’s plans. As the lawmakers phrased it, facial recognition could be used to “exploit sensitive customer data.” The letter from Warren and Casey noted that analysts are worried dynamic pricing for grocery stores means food could soon be priced like airline tickets, creating a sense of urgency and scarcity that wouldn’t otherwise exist with static prices. It’s unclear whether Warren and Casey have received satisfactory answers to their lists of questions. Kroger is under increased scrutiny over the company’s $24.6 billion merger with Albertson’s, which is currently making its way through state courts in Washington and Colorado over anti-trust concerns. Two Kroger executives took the stand in Denver District Court on Tuesday arguing that it needs to acquire Albertson’s as a way to compete against Walmart’s grocery business, according to the Denver Post. The FTC has also challenged the merger, arguing that it would reduce competition and raise prices for consumers. \nAdvertisingdynamic pricingFoodgroceryKrogersurge pricingtargeted ads  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Vegetable breeders at Oregon State University have produced two new habanero peppers that they say pack all the flavor without the heat.\n         \n          \"I think this was orchestrated by deep state Harris supporters after Trump’s visit to McDonald’s,\" one Trump supporter wrote.\n         \n          USDA didn't have a list of products for consumers to avoid during the initial recall of 10 million pounds of chicken last week.\n         \n          The CDC warns it can take 10 weeks for some people to develop symptoms from listeria.\n         \n          Would you want to drive a truck that was constantly listening to you?\n         \n          It looks like a huge amount of advertisers are considering pulling out of Musk's site in 2025.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

Ads for these products used images captured at the scene by Doug Mills for the New York Times and Evan Vucci for the Associated Press, showing Trump yelling “fight” after the shooting. The Trump campaign itself even offered some gear commemorating his survival. As the Secret Service drew scrutiny and law enforcement searched for a motive, online advertisers saw a business opportunity in the moment, pumping out Facebook ads to supporters hungry for merch. In the 10 weeks after the shooting, advertisers paid Meta between $593,000 and $813,000 for political ads that explicitly mentioned the assassination attempt, according to The Markup’s analysis. (Meta provides only estimates of spending and reach for ads in its database.) Even Facebook itself has acknowledged that polarizing content and misinformation on its platform has incited real-life violence. An analysis by CalMatters and The Markup found that the reverse is also true: real-world violence can sometimes open new revenue opportunities for Meta. While the spending on assassination ads represents a sliver of Meta’s $100 billion-plus ad revenue, the company also builds its bottom line when tragedies like war and mass shootings occur, in the United States and beyond. After the October 7th attack on Israel last year and the country’s response in Gaza, Meta saw a major increase in dollars spent related to the conflict, according to our review. Tech advocacy groups and others question whether Facebook should even profit from violence and whether its ability to do so violates the company’s own principles of not calling for violence. The company said advertisers often respond to current events and that ads that run on its platform are reviewed and must meet the company’s standards. If you count all of the political ads mentioning Israel since the attack through the last week of September, organizations and individuals paid Meta between $14.8 and $22.1 million dollars for ads seen between 1.5 billion and 1.7 billion times on Meta’s platforms. Meta made much less for ads mentioning Israel during the same period the year before: between $2.4 and $4 million dollars for ads that were seen between 373 million and 445 million times.  At the high end of Meta’s estimates, this was a 450 percent increase in Israel-related ad dollars for the company. (In our analysis, we converted foreign currency purchases to current U.S. dollars.) The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a lobbying group that promotes Israel, was the major spender on ads mentioning Israel. In the six months after October 7th, its spending increased more than 300 percent over the previous six months, to between $1.8 and $2.7 million dollars, as the organization peppered Facebook and Instagram with ads defending Israel’s actions in Gaza and pressuring politicians to support the country. As the war has roiled the region, AIPAC paid Meta about as much for ads in the 15 weeks following October 7th as the entire year before. “Our effort is directed to encouraging pro-Israel Americans to stand with our democratic ally as it battles Iranian proxies in the aftermath of the barbaric Hamas attack of October 7th,” Marshall Wittmann, a spokesperson for AIPAC, said in an emailed statement. Other ad campaigns mentioning Israel supported different sides of the conflict. Doctors Without Borders, for example, used advertising to highlight the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Other ads defended and promoted Israel. The Christian Broadcasting Network tied the October 7th attack to a claim in an ad that Iran’s “final, deadly goal” was “to establish a modern caliphate—an Islamic-founded, tyrannical government—across the world.” Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, takes in the vast majority of its revenue from targeted advertising. The company tracks users online to profile their habits and, when a business or organization wants to reach them, lets those businesses pay to send ads to people who might be interested. Those ads might be tied to something perfectly wholesome, like gardening. But the company’s algorithms don’t distinguish between simple hobbies and something darker. Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton said in an emailed statement that Meta did not ultimately profit from political violence, as advertisers broadly back away from advertising during times of strife for fear their ads will be promoted alongside news of the violence. Clayton noted Meta’s chief financial officer recently said on an earnings call that it is “hard for us to attribute demand softness directly to any specific geopolitical event” but had seen lower ad spending “correlating with the start of the conflict” in the Middle East, and had seen similar at the start of the war in Ukraine. “Advertisers responding to current events are nothing new, and it’s seen across the media landscape, including on television, radio, and online news outlets,” Clayton said. “All ads that run on our platform must go through a review process and adhere to our advertising and community standards, and Meta offers an extra layer of transparency by making them publicly available in our Ad Library.” CalMatters and The Markup used Meta’s own tools to calculate how much Meta makes from spikes in advertising when instances of political violence happen, reviewing thousands of ads through both manual review and with the assistance of an AI model offered by Meta itself. (We also made improvements to Meta Research’s scripts for accessing the Ad Library API, and we’re sharing our changes.) To examine the assassination attempt merchandise, we ran a simple search of Meta’s Ad Library for ads that mentioned “assassination,” including any in our analysis that also mentioned “Trump” and hundreds of others that didn’t mention the former president by name but were clearly related to the shooting. “First they jail him, now they try to end him,” one ad read. A conspiratorial ad for a commemorative two-dollar bill claimed “the assassination attempt was their Plan B,” while “Plan A was to make Biden abandon the presidential campaign.” Some ads used clips from the film JFK to suggest an unseen, malevolent force was at work in the shooting. Gun advocates paid for ads, using the assassination attempt as a foreboding call to action. One ad promoting a firearms safety course noted that “November is fast approaching.” A clothing business said in an ad that, since “the government can’t save you” from foreign enemies, Americans “need to be self-reliant, self-made, and self-sufficient.” “Because when those bullets zip by, you are clearly on your own,” the ad read. Most of those ads did not appear to violate Meta’s policies, although some may have broken its ban against showing weapons while alleging “election-related corruption.” But even the ones that didn’t clearly violate Meta’s rules still place the company in an uncomfortable position, as the business takes in advertising dollars from posts tied to grim news cycles. CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself commented on the first Trump assassination attempt, saying in an interview that it was “one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen in my life.” Trump has now survived a second apparent assassination attempt, and Zuckerburg’s company has made millions of dollars through political advertising tied to these and other violent acts. Katie Paul, director of the Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit advocacy organization, said “it’s not a surprise” that ads around political violence would pop up after incidents “if Meta is not making any effort even on a good day to effectively enforce their policies.” “There’s huge problems with their advertising broadly,” she said. “They’re profiting off of a lot of harmful things, really without any sort of repercussions.” Many businesses paying for the assassination ads sold pro-Trump gear before the shooting — and some might have spent a similar amount on ads if the shooting never happened. But for some, the assassination attempt effectively became an entire business strategy, according to the review of Meta advertising data. A clothing company called Red First, which offers everything from customized shirts for pet owners to flags saying “Hillary belongs in prison,” offered assassination-related merchandise through a network of pages with names like 50 Stars Nation and Red White and Blue Zone. The company, which operates in California and Vietnam, according to Meta’s required disclosures, has spent more than $1.8 million since February 2023 to promote ads through its various pages. But in the wake of the shooting, the company pivoted to merchandise around the event. Red First’s ads were relatively innocuous compared to some that sprang up after the shooting – they promoted Trump, not the shooting, and not the idea of retaliation for it. One shirt showed an illustration of Trump, middle fingers in the air, and the words “you missed bigly.” The company has also offered Kamala Harris merchandise, recently launching a page dedicated to it as well. But the ads related to the shooting simultaneously sold products, promoted Trump, and let Meta reap advertising cash from the incident. Many of the thousands of ads posted by the company didn’t explicitly use the word “assassination,” but clearly referenced the event in other ways, using slogans like “he will overcome,” “fight fight fight,” “legends never die,” and “shooting makes me stronger.” To suss out which ads were related to the shooting, we reviewed more than 4,200 ads from the company’s different pages with the assistance of a large language model named Llama, a Meta AI model. We programmed the model to evaluate the text of each ad to determine whether it was related to the assassination attempt, then manually reviewed hundreds of its classifications to ensure it was working as expected. After our review, we determined that more than 2,600 of those more than 4,200 ads were related to the assassination attempt. The total Red First paid to Meta in the 10 weeks after the shooting for those ads: between $473,000 and $798,000. Red First lists a phone number and street address in Southern California, but didn’t respond to phone or email, and the listed address is for a mail-opening service. The advocacy organization the Tech Transparency Project has charted how the National Rifle Association has paid to promote pro-gun views on Meta and Google’s ad platforms after mass shootings. Despite calls from tech company executives for gun control, those companies profit from NRA spending that spikes after shootings, the group has pointed out. After the mass school shooting in Parkland, Fla., the NRA increased its spending on Google and Facebook ads, the Tech Transparency Project noted in one report. In 2018, the year of the shooting, Meta received “more than $2 million in advertising fees from the NRA starting in May of that year,” the report found, which also found that “NRA ad spending reached its highest levels on Google and soared on Facebook” following a week of mass shootings the following year that left dozens of people dead. Just days before the January 6th insurrection, the Tech Transparency Project found that Meta hosted ads offering gun holsters and rifle accessories in far-right Facebook groups. Internationally, Meta has often lapsed in its pledge to keep violent content off its platforms. Meta’s ad policies forbid calling for violence. But when faced with crucial tests of its content moderation practices, the company has repeatedly failed to detect and remove inflammatory ads. A 2018 report, commissioned by Facebook itself, found that its platform had been used to incite violence in Myanmar, and that the company hadn’t done enough to prevent it. Alia Al Ghussain, a researcher on technology issues at Amnesty International, said that as troubling as some ads might be in English, ads in other languages may be even more likely to pass Meta’s content moderation. “In most of the non-English-speaking world, Facebook doesn’t have the resources that it needs to moderate the content on the platform effectively and safely,” she said. Despite later admitting responsibility for violence in Myanmar, the company continues to be faulted for gaps in its international moderation work. Another advocacy organization found in a test that the company approved calls for the murder of ethnic groups in Ethiopia. More recently, a similar test by an advocacy organization found that ads explicitly calling for violence against Palestinians—a flagrant violation of Meta’s rules—were still approved to run by the company. “If ads which are presenting a risk of stoking tension or spreading misinformation are being approved in the US, in English, it really makes me fearful for what is happening in other countries in non-English-speaking languages,” Al Ghussain said.

            "content": "Martin Shkreli has been fighting a $64.6 million fine he acquired in 2022 for blocking affordable alternatives to Daraprim, a lifesaving antiparasitic drug. Shockingly, it turns out nobody on the Supreme Court cares to hear about it. No justices dissented on Monday when the court said it declined to hear an appeal by representatives of the former pharmaceutical executive. In a last-ditch effort, Shkreli’s lawyers asked the Supreme Court to resolve conflicting rulings after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the $64.6 million order and a lifetime ban to block Shkreli from working in the drug business. Only, the conflicting rulings didn’t even exist, New York Attorney General Letitia James argued in an August brief. The Supreme Court had nothing to add when it snubbed Shkreli. The so-called “pharma bro” rose to infamy as the chief of Turing Pharmaceuticals — later called Vyera. In 2015, the startup bought exclusive rights to Daraprim and jacked up its price from $13.50 to $750 a pill. At the time, there were no generic alternatives to the toxoplasmosis medication, which is used to treat a rare condition that affects pregnant people, babies, and people with HIV and cancer. Shkreli, also temporarily the owner of a secret Wu-Tang Clan album, was convicted of securities fraud and sentenced to seven years in prison in a 2017 case unrelated to Daraprim. In a comment to Gizmodo at the time, Shkreli said he planned to “make paper from inside” while serving time. Two years later, the former executive reportedly faced solitary confinement for trying to run a company with a contraband phone. Shkreli got out of prison in 2022 and promptly announced a Web3-based drug discovery venture called Druglike. His other recent projects include launching a medical chatbot called Dr. Gupta and taking credit for a cryptocurrency named after former President Donald Trump. Turing filed for bankruptcy and moved to sell the rights to Daraprim in 2023. \nDaraprimMartin ShkreliSupreme court  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The Trump family ties to the crypto industry are growing, Eric and Don Jr. apparently have a new gimmick up their sleeves.\n         \n          Another state finds itself with fewer porn options.\n         \n          A recent Supreme Court decision affirmed that a sitting president has legal immunity.

            "content": "Elon Musk’s X is dropping Unilever from its lawsuit against a group of advertisers and brands that opted to stop purchasing ads on the platform. Unilever is a major packaged foods company that owns the likes of Dove and Ben & Jerry’s. “X is pleased to have reached an agreement with Unilever and to continue our partnership with them on the platform,” it wrote in a post. “Today’s news is part of the ecosystem-wide solution and we look forward to more resolution across the industry.” No word on what “ecosystem-wide solution” means. X has been on a scorched-earth campaign against anyone and everyone who Musk perceives as having harmed its advertising business since he took over. Advertising makes up the majority of X’s business, though it’s trying to grow Premium into a larger source of revenue. Last fall, the company sued the nonprofit Media Matters for America after it reported that ads for major brands were appearing alongside Nazi content. In the wake of the report, IBM and others stopped advertising on X. Then this summer, X announced an antitrust lawsuit against the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), which led an industry initiative called the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM). In essense, brands who signed on to GARM agreed to stop advertising on any platform that didn’t meet certain brand safety standards. It wasn’t specific to X, but the company claimed this group was specifically conspiring to “collectively withold billions of dollars in advertising revenue” from its platform. The post from X announcing the news today makes it sound awfully like Unilever had to pay in order to get dropped from the suit. We don’t really know, it could be as simple as Unilever just decided it wanted to come back to the platform. Other brands like Mars and CVS are still named. Unilever has not responded to a request for comment. After Musk took over X—when it was still called Twitter—major advertisers like Hyundai immediately paused advertising as they sought to wait and see whether Musk would turn the platform into a cesspool with his new mandate to allow any content that was not illegal. Musk famously told Disney CEO Bob Iger and other advertisers to “go fuck yourself” during an interview when asked about advertisers opting to leave the platform, claiming they were attacking free speech. The problem with Musk’s laissez-faire content moderation plan is that brands generally want the public to associate them with positivity. When you see snow and polar bears around Christmas you think of Coca-Cola, for instance. It creates a positive association. Coca-Cola (or *cough* Volkswagen) does not want you to see Nazi content or dead bodies and think of them. News media suffers the same problem—advertisers often don’t want their brands placed alongside articles about death and war. X isn’t the only platform that’s seen advertisers flee in response to harmful content either. YouTube famously experienced a damaging “adpocalypse” in 2016 in which major brands paused spending after they found their advertisements appearing against harmful content. And shockingly, YouTube did not sue claiming collusion or conspiracy. It just cleaned up the content. It’s not just advertisers who don’t like toxic content. Users don’t really want to see harmful content either, which is why Threads and Bluesky are growing and extreme platforms like Truth never seem to take off. But somehow Musk seems to think he’s entitled to advertising dollars. Estimates find that X has lost at least 80 percent of its advertising revenue since Musk took over. Meta properties like Facebook and Instagram are more insulated from advertiser boycotts in general, because many small and medium-sized businesses advertise there. Historically, most of Twitter’s advertising revenue came from a smaller number of major brands. That means only a few major advertising agencies or brands need to pull from X in order to create huge damage. It also doesn’t help that, even before Musk bought it, the platform was small compared to the likes of Instagram and Snapchat. Advertisers can leave X and move their spending elsewhere without causing much problem for sales. \nElon MuskTWITTERx  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The case is a scary peek at the future of buying votes.\n         \n          Philadelphia District Attorney called the giveaway a \"grift\" and \"one of the great scams of the last 50 years.\"\n         \n          With hours to go before America votes, Trump’s surrogates spent their time building up a myth around a squirrel.\n         \n          Now when you block someone they won't be able to interact with you, but they can still view your posts.\n         \n          Musk has spent at least $120 million to get Donald Trump elected.\n         \n          Musk’s lawyers are doing everything they can to delay legal action around his $1 million voter lottery until after election day.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Proponents of the “Network State” seek to create privately owned, anarcho-capitalist, “autonomous” cities—the likes of which will be the urban planning equivalent of what cryptocurrency did to money. The endgame of this bizarre tech-fueled ideological movement is basically a high-tech version of Galt’s Gulch, the utopian libertarian society in Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged that rich nerds have long lusted after. One of the more prominent developments connected to it is a proposed new city dubbed “Praxis.” Dryden Brown, the 28-year-old founder and CEO behind the project, recently said that the urban development plan was an effort to “create a more heroic, more interesting place than anything we’ve seen”—whatever that means. Brown hopes to eventually create his new city in the Caribbean, though he hasn’t revealed a specific location yet and the details of the project have been kept under wraps. This week, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Praxis project had attained $525 million in new funding. A big part of that funding—$500 million—comes from crypto investment firm GEM Digital. The money from GEM is being offered as part a “drawdown financing facility,” a type of loan wherein capital is dispersed only after certain conditions are met by both parties. As part of this business arrangement, GEM will get crypto tokens from Praxis that amount to some approximation of ownership in the deal. In turn, money from the drawdown will be released to Praxis after it lists those crypto tokens on a public crypto exchange, the Journal reports. Praxis also recently secured another $25 million from financial lender Arch Lending, the paper writes. Despite now having access to hundreds of millions of dollars, it should be noted that Praxis is still basically just an idea. And it’s an idea being championed by an Ayn-Rand-loving guy (Brown) who, by his own admission (as reported by the New York Times), dropped out of college, somehow landed a job as a hedge fund analyst, was fired from said hedge fund, and then, at some point in his mid-twenties, decided that his life’s mission should be to build a new city. Despite having a limited list of accomplishments to his name, Brown seems to have lived a fairly charmed life that has involved parties, travel, hobnobbing with the 1 percent, and business deals of a vague and colorful nature. That would seem to make him a relatively good fit for the “Network State” movement, which is full of people who have big dreams but don’t seem tethered particularly tightly to reality. For instance, another advocate for the movement is Balaji Srinivasan, the former chief technology officer of Coinbase, who recently started his own school, the likes of which is dedicated to teaching people about the tenets of the Network State philosophy. “California Forever,” the quixotic effort to create a new, privately owned city on thousands of acres of Bay Area farmland, has also been accused of being part of the movement. The “Network State” worldview is obsessed with cryptocurrency and sees speculative digital assets as the key to the weird high-tech future it wants to see manifest. Such virulent, closely held beliefs lead to utopia-flecked sentences, culled from the Praxis website, like this one: “The next wave of crypto adoption, on the path to crypto civilization, requires crypto infrastructure’s integration into the core functions of society.” Or this one: “Large aligned communities in Network States will use on-chain infrastructure to power their payments, contracts, identity, communications, and physical infrastructure.” As you can see, we are dealing with a rare breed of political fanaticism here. This would be more funny than scary were it not for the fact that the people backing this movement have so much money that they have effectively begun to hijack the U.S. political system. The crypto industry has poured money into this election cycle, accounting for nearly half of the total corporate cash spent on political action committees this year. With that kind of dough, the crypto industry has sought to underwrite the U.S. presidential election (with ample cash thrown at its favored candidate, Donald Trump), while also taking aim at its political enemies—namely, Democrats, but they’re slowly moving to the other side. \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n      Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "It’s been a wild few days for tech billionaire Elon Musk. On Wednesday, the Justice Department warned him that his $1 million giveaway to swing state voters might be illegal. And then on Thursday The Wall Street Journal broke the news that Musk has been having private conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin for years. According to the Journal, Musk has been chatting with Putin since 2022. The Journal based its reporting on conversations with officials in the U.S., Europe, and Russia. It’s been an open secret in powerful political circles for years. What do the world’s richest man and a brutal authoritarian have to discuss? Quite a bit, as it turns out. They’ve reportedly chatted about business, personal issues, and the state of the world. Musk is an important government contractor with a security clearance and hands in a lot of different companies. SpaceX alone has billions in government contracts, and some of them are so sensitive that the very nature of them is classified, including one issued in 2021 for $1.8 billion. Musk’s Starlink has proved an incredible battleground tool. The satellite internet service has been instrumental in keeping lines of communication open in the war in Ukraine. Musk has donated more than a thousand Starlink terminals to Kyiv, and the Pentagon has footed the bill for hundreds more. But they don’t always work like they should. Last year, Ukrainian drone operators complained that the signal to drones above the Black Sea cut out as they approached Russian-occupied Crimea. Starlink has repeatedly said that its terminals are not meant to be weapons of war and should be reserved for civilian use. But the terminals keep popping up in Russia as well, arriving there from other countries. And Moscow has been using them for war. When Starlink catches the rogue terminals, it cuts them off. According to the Journal, Musk and Putin have chatted about Starlink during their various private conversations. Putin asked Musk to not activate Starlink terminals in Taiwan. He wanted the billionaire to do it as a personal favor to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Again, Musk has a security clearance. He’s an important military contractor whom the Pentagon relies on to efficiently conduct the business of war. He’s also a reckless fool who has involved himself with a foreign dictator and injected himself into domestic politics. The man is a national security risk, full stop. And though the Pentagon has investigated him and reprimanded him over his public and rumored drug use, it has yet to pull his security clearance. When Semafor asked NASA Administrator Bill Nelson about the story on Friday, Nelson said he’d mostly dealt with people other than Musk and that SpaceX had been “phenomenally successful.” “I don’t know if that story is true. I think it should be investigated.” Nelson added. “If it’s true there have been multiple conversations with Elon Musk and the president of Russia, then that would be concerning, particularly for NASA and the Department of Defense, for some of the intelligence agencies. Asked about the WSJ report on Elon Musk's conversations with Putin, @SenBillNelson tells @burgessev: \"[SpaceX] have been phenomenally successful … I don't know that that story is true. I think it should be investigated. If the story is true … that would be concerning.\" pic.twitter.com/5Mlo2AEDNx — Semafor (@semafor) October 25, 2024  None of it may matter if Donald Trump becomes the next president of the United States. And Musk is doing his damndest to make that happen. The billionaire has been spending money on the Trump campaign like it’s going out of style. He’s never been politically neutral, but he’s also never been this personally involved in a candidate. Through his America PAC and other offerings, Musk has shoveled an estimated $118.5 million into the campaign since the summer. Musk is also offering $47 to registered swing state voters willing to sign a petition saying they’re in support of free speech and the Second Amendment. Signing the petition also enters people into a lottery with the chance to win $1 million. Musk has promised he’ll give away a huge cash prize to one petition signer every day until the election as he attempts to make himself into the MrBeast of politics. If that sounds weird and illegal, you’re not the only one who thinks that. Only petition signers in the states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, and North Carolina are eligible for the payday. And though the petition and its rules aren’t explicit about who those voters should cast a ballot for, it’s hard to imagine anyone signing doesn’t know who Musk would prefer. After Musk announced the sweepstakes, the Justice Department sent a letter of warning to his America PAC. The DOJ told the PAC that the lottery may violate federal election law. But Musk is still giving away prizes. Last night, just before 11 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, the America PAC published a picture of Jason Holland of Michigan holding a large novelty check. Holland grinned in his photo above a link directing people to sign the petition. \nelection 2024Elon MuskPutinStarlinkTrump  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          The case is a scary peek at the future of buying votes.\n         \n          Philadelphia District Attorney called the giveaway a \"grift\" and \"one of the great scams of the last 50 years.\"\n         \n          New York Times tech workers are protesting for a fair contract the day before the U.S. election.\n         \n          With hours to go before America votes, Trump’s surrogates spent their time building up a myth around a squirrel.\n         \n          Musk has spent at least $120 million to get Donald Trump elected.\n         \n          Musk’s lawyers are doing everything they can to delay legal action around his $1 million voter lottery until after election day.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "I’ve been uncomfortable ever since I learned (via TechCrunch) about this toilet seat with a camera that takes pictures of your poop. Courtesy of an Austin-based health startup, Throne, this seat is currently available to preorder for $299 or $499 if you purchase it after the preorder period ends. It’s in beta mode at the moment. The concept is to photograph your feces so the seat can provide feedback on your gut health and hydration levels. It’s powered by an AI model that Throne calls “artificial gut intelligence.” According to the company, the AI is “trained by physicians to help you understand what your waste is trying to tell you about your health.” This makes the seat suitable for folks with gut health issues but could also help perfectly healthy people. Of course, the biggest concern here is privacy, which Throne has tried its best to defend. It has a dedicated privacy and security page on the site that outlines everything it’s done to ensure it. First, it promises the images to strictly capture the toilet bowl and nothing else, adding, “We use image recognition technology to automatically delete any non-relevant images” and “Any other data is irrelevant to our mission and could compromise our ability to provide accurate health insights.” It also mentions that you can contact the company here at any time to request access to your information or demand an account deletion. Throne clarifies that the images are all anonymized and not shared with third parties. Despite the many security measures, I’m unsure how I’d feel about this incredibly invasive tech clipping onto my toilet seat. As someone with no gut health issues, I don’t have much reason to go for it, but it’d be interesting to show this to my perpetually constipated sister and see if it’s something she’d ever consider. TechCrunch mentions that Throne started as a healthcare staffing marketplace but soon realized the space was overly saturated. It then pivoted to producing consumer tech and chose a camera-installed toilet seat as its debut. Toilet seats can really do it all these days. I recently checked out Toto’s new washlet that does a ridiculous number of things for you, including auto-opening and closing, pre-misting the bowl before use, heating up, washing and drying your butt and the seat, deodorizing the air when you’re done with your business, among many other functions. So maybe a toilet that’ll tell you if your poop is healthy doesn’t seem too much of a stretch. \nCamerasSmart Home  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Picture a HomePod with a display as big as two iPhones placed side by side.\n         \n          The Altas PT Ultra lasts more than a year on a single charge and retails for only $180.\n         \n          Google TV also has a new dedicated sports panel to see scores in realtime.\n         \n          Drone maker DJI plans to take on GoPro with its Osmo Action 5’s better low-light quality and improved sensor it claims rivals professional cameras.\n         \n          The future of drone warfare could hinge on the unique structures found in your laziest pet's peepers.\n         \n          This Wall-E style robot will do everything except take out your trash.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "content": "Hasbro’s awesome HasLab program just announced another release and this time around our first thought is “That’s a big Twinkie.” The toy company is once again back to the world of Ghostbusters and this time it’s bringing to life arguably the most iconic piece in the franchise, the Ecto-1. Oh, sure there have been Ecto-1s before. All kinds. But never in Habro’s sixth-scale “Plasma Series” like this. It measures almost 24 inches long, 10 inches high, and eight inches wide. It’s a beast and, as is the case with all HasLabs, this one is filled with all sorts of cool details, extra add-ons, and more. “The HasLab Lab worked directly with our partners at Ghost Corps to create the most authentic and movie-accurate 6-inch-scale Ectomobile possible,” the site writes. “Our design team was even able to visit and photograph an actual Ecto, and boy howdy, did they get all up in that car’s business, as indicated by the eerily insane amount of detail included in this six-inch-scale replica.” Two versions are available—the Ghostbusters Plasma Series Ectomobile (Anniversary Edition) [Base Model] at $325 and the Ghostbusters Plasma Series Ectomobile (Anniversary Edition) [Deluxe Model] for $400. Which, yes, is expensive, but look at this baby and tell us it isn’t worth it. These are just a few images. For the money though, it’s almost silly not to order the deluxe one. For an extra $75 you get—bare minimum—four brand new Ghostbusters figures that can go inside the Ecto-1. Each of those is worth $20-$25 each. Plus, you get a bunch of cool little trinkets that let you change it into the brighter, louder version from Ghostbusters II. But, if you don’t want to spend that much, both do come with the cool Librarian figure as well as the Slimer figure and, if the project gets fully funded in two weeks, a Louis Tully figure. Which, come on… that’s worth $400 alone. But, yes, this is HasLab so it’s big, expensive, and not guaranteed. It only gets made if 12,000 people back it in 45 days. But, since 3,000 people have backed it as we write this, and it’s only been up a few hours, we’d imagine it’ll hit that goal very soon.

Have you put much thought into what you’re getting your family and friends this year? If you have not, maybe first start with a gift for yourself. You can set yourself up with a Costco gold star membership and then get all your gifts this year at Costco. The place has pretty much everything after all. Right now, StackSocial is promoting a deal in which you can get a yearlong membership for just $65 and it will include a $45 digital gift card, which you might as well put toward your holiday shopping. See at StackSocial This past summer, StackSocial was running a similar deal, but it only granted new members a measly $20 gift card. Now the bonus has been more than doubled to $45. That’s so many more $1.50 hot dogs you can buy (30 of them total). And that price is not changing anytime soon, as many folks know, the the founder of Costco allegedly told a CEO who wanted to raise it, “If you raise the effing hot dog, I will kill you.” A Costco gold membership will allow you to shop at over 600 locations within the United States as well as over 800 locations worldwide. You’ll be able to use your card at Costco’s business centers, travel, gas stations, hearing aid centers, optical, pharmacies and, of course, Costco’s website. You can share the membership among anyone in your household. Just send them off with the household card and they’ll be permitted to shop at a Costco location. If you want even more perks for yourself, you can sign up instead for the executive membership. With that, you’ll gain all the perks that come along with the gold membership, but you’ll also be privy to additional benefits and greater discounts on select Costco services. These include lower prices on check printing and free roadside assistance through vehicles in the auto insurance program. You’ll also be granted an annual 2% reward (up to $1,250) on qualified Costco purchases. The Costco gold membership is going for just $65 while the executive membership is $130. Both come with the digital Costco shop card. Upon signing up, the $45 Costco card will be sent directly via email from Costco within two weeks after successfully redeeming. The digital credit is not just one-time use, so you don’t have to spend the $45 at once.

Marshall has been in the sound business for over 60 years, having first started with it’s JTM45 guitar amplifier.

Decades later, Marshal is still committed with crafting great products with its signature sound, and these wireless on-ear Bluetooth headphones are no different.

            "content": "Amazon Prime over the years has expanded to include a hodgepodge of benefits, and starting today members will begin receiving a new one: fuel discounts. Starting with gasoline, Amazon says that Prime members will receive a 10 cents per gallon discount at roughly 7,000 stations across the U.S. under the brands Amoco, AM/PM, and BP stations. The company estimates that members could save about $70 annually on fuel, which is half the price of an annual Prime membership of $139 (it’s a bit more if you pay by the month). Next year, the company will add electric vehicle charging through BP Pulse. Prime launched in 2005 offering free deliveries on Amazon.com, but today the membership program includes additional benefits like free streaming through Amazon Video, unlimited cloud photo storage, and Grubhub+ membership, to name a few. Prime has over 180 million subscribers globally and is estimated to have generated more than $40 billion in revenue for Amazon last year. Bundling has become more common in the subscription business these days as giants like Amazon seek to reduce churn and fend off competition. It’s long been in fierce rivalry against Walmart, which offers its Walmart+ membership program, which also offers similar perks to Amazon as well as free same-day delivery of groceries. By including lots of perks in the membership, Amazon hopes you’ll use a couple of them and decide it’s not worth the hassle to cancel and seek out replacements. Unfortunately, anyone who has tried shopping on Amazon in recent years knows that it’s something of a mess, with sponsored listings taking up much of the page, millions of Chinese knockoff brands of quality that is hard to discern, inconsistent product pages that make it hard to find the information you want, and fake reviews making for an overall poor shopping experience. It’s not far off from Temu or Shein at this point, and not somewhere to search for quality items. But hey, The Boys is a well-liked show, and those new Kindles look nice. Forgetting free shipping, the other perks are kind of the real reason to have a Prime subscription at this point. And if you drive a lot, the new gas discount certainly is a nice addition. \nAmazon Prime  \r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n         \r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n         \r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n     \n          Across the globe, Prime packages will now be cushioned by paper.\n         \n          A few tips to save your money and your peace of mind.\n         \n          Amazon Prime Video is rolling out a redesign that leans heavily on AI recommendations in order to streamline your viewing experience so you can get down to enjoying a movie or TV series in a quicker fashion.\n         \n          Amazon Prime Video is turning into its own nuclear wasteland with the addition of pause ads all designed to get you to buy stuff on Amazon.\n         \n          A proposed class action lawsuit accuses the e-commerce company of deceptive practices and is seeking $5 million in damages.\n         \n          Streamers of the world should revolt against this most odious of price hikes.\n          Gizmodo’s Best of 2024 Awards ➜ We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2024 GIZMODO USA LLC.
